2025-06-27 04:44:00,Shell probably won't buy BP: Here's a 'more realistic' outcome,"A potential Shell (SHEL) and BP (BP) merger is on investors' minds after The Wall Street Journal reported Shell is in early talks to acquire BP, though Shell has denied the report. Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel says it makes sense for the two energy companies to combine, but it's unlikely that Shell would buy BP outright, explaining that it's more probable that BP will sell parts of its business to Shell and others.

Here with more, we've got Rob Dummel, who is the Tortis Senior portfolio manager and managing director. Great to have you here with us. So, just take us into your analysis of the deal-making environment now through the lens of Shell and BP, and what it could mean for the sector. .Well, so, so thanks for having me. So, if you just look at what's happening in the overall sector, obviously commodity prices are down. Oil prices are down a lot. And so, it's hard for deals to be made today, uh, just because, uh, because of the low oil price. And a lot of these oil and gas producers, oil producers in particular, have really repaired their balance sheet so they don't need to do deals. But it's a little different for Shell and Shell and BP. So, if you look at the valuations of Shell and BP, they're really low. They trade at much lower valuations than their peers: Exxon, Chevron, Total. So, obviously, there are a lot of investors that are looking for ways to unlock that value. I know Elliott's been active in in BP to try to, to try to encourage them to sell several of their assets to try to realize and get the market to recognize a more of a sum of the parts type of valuation. So, does it make sense for the two to combine? Uh, yeah, it probably does longer term if you think about, then what will the what will combined entity do? It's much bigger. Um, and then ultimately what it needs to do, and I think both companies need to do, is continue to be disciplined, continue to deliver cash back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. And, and I think if you put all those together, then ultimately, you result in in an improving valuation. But, but clearly, there these, both of these stocks are at really discounted valuations. .What is the likelihood that this deal even goes through knowing that there are now more restrictions in different parts of the world for this to be necessary or be possible to take place, considering British stock regulations that have now come more into light which would mean that essentially there would be a six-month period that Shell would have to wait, uh, if this indeed was rejected and, and ultimately they would have to find, uh, some other approach. .Yeah, I, I think the odds of Shell buying BP as it is today is very low. Uh, um, what I think the more realistic, uh, possibility is that, you know, BP starts to sell off certain pieces of its business and then ultimately a combination between Shell and BP, uh, makes a little more sense. I think BP's obviously interested in the oil and gas producing assets, the Gulf of Mexico, um, some of its international oil and gas producing assets. Um, and I think BP has a little bit of LNG as well that, that that would, would be complementary. But, but uh, but there are other businesses, I think, inside of BP that that may make sense in the hands of other buyers rather than Shell.

2025-06-27 07:15:00,Shell (SHEL) Beats Stock Market Upswing: What Investors Need to Know,"The latest trading day saw Shell (SHEL) settling at $70.99, representing a +2.23% change from its previous close.","In the latest trading session, Shell (SHEL) closed at $70.99, marking a +2.23% move from the previous day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.8%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.94%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.97%..Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil and gas company had gained 5.15% outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 3.8% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.12%..The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Shell in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Shell to post earnings of $1.47 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 25.38%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $68.87 billion, indicating a 8.25% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year..For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.15 per share and a revenue of $273.19 billion, demonstrating changes of -18.22% and -5.48%, respectively, from the preceding year..It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Shell. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook..Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model..The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.19% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, Shell is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold)..Investors should also note Shell's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 11.3. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.78, so one might conclude that Shell is trading at a premium comparatively..It is also worth noting that SHEL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.81. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.81..The Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

Despite these rumors impacting its immediate stock movements, Shell's share price has grown 5.93%, somewhat aligning with the broader market's 1.7% weekly rise and 12% increase over the year. While initial rumors led to volatility, Shell's eventual clarification may have helped realign investor focus back to its existing strategies and market expectations, thereby contributing a layer of stability to its overall price movement within broader market trends..We've identified 1 possible red flag with Shell and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process..The end of cancer? These 24 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's..The rumors surrounding Shell's potential acquisition of BP, although unfounded, initially injected volatility into Shell's share price and distracted from its core operational strategies. As the company clarified its stance, investor attention refocused on its long-term initiatives involving AI and robotics, aiming for improved operational performance and net margins. These technological advances are expected to influence Shell's earnings by enhancing process safety and efficiency. Over the past five years, Shell's total shareholder return, including dividends, reached 139.36%, illustrating significant growth compared to a 12.3% decline in the UK Oil and Gas industry performance over the past year. This contrast indicates Shell's operational resilience and strategic direction..With Shell's revenue expected to decrease slightly and profit margins projected to improve from 5.7% to 7.6% over the next three years, the clarification of acquisition rumors may help stabilize medium-term expectations. Analysts forecast earnings to increase to US$21.1 billion by May 2028. However, this hinges on the company's ability to mitigate market volatility, especially in LNG, and manage execution risks associated with major projects like the Pavilion deal. The current share price of £24.4 remains below the analyst consensus price target of £29.76, highlighting a potential upside if projected earnings growth materializes. This balance between short-term market impacts and long-term operational strategies will be crucial in realizing future financial objectives and closing the value gap..Click here to discover the nuances of Shell with our detailed analytical financial health report.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-lse-shel-denies-bp-175031598.html,Market Risk Reputational Risk Operational Risk

2025-06-27 01:30:00,"After denying reports of BP takeover, Shell is legally barred from making an offer for six months—and there are no other suitors in sight",A theoretical Shell-BP combination would carry debt and antitrust issues while requiring greater layoffs and divestments.,"Shell doubled down on its denial of acquiring rival BP, claiming it has “no intention” of making an offer while invoking a U.K. law that forbids Shell from bidding on BP during the next six months with few exceptions..The June 26 news comes after reports that Shell entered early talks to buy BP in what would easily represent the largest energy deal of the century—if not ever. But with Shell seemingly stepping aside to focus on internal performance—at least for now—financially struggling BP is left without any other clear suitors as the British energy giant seeks a turnaround following its “hard reset” through cost cuts, greater fossil fuel investments, and renewables divestments..“In response to recent media speculation, Shell wishes to clarify that it has not been actively considering making an offer for BP and confirms it has not made an approach to, and no talks have taken place with BP with regards to a possible offer,” Shell said in a prepared statement..The statement was issued under a rule in the U.K.’s takeover code that bans backtracking on its claims for the next six months unless Shell has the agreement of BP’s board, another company bids on BP, or there’s a material change in circumstances. Citing the code allows Shell to better reassure its investors that it is focused on its strategy and not massive, debt-laden acquisitions at this moment..BP declined comment..Shell’s statement followed a June 25 report from the Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early talks to potentially buy BP, which also came after previous speculation and reports that Shell was studying a possible deal to combine two of the biggest Big Oil giants..“For now, any takeover of BP by Shell will be a 2026 story, and is unlikely to happen in 2025,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director for the XTB brokerage house. “BP’s share price is still underperforming its global peers, and now that Shell is out of the running as a potential buyer, we do not see BP repairing its position in the coming weeks or months.”.Indeed, only a small handful of companies could afford to acquire BP with its large, but underperforming, $80 billion market cap. London-based Shell is the most obvious, but the others—Exxon Mobil and Chevron—are coming off or are amid massive acquisitions of their own. And the U.S. supermajors could have greater antitrust challenges even if they were interested, said Deborah Byers, senior advisor at energy research and investment firm Veriten..Of note is that Shell switched its headquarters to London from the Netherlands three years ago, changing the Royal Dutch Shell name to Shell PLC.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/denying-reports-bp-takeover-shell-163034638.html,Mergers & Acquisitions Risk Financial Risk Legal & Regulatory Risk Operational Risk Reputational Risk

Its relatively cheap valuation compared to its peers makes it a firm takeover target for larger companies in the oil and gas sector..It has lost almost a quarter of its value over the last two years, while its competitors in Europe and the US have managed to grow and rake in record profits..Applying the 36% average bid premium seen on London-listed stocks so far this year implies a potential takeover valuation for BP of £78bn — representing one of the biggest takeovers ever for a FTSE 100 (^FTSE) company..Its recent strategy reset failed to go as expected, and the presence of an activist investor pushing for change is also a reason for potential acquisition. Florida-based Elliott Management is reportedly lobbying for the London-based energy giant to close several divisions and cut administrative functions, in an attempt to cut costs..The investor wants BP to close BP Ventures, its £1.2bn venture capital arm, which has supported 75 energy start-ups that BP believes may become profitable..The American activist investor also wants BP to axe its forecasting arm which predicts macroeconomic conditions such as the oil price, and cut its strategy team, which was responsible for planning BP's transition away from fossil fuels, which the company is now reversing..Shell buying BP would greatly increase its size and scale, but it may only be after certain assets rather than the company as a whole, particularly after buying BG Group for £47bn in 2015.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-takeover-target-oil-shell-135041990.html,Merger & Acquisition Risk Reputational Risk Operational Risk

Probably? Potentially?) coming to New York, and he has some big, big plans. Specifically for the city’s housing market..Late Tuesday night, New York State Assemblymember and Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, besting centrist candidate and former state Governor Andrew Cuomo. The win makes him the presumptive frontrunner in the city’s November election, and if he wins that election, he has promised to pursue a suite of housing reform policies. If they’re implemented, Mamdani could transform the real estate market of the largest US city — which already looks like a funhouse mirror version of the rest of the country’s..READ ALSO: Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’ and Bumble Swipes Left on a Third of Its Workforce.To say housing is the defining issue in current New York politics is likely an understatement. In January, the New York State Comptroller’s Office released a report stating that homelessness in the state increased by 53% between January 2023 and January 2024, more than four times the national average. The jump was driven largely by widening homelessness in the city, which has a population of more than 8 million. Meanwhile, rent prices continue to climb higher and higher; in May, the median monthly rent in Manhattan reached an all-time record of $4,571, according to a recent report by Douglas Elliman. Rental-listing site Zumper reported that the monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment leapfrogged 17.5% in the past year, more than in any other city. The city’s vacancy rate has fallen to 1.4%, the lowest point since 1968, according to the city comptroller..Mamdani ran on a housing-reform platform built on two key pillars. First, implementing an immediate rent freeze for the more than 2 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized units. Second, committing $100 billion in public funds to construct more than 200,000 new rent-stabilized units over the next decade, with fast-tracks granted to “100% affordable developments.”.The city’s landlords and developers — who almost universally backed Cuomo — are unsurprisingly critical of Mamdani’s proposals, warning that the moves could discourage new investments. On Wednesday, investors responded by fleeing companies seen as especially exposed to New York real estate:.Shares of Flagstar — a.k.a., the major New York real estate lender previously known as New York Community Bancorp — slid 4% on Wednesday, with Deutsche Bank analysts estimating as much as one-fourth of the company’s loan book would be exposed to Mamdani’s rent regulations..Meanwhile, shares of SL Green, Manhattan’s largest landlord, fell over 5%, and shares of the Vornado Realty Trust fell nearly 7% on Wednesday.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-mamdani-primary-win-mean-040100122.html,Political Risk 
2025-06-26 12:01:00,Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’,A megamerger of this sort would vault Shell's market cap closer to ExxonMobil’s $468 billion and likely beyond Chevron’s $248 billion.,"One of the world’s biggest oil companies seems to have sprung a leak – no, not in one of its tankers, in its deal room. But the information that seeped out has been called into question..On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that UK-based multinational oil giant Shell was in early-stage talks to acquire British rival BP, citing “people familiar with the matter.” It’s unknown if the newspaper’s tip was shucked from inside Shell’s yellow pecten scallop logo, beamed from BP’s green and yellow sunburst or sourced from a knowledgeable insider elsewhere. But one thing’s for certain: Shell denies it’s happening. “No talks are taking place,” a spokesperson told The Daily Upside..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Bumble Swipes Left on a Third of Its Workforce.According to the Journal’s report, Shell and BP reps are in active discussions, and BP was said to be considering the prospect of being taken over “carefully.” BP’s $82 billion market cap, which is less than half of Shell’s $210 billion, means if a deal ever materialized, its value would likely exceed that of the $83 billion ExxonMobil merger in 1999, factoring in the likely acquisition premium..The possibility of a Shell-BP merger has fascinated markets and analysts since the 1990s. Speculation has intensified in recent years as BP stumbled out of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 into a bad bet on Russia’s Rosneft that went south after the country invaded Ukraine and a series of underwhelming renewables ventures. A megamerger of this sort would, theoretically, be of interest to Shell because it would vault it closer to ExxonMobil’s $468 billion market cap and likely beyond Chevron’s $248 billion. Bloomberg reported that Shell was studying the idea of acquiring its UK rival in May, something Alphavalue analysts figured would probably involve a cash-and-stock payment..The Journal’s report on Wednesday made clear that a tie-up is “far from certain,” according to the paper’s sources. Whether the reported talks are merely “further market speculation,” as the Shell spokesperson characterized them, or not, investors took both the news and Shell’s denial seriously:.BP shares initially rose as much as 10% following the Journal’s report Wednesday, but after Shell’s rebuff, they reversed course, narrowing their gains to 1.6%. Shell shares were down 1%..“As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification,” Shell’s spokesperson added. BP did not reply to a request for comment. Even without a Shell-BP deal, the energy sector still has a major pending tie-up, with Chevron’s $53 billion acquisition of Hess awaiting the outcome of a legal challenge by Exxon over a Guyana oil field in which both it and Hess have stakes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-dismisses-bp-takeover-talks-040100971.html,No risk.
2025-06-26 06:30:00,Jerome Powell is Finally Getting Specific,"Simply put, Powell says he needs to wait and see June and July price data to know just how impactful and inflationary tariffs have been.","One way to coax some timeline specificity out of Jerome “wait-and-see” Powell? Put him on the witness stand..On Tuesday, that’s where the Fed’s top central banker spent a good chunk of his day, testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, where he clarified exactly what data he is waiting to see before moving to cut federal interest rates (today he’ll face another round of questioning from the Senate Banking Committee). The Capitol Hill field trip comes as consensus in the Fed’s ranks is starting to dissipate..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Simply put, Powell says he needs to see just how impactful and inflationary tariffs are — which he says will be clearer after the release of June and July price data. Why the lag? While tariffs arrived in full force starting in April, their widely expected inflationary effect still isn’t quite reflected in consumer prices thanks to a massive amount of stock front-loading and a reluctance to raise prices for already wary consumers. For instance, Toyota had avoided price hikes on US cars up until last week, when it told Bloomberg that its automobiles would cost (a little bit) more starting in July. Consumers, meanwhile, are growing more weary: Tuesday also delivered a fresh batch of consumer confidence data courtesy of the Conference Board, which showed increased pessimism in June driven by a tough-to-crack job market. Which of course puts Powell in a corner: a turgid economy and soft job market would normally call for rate cuts, if not for signs that more inflation is the way..Still, the central banker is leaving the door open to the possibility that tariffs won’t be as impactful as widely expected, saying Tuesday, “We’re perfectly open to the idea that the pass through [effect of tariffs] will be less than we think. And if so, that’ll matter for our policy.” That may be as much a message to inquisitive lawmakers as it is to his own underlings, some of whom are growing impatient with Powell’s approach:.After the Fed maintained its current level of interest rates for the fourth consecutive time at its meeting earlier this month, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman on Monday said she’d support a rate cut as soon as July: “All considered, ongoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky… it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate.”.That makes Bowman the second Fed official to break ranks, after Fed Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC on Friday he sees only a small risk of tariff inflation, and that the Fed could cut rates by July.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jerome-powell-finally-getting-specific-223000900.html,Monetary Policy Risk Market Risk Inflation Risk

We're watching shares of Shell, BP and Nvidia starting off with Shell, which is denying reports now from the Wall Street Journal that it's in talks to acquire BP. Julie, let's start with you on this one. You've been following, I know this story closely. .Yes, I have. And Shell is pushing back pretty forcefully against this report, which, according to the journal, said that the two were in early stage talks that might not result in a deal, but Shell in a statement to Yahoo Finance says this is further market speculation. No talks are taking place. They go on to say, as we've said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value and shell through continuing to focus on performance discipline and simplification. BP, for its part, offered no comment on this. This would be an enormous deal if it was to go through, and it was to happen. BP's market cap around $82 billion, Shell's at $210 billion. And BP really has been struggling to some extent over the past couple of years through a change in leadership, through activist investment from Elliott Management, which has been pushing for changes at the company. And I was looking at the five year performance here. BP over the past five years it is up, it's up about 29%, but Shell in that time has more than doubled. Um, so you see here and remember also that BP kind of went for from pivoting towards what it branded itself as beyond petroleum, right? Pivoting into some more renewable energy sources. And then while its competitors, including Shell, were not, and then had to kind of pivot back to its bread and butter oil and gas business. So again, Shell denying the report, but interesting as we kind of look at BP's business here. .You know, it's interesting, Mark, cause I I know there have been reports, including Bloomberg, I think back in May said Shell had been considering the merits of this one. But what do you make of the headline? .Well, look, BP has obviously underperformed over the last decade, and if anything, this might be a perfect time to consider, uh, you know, some sort of a move like this sort. I mean, crude oil has been in a three year bear market. And now all of a sudden, with the geopolitical uptick and start of wars, uh, we see a quick 20 point move and crude over the last few weeks. And so, it, you know, my thinking is that energy is slowly but surely in the process of likely bottoming out after severe underperformance. So if we see crude higher in the back half of the year, uh, it's going to make perfect sense to try to do a deal like this at a time when BP could be, you know, undervalued compared to its worth. And then, you know, as as we start to see the energy market recover, uh, you know, be a perfectly well timed, uh, time to do this strategy in my view. .Let's move on. Check out Nvidia as well. It's hosting its annual shareholder meeting today with a new all time closing price knocking at the door here. Chip giant also received the street high price target upgrade from Loop Capital. Now see the stock reaching 250 analysts. They are talking about the next golden wave of gen AI adoption. They say Nvidia is at the front end of another material leg, stronger than anticipated demand similar to, they say, to 23 and 24. Nvidia's market cap could run to $6 trillion, Julie. .Yeah. So obviously this is a very bullish call out from Loop Capital. By the way, Nvidia is there. It's at that record high. If it were going to close at this moment, it would be a new record close and it seems like it's pretty comfortably there here. So, um, Ananda Baru over there at Loop Capital, the latest to come in here, um, with this kind of $6 trillion math or these big trillion dollar numbers, um, that we've heard from other analysts as well. Basically, they're talking about the spending cycle that we are seeing from hyperscale and what they call AI factory companies, sovereign AI, for example, that they say gen AI and AI accelerated compute spending alone could get to $2 trillion by 2028 using current compute economics. So it's interesting to see that move in Nvidia. What I also think is interesting is that what we have seen, what we've been seeing in the other chips, not just Nvidia, uh, if you look at even the semiconductor ETF SMH here, it's up now about 12% year to date. It has outpaced software, it has outpaced internet, uh, tracked by other ETFs, IGB and FDN. This was flagged by Jordan Klein of Mizuho in a note this morning. And what he also flagged is it's not Nvidia that has taken the chips there. Yes, Nvidia has climbed a lot from its lows this year and is near that record high. But if you look at the best performers this year, it's some of the chip equipment makers like a KLA tencor and it's Micron, uh, which has done very well year to date, um, and since the lows. So, uh, it's interesting this again, I know I mentioned this earlier, the broadening. Yes, it's still Nvidia, but it's Nvidia and now when it comes to this chip and AI trade. .You know, it's interesting, Mark. I'm just reading Luke Capital here, saying Nvidia remains in their words, essentially, it's a monopoly for critical tech, and it has pricing and margin power. .Yeah, it continues to be probably the most important, uh, company within the semiconductor space, has achieved dramatic outperformance, uh, now set to make a new all time closing high. Uh, to Julie's point, look, we have seen some other important semiconductor companies also making remarkable headway, uh, from those April lows. Stocks like AMD, uh, Micron Technology, which we're expecting earnings from, of course, uh, later today. And so those are going to be really important. Semiconductors have snapped back, and that's been really, really important for tech. And I think it's generally a very bullish sign for, you know, the market as a whole.

2025-06-26 03:12:00,Shell denies reports of BP megamerger of Big Oil rivals,A Shell-BP deal would represent the biggest energy deal of the century—if not ever.,"Shell said “no talks are taking place” for a potential megamerger with rival BP that would cost more than $80 billion and represent the biggest energy deal of the century..The denial comes on the heels of the Wall Street Journal reporting June 25 that Shell is in early talks to acquire BP in a much-rumored deal. BP has struggled financially in recent years—dealing with investor activism from Elliott Investment Management and others and launching a “hard reset” in early 2025 that cuts costs, shifts away from renewables, and doubles down on fossil fuels..Shell and BP (ranked No. 13 and No. 25 on the Fortune Global 500, respectively) have the most natural crossover with their London headquarters and global footprint, and a combination, although expensive, could position Shell to better compete with U.S. giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron..With its stock down 17% in the past 12 months—and 25% in a decade—BP’s $82 billion market cap not only trails Exxon ($470 billion), Chevron ($250 billion), and Shell ($211 billion), but also France’s TotalEnergies ($140 billion) and Houston-based ConocoPhillips ($113 billion), bringing BP’s long-term viability into question..“This is further market speculation. No talks are taking place,” a Shell spokesperson said June 25. “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline, and simplification.”.In May, when asked about BP, Shell CEO Wael Sawan said the bar is set very high for any acquisitions, and that he was focused on using capital to boost share buybacks. Shell is undergoing its own more modest revamp reemphasizing oil and gas..BP declined comment on June 25, but its CEO, Murray Auchincloss, addressed a potential Shell deal in a recent sit-down interview with Fortune..“I can’t really say anything other than we’re focused on our own business, our strategy, and driving it forward. Obviously, the media likes to speculate about this. Investment bankers like to speculate about this,” Auchincloss said. “But we’re just focused on our own business right now. We’re happy to have launched the [reset] strategy, and we’re going to drive forward and grow cash flow, and that’ll make us strong and independent.”.The current record for oil and gas deals is the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil for more than $80 billion. A year prior, BP’s nearly $50 billion acquisition of Amoco set a short-lived record..But BP has dealt with significant struggles since, including the 2010 Deepwater Horizon tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico and, most recently, the 2020 strategy shift to rapidly grow renewables and cut oil and gas production 40% by 2030 as a bet that global oil demand was peaking.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-denies-reports-bp-megamerger-191214492.html,No risk.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, wrote that the companies were in ""early stage talks"" to merge, which powered more dramatic moves early in the session..A Shell spokesperson called the report ""speculation"" in emailed comments, saying that ""no talks are taking place."" Bloomberg in early May wrote that Shell was studying a possible deal..BP did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication..A deal would combine two massive oil companies.

The article claimed the FTSE 100 giant was open to the prospect of merging with Shell..It follows months of rumours that BP had become a target for rivals after losing ground, in large part because of its ill-fated pivot to net zero..BP’s defences have also been weakened by the impending exit of chairman Helge Lund, who is leaving next year under pressure from shareholders. Elliott, the hedge fund, is a major investor in BP and has been pushing the group to improve its performance..The United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company Adnoc reportedly examined a takeover of BP last year and has more recently been assessing a bid for assets, opening the door to a possible break-up of BP. Previous reports have also claimed that Shell was examining a potential takeover..An investor who owns shares in both BP and Shell said they would back a merger because it would create cost reductions for both groups..However, they said Shell would have to pay a premium of at least 30pc – implying a takeover price of about 480p per share, or £75bn – to win shareholder support..BP, led by chief executive Murray Auchincloss, is currently valued at £58bn. Shell is the larger of the two with a market cap of £152bn..“I don’t think this has come as a surprise. The genie is out of the bottle now on BP,” the investor said. “BP is an attractive asset for Shell because there’s a lot of synergies..“The market didn’t expect Shell to do it now because they still have cost-cutting plans, but they’re getting to the end of those. BP has been weak and with a low market cap, so there’s quite a lot of synergies.”.They added that another possible suitor for BP, American giant Chevron, was effectively ruled out of bidding for now because of litigation in the US about its takeover of Hess..This would make any Shell bid for BP easier because a major competitor could not launch a counter-offer for several months..Any deal would be hugely sensitive given BP is seen as a strategically important asset for the British state. It was majority-owned by the government until the 1980s and still enjoys close links.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-talks-acquire-bp-160549067.html,Merger Risk Regulatory Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk Operational Risk

On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR.” This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will!

Trump acknowledged that both Iran and Israel violated the ceasefire, telling a group of reporters that he is going to see if he can stop the ceasefire violations. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f— they’re doing,” he said..FED RATE SHOULD BE LOWER: On Monday night, President Donald Trump posted to Truth Social: “Too Late” Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate.

2025-06-25 18:30:00,Carnival Cruises Past Market Expectations in Boon for Shares,The choppy waters predicted for the cruise industry this year were based on the very real risks of trade wars and real wars.,"The world’s largest cruise company sailed well beyond Wall Street’s expectations in its latest quarter..Carnival raised its full year profit guidance on Tuesday as bookings appeared to show travellers are unwilling to let tariffs get between them and Tampa and they won’t allow geopolitics to close off their seaway to Greece..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.The choppy waters predicted for the cruise industry this year were based on the very real risks of trade wars and real wars, and all the economic disruption that one or both of those things would cause to travel demand. In late April, those worries seemed justified when Carnival competitor Norwegian Cruise Line missed Wall Street’s profit and revenue estimates when it reported its first quarter results and warned of cracks in the consumer spending hull..Cue Carnival’s results on Tuesday, which had investors smiling ear-to-eye like the sunkissed revelers on the deck of the 1,132-foot Jubilee as it pulls up to Cozumel. The company’s second quarter revenue of $6.3 billion was up 9% year-over-year, and net income of $565 million, up from $92 million in the same period last year, was $185 million better than the guidance it issued in March. Customer deposits were at a record $8.5 billion in the quarter, 2026 prices are at record highs and bookings are level with last year’s record pace. In a call with analysts, CEO Josh Weinstein offered some background on the good news:.April showers, in this case, brought a flowering of May bookings. Weinstein said travelers were hesitant to book in April after President Donald Trump announced a round of planned global tariffs, but demand returned in the weeks that followed, suggesting consumers are inclined to leave staycations back in the pandemic years..Carnival shares rose 6.9% on Tuesday, and the industry leader’s good news helped propel peers Norwegian up 4.3%, Royal Caribbean up 2.5%, and Viking up 3.4%. In the last year, Carnival shares have risen 56% thanks to strong consumer demand, and continued resilience coupled with a deescalation in the Middle East, which threatened to drive up fuel prices, buttressed its appeal on Wall Street..Wait and See: Weinstein said the Middle East conflict hasn’t impacted Carnival, but told analysts not to read too much into that yet: “While it has not yet had any discernible impact on our business, this is all unfolding too quickly in real time to try to project how it could impact our future business.” What could dent cruise industry revenues could be a new, much less heated geopolitical trend: port taxes. In recent months Alaska, Hawaii, Norway, and Mexico have all introduced levies on cruise ships or passengers, with cruise ship industry lobbies filing lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions in attempts to block them..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

That’s because they can be designed to target cancer cells and mostly spare healthy cells, something not afforded by conventional chemotherapy treatments that target all rapidly dividing cells, not just cancer cells (hence outcomes like hair loss)..Datroway was already approved for treating a form of breast cancer earlier this year, and AstraZeneca CEO Dave Fredrickson noted the approval “provides a much-needed option to patients with advanced EGFR-mutated lung cancer whose disease has become resistant to past treatments, regardless of the driving mutation.” The approval was, for a time, seen as something of a toss-up because of the results of one study, but AstraZeneca revised its filing to narrow its approval for only patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. For now, the approval breakthrough represents a small financial opportunity, but it opens the door to further payoffs:.JPMorgan analysts said Tuesday that the lung cancer approval for Datroway will “de-risk what we see as a $0.5 billion peak in-market sales opportunity.” The drug’s previous approval for breast cancer treatment, they said, had done the same for a “$0.4 billion peak in-market sales potential.”.Datroway’s next big test will be Phase III data from a study in triple-negative breast cancer that the company expects to have this quarter. JPMorgan views that as a $1 billion opportunity for sales. Later in 2025, there will be data on the treatment’s use for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients, which could open up considerably more opportunities..Extending the Cliff: AstraZeneca missed first-quarter revenue expectations when it reported in April, while a stronger-than-expected profit was not enough to offset concerns about weaker sales of core cancer and respiratory drugs. Like many other major pharma companies, it’s also facing a series of patent cliffs for key treatments like Farxiga, the diabetes drug that brought in $7.7 billion last year and currently faces a loss of US exclusivity. While Datroway won’t plug that hole on its own, the results are worth more than money in cases like these..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

While the first cargo is yet to be loaded, the milestone marks a significant breakthrough for Canada’s energy ambitions..The project which primarily targets Asia for its exports, comes amid rising concerns over global gas disruptions due to Israel-Iran conflict tensions in the Middle East..The facility is yet to load the first LNG export cargo but it is on schedule to do so by middle of 2025..The LNG Canada project is a joint venture comprising Shell (40%), Malaysia’s Petronas (25%), Mitsubishi Corporation (15%), PetroChina (15%) and Korea Gas Corporation (5%). It stands as the first large-scale LNG project in Canada to begin production and the first major LNG facility in North America with direct access to the Pacific Coast, offering a faster shipping route to Asia’s markets compared with terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to export 14 million metric tons of LNG annually. Shell and its partners are also planning to make a final investment decision next year to potentially double this capacity..With LNG Canada online, Canada is poised to divert a portion of natural gas exports away from the United States, currently its sole international customer. In 2024, Canada piped around 8.6 billion cubic feet per day to the United States, but traders anticipate a dip as new LNG routes come into play. Two more projects, Woodfibre LNG and Cedar LNG, are also under construction, aiming for completion between 2027 and 2028..With the Gaslog Glasgow tanker approaching Kitimat for its maiden LNG load, the stage is set for Canada’s emergence as a key Pacific exporter. For a country long reliant on U.S. pipelines, the launch of LNG Canada reshapes its energy future, unlocking access to global markets and fortifying energy security at a time of global uncertainty..London-based Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors, a group of U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.

Trump posted on social media last week that he wants it on his desk “ASAP – NO DELAYS.” He said the bill will “make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets.”.As businesses eye the new legislation, they’re exploring how they can ride the hype:.Some of the largest US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, are considering teaming up to launch a joint stablecoin, according to The Wall Street Journal. For now, JPMorgan said it’s launching a stablecoin-like “deposit token” called JPMD on Coinbase’s blockchain..Walmart, Amazon and Expedia are reportedly exploring the launch of their own stablecoins, which could enable shoppers to bypass traditional payment platforms and pay through the blockchain..If You Can’t Beat ’Em: Stablecoins pose an existential threat to traditional finance because they let consumers bypass banks, instead processing transactions on the blockchain. So TradFi (crypto-speak for Traditional Finance) companies are getting ahead of the trend with their own platforms and stablecoins, ensuring they’ll still be a part of people’s purchases, even if they move to the blockchain. Proponents also say stablecoins make transactions faster and cheaper, but skeptics remain concerned about security and possible regulatory complications..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

2025-06-24 12:01:00,Novo Nordisk Backs Away From Hims & Hers Partnership,Novo and Hims’ April team-up turned the two firms from competitors into collaborators at just the right moment.,"In a fitting twist for a company called Hims & Hers, the latest drama in the weight-loss drug world has become a classic “he said, she said” tale of alleged corporate misdeeds..On one side is Novo Nordisk, which on Monday announced it was backing out of its partnership to sell Wegovy at a discounted price to Hims & Hers, accusing the company of selling too many knockoff versions of the drug in violation of their agreement. On the other side, Hims & Hers, which says it was operating within the terms of the deal and called the claims “misleading.”.READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Novo and Hims’ April team-up turned the two firms from competitors into collaborators at just the right moment. Two months prior, the US Food and Drug Administration removed the key ingredient of Wegovy, semaglutide, from its shortage list. That effectively put an end to Hims’ newfound (and lucrative) business of selling knockoff compounded versions of the drug to its telehealth customers. Sales of the copycats took a bite out of Novo’s business while the company was already losing market share to archrival Eli Lilly. Which is why the partnership made sense at first: Novo wanted an easier way to sell its weight-loss drugs, and Hims wanted to keep selling weight-loss drugs..But the relationship came with strings attached. Namely, according to Novo, Hims was supposed to pare back its copycat drugs business — though the exact terms may have been a little loose:.According to FDA rules, Hims technically can still sell its knockoff weight loss drugs to patients who require “personalized dosages,” and in April, the telehealth firm said it would continue to do so..Novo, however, said on Monday that the telehealth firm is continuing “mass sales” of the compounded version in violation of both their partnership agreement and possibly the law. Novo also accused Hims of “disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk.”.For its part, Hims said in a statement Monday that Novo pressured the company to “steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients” and that the company refuses “to be strong-armed” and will continue to offer “a range of treatments, including Wegovy.”.Without a Captain: The falling out is the latest challenge for Novo. In the US, weekly prescription fill-ups for Wegovy have recently trailed Eli Lilly’s rival treatment, Zepbound, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Eli Lilly’s diabetes treatment Mounjaro, meanwhile, is closing the gap on Novo’s Ozempic. Worse, Lilly’s R&D pipeline is looking far more promising after it reported successful clinical trials for a pill version of its weight-loss drug, which many expect to juice the so-far injectables-only industry. Novo’s pipeline, meanwhile, took a hit after it reported disappointing trial results for its next-gen weight-loss drug CagriSema in December. The Danish company’s woes ultimately led to the ouster of CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in May. He hasn’t yet been replaced..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

At first glance, the events seemed like a recipe for oil prices to surge and stock markets to falter..Instead, a day of diplomatic jockeying led to relative calm for investors. Defense officials signaled the prevailing mood was one of compromise and, in the evening, President Donald Trump announced Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. While that ceasefire was tested overnight, investors around the world are in agreement that de-escalation remains the most likely outcome..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.If Trump’s sudden ceasefire announcement was unexpected, the desire to de-escalate was not. US officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized on Sunday that the US strikes on Iran were “not open-ended” and “not about regime change.”.When Iran responded to the US action a day later, its diplomats even reached out to US officials through diplomatic channels to relay a courtesy heads-up before firing at an American airbase, Reuters reported. They coordinated with Qatari officials, too, The New York Times reported, in order to minimize casualties. Qatar was able to shoot down the missiles with its air defenses, and there were no injuries or deaths. Markets read these actions as a signal that Tehran likewise preferred not to escalate. President Trump even publicly thanked Iran for the advance notice. Markets in the world’s two largest economies, which have a significant interest in the stability of the oil-producing Middle East, have so far taken it in stride:.The West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark fell over 8% to $67.48 a barrel on Monday, its biggest drop in a day since early April and the first time it has traded below $70 since June 12, the day before Israel’s first strikes on Iran’s nuclear program. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all rose just under 1% in a collective sigh of relief — as of early Tuesday morning, futures tied to the Dow were up 0.8%, futures attached to the S&P 500 were up 0.9% and futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq had risen 1.2%..With heightened escalation that would imperil both oil markets and investor confidence seemingly averted, investors in China — which buys roughly 90% of all Iranian crude oil, according to data firm Kpler — registered their relief Tuesday.

The company’s top line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. A strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence, growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are key positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus. The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to increase 8.5% from 2024. However, Amazon announced mixed guidance for the second quarter. High tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods imported from China have cast uncertainty on retailers such as Amazon. AMZN's free cash flow has decreased significantly.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Home Depot’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (+2.2% vs. -2.5%). The company’s performance is supported by strong execution across key growth initiatives. Home Depot continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings. These factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects. However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates. Margin pressure, currency headwinds, and macroeconomic uncertainty also remain key risks.

Its Splunk acquisition enhances the recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio. However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition.

Despite this, shares trade at deep discounts, suggesting an upside if execution improves.Nevertheless, United Homes is executing a strategic transformation focused on margin expansion and operational efficiency. A shift toward refreshed home designs, now yielding 24% gross margins, supports profitability and reduces reliance on discounting. UHG’s pre-sale strategy improves margin visibility and working capital efficiency while rebidding efforts and faster build cycles enhances cost control. Though volume and margin remain under pressure amid soft demand, UHG is expanding into high-growth Southeastern markets, with a land-light model supporting disciplined capital returns.

Valuation remains attractive at 0.62X EV/S and 6.88X EV/EBITDA versus peers. Nevertheless, Eastern Company’s performance is driven by Velvac’s market share gains and operational enhancements in the Class 8 truck segment, including vertical integration and aftermarket expansion. Despite industry softness, Eastern sustains profitability, posting Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and net income of $2 million, with a gross margin of 22.4%. A leaner balance sheet and improved working capital reinforce financial flexibility.

If the closure happens, it would be unprecedented and likely have profound consequences for the global economy and energy supply..Here's everything you need to know:.Around a fifth of the world’s oil consumption flows through the Strait of Hormuz. It is the entry and exit point to the Persian Gulf and a cornerstone for the energy market, with around 30% of the world's liquified natural gas sourced there, too..In May, approximately 17.8 million to 20.8 million barrels of crude, condensate, and fuels flowed through the strait daily, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa..Saudi Arabia uses it to export around 6 million barrels of crude oil per day, more than any neighbouring country..Meanwhile, Iran exports about 1.7 million barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency..Read more: LIVE: Wall Street wavers, European stocks fall as investors await Iran's response to US strikes.Iran exported $67bn (£49.8bn) worth of oil in the financial year ending March 2025 — its highest oil revenue in the past decade — according to estimates by the Central Bank of Iran..The majority of exports are sent to Asia. China alone is estimated to buy around 90% of the oil that Iran exports to the global market..However, the economic inflationary shocks of any closure could be felt globally, with increased energy prices rippling into the real economy..If the Strait is closed by Iran's national security council, the country will have to decide how to close the stretch of water..To the north of the passage is Iran, and to the south is the UAE and Oman. It's about 33km wide at its narrowest point and 50km at its entrance and exit. UN rules allow countries to exercise control up to 12 nautical miles (13.8 miles) from their coastline..So far, Israel's military and US attacks have been focused on Iran's nuclear programme and other targets, instead of its naval assets..According to reports and analysis, Iran's navy could move to lay out a number of mines in the sea via fast attack boats and submarines to protect the closed Strait on the country's southern border and stop ships passing into the Persian Gulf.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iran-israel-strait-of-hormuz-closure-oil-prices-144323313.html,Geopolitical Risk Market Risk Supply Chain Risk Commodity Price Risk Economic Risk 
2025-06-23 21:10:00,What Makes Chevron's Gulf of America Oil Bet So Compelling,"CVX eyes a significant output boost from the Gulf of America by 2026, driven by new deepwater projects like Ballymore and Whale.","Chevron Corporation CVX is leaning heavily on the Gulf of America (GOA) to fuel its next wave of production growth. In April 2025, the company brought first oil online at Ballymore, a key asset expected to produce around 75,000 barrels per day once all three initial wells ramp up. Just months earlier, production began at Whale — another major deepwater project designed for 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) at peak. With multiple phases still ahead, these developments represent the core of Chevron’s plan to reach 300,000 net BOE/d from the GOA by 2026 — a 50% jump from the 2020 levels.Behind the numbers is a broader strategic shift. Chevron is combining decades of operational experience with new technologies to unlock deepwater resources more efficiently. Whale, for example, leverages a simplified facility design and energy-efficient systems to reduce emissions and cost per barrel. Similarly, the high-pressure Anchor platform — operational since August 2024 — is built to handle extreme conditions, with a resource base estimated at 440 million barrels of oil-equivalent. Together, these assets represent some of Chevron’s highest-margin, lowest-carbon barrels globally.This push isn’t just about drilling more — it’s about drilling smarter. Chevron’s updated project models are helping it reduce costs, increase efficiency, and extend the life of its fields. For instance, the Tahiti platform, which has been producing since 2009, has since crossed 500 million barrels and could continue operating into the 2040s. Backed by more efficient designs and low-carbon intensity output, Chevron’s Gulf operations are positioned to remain a strong, high-margin part of its portfolio..Europe’s largest energy major Shell plc SHEL is the largest operator in the GoA, known for pioneering deepwater oil and gas production. Its operations — like Perdido, Vito, Whale, and the upcoming Sparta — showcase advanced, cost-efficient technology. With lower-than-average emissions and a 40% cut in methane since 2016, Shell is pairing innovation with sustainability in one of the world’s most challenging offshore environments. Shell continues to lead with standardized designs, robotics and efficient subsea systems, keeping safety and environmental performance at the core of its offshore strategy.Continental rival BP plc BP is also one of the top oil producers in the GoA, operating major hubs, including Atlantis, Mad Dog and Thunder Horse. With $7 billion in investments through 2025, BP aims to exceed 400,000 BOE/d in production from the region by the end of the decade. BP is also unlocking deep resources through projects like Kaskida, using smart, replicable platform designs for future expansion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-chevrons-gulf-america-oil-131000439.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk Environmental Risk Regulatory Risk

It’s the catch-all to describe everything from the fog of trade to nonstop geopolitical tensions..The inherent uncertainty of uncertainty also makes it hard to put a price tag on its impact, but last week, accounting firm PwC offered up a number: $1 trillion.

You know the deal: President Trump has focused on other priorities to start his second term, and the resulting market limbo has put deals on hold. According to PwC analysts, plans for initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies worth a combined $120 billion were shelved in the first three weeks of April..The Federal Reserve’s decision to hold off on rate cuts to wait for the potential impacts of tariffs has had a resulting domino effect: a lack of cheap debt, as higher interest rates make debt more expensive. PwC noted that 30% of the $3 trillion that private equity firms have invested in roughly 30,000 companies has been held for more than five years, an unusually long period compared with the typical timetable for PE shops to turn a profit on an investment. This, they surmised, is in part because they have been less able to finance growing companies without cheap debt. “In a typical M&A cycle, $1 trillion would have already been put back into the market,” Josh Smigel, a PwC partner, said on a media call. The data, meanwhile, looks like a set of spinning wheels:.Deal volume and value have been more or less flat year-over-year, PwC said, with roughly 4,500 deals worth a total of $567 billion through May..In response to PwC’s May Pulse Survey, 30% of respondents said they have paused or revisited deals because of tariff concerns, which would delay investor returns. “While nearly half (48%) of the business executives surveyed expect today’s uncertainty to last less than a year, many anticipate it could extend through the next presidential election,” reads the report..May Change Your Mind? With the possibility that the worst of the tariff warring is over, May data provides a more optimistic scenario.

Not to mention, its stock offers a relatively unfiltered view of investor confidence in the sector..But while the company has risen nearly 9% so far this year, and some analysts are gung ho, a look under the hood suggests that astronomical growth can’t carry on forever, even if geopolitics feels like a dice roll in a game of Risk at the moment..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Back in January, almost 60% of organizations including private companies told the World Economic Forum that geopolitical tensions have impacted their cybersecurity strategies. Many are also on edge about risks: One in three CEOs said they were worried about losing sensitive information or intellectual property to cyber-espionage, and 45% of cyber leaders expressed concern about operational and business disruptions. The rise of state-sanctioned cyberattacks, with China and Russia the best-known sponsors, and recent warnings to US companies to prep for potential cyberattacks from Iran have inflamed tensions..All that suggests a market for Palo Alto Networks to grow into, what with its next-generation firewalls, cloud security services and AI-powered security operations. Goldman Sachs analysts are among those who see this logic: They maintained a buy rating on the company earlier this month, citing its revenue growth of roughly 14% in the past 12 months and its success in selling new products to existing customers. But, on the other hand, there’s a maturity challenge:.Palo Alto Networks sales growth has slowed — its revenue growth was in the mid-20s percentage points in 2023, and its latest quarter saw revenues grow 15.7% year over year. Meanwhile, the growth of annual recurring revenue — which offers a glimpse into the company’s ability to retain customers — has declined in five straight quarters, and it’s expected to be around 32% this year, compared with 45% or more in previous years..Even as Palo Alto beat revenue and earnings expectations in its latest quarter, the slowdown suggests the company may be maturing and reaching a plateau where customer adoption is slowing —a reality that cybersecurity firms will have to learn to live with, as other industries have. Nevertheless, the sector is expected to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade, meaning there will be plenty of dollars to compete for, but likely more competitors. Palo Alto, at the very least, proved more resilient during a week of concerns about conflict with Iran than the broader tech industry.

In a...,"What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Shell's (LON:SHEL) returns on capital, so let's have a look..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Shell is:.Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities).0.11 = US$33b ÷ (US$389b - US$96b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025)..Thus, Shell has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.8% generated by the Oil and Gas industry.. View our latest analysis for Shell .Above you can see how the current ROCE for Shell compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Shell ..Shell's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 116% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward..As discussed above, Shell appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a staggering 148% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue..One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Shell and understanding this should be part of your investment process.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-no-shortage-growth-recently-075928174.html,No risk.

But after the Oracle of Omaha prophesied his own future, his company’s momentum shifted to reverse gear..Even with the endorsement of Buffett and the expectation that Abel will maintain Berkshire’s culture and value-oriented investment strategy, investors have yet to see that Buffett’s successor is capable of buying big, concentrated blocks of stock in companies like American Express, Apple, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola at precisely the right time. Berkshire also has another major succession in order, as the mastermind of its juggernaut insurance business, Ajit Jain, said he offered the company a shortlist of successors last year. But while there’s no doubt the transition has contributed to the selloff, there’s also the matter of simple performance:.Berkshire’s operating earnings fell 14% in the first quarter to $9.6 billion. And despite saying for years that he is hunting for an “elephant-sized” acquisition, Buffett hasn’t found one. The company is sitting on a record cash reserve close to $350 billion and has also been a net seller of stocks for 10 consecutive quarters..Berkshire is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6 times its estimated future earnings this year, or a slight premium over the S&P 500. That suggests there may still be room to fall and a handful of analysts have predicted more selling, but Berkshire’s massive cash hoard could end up positioning the company well if there is an economic downturn that would allow it to go bargain-hunting.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-slips-amid-concern-retiring-103000302.html,Market Risk Succession Risk Reputational Risk

According to a report in The Wall Street Journal last week, OpenAI is now even considering a “nuclear option” to sever ties for good..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.At the heart of the matter is how large a stake Microsoft will own in OpenAI’s public benefit corporation, a subsidiary of the ChatGPT maker that will still be controlled by the nonprofit parent. According to a recent Reuters report, OpenAI wants the Big Tech player to hold a 33% stake while relinquishing its rights to future profits. Microsoft hasn’t agreed, and the two sides are at loggerheads over the matter, though it’s far from their first fight..Microsoft already loosened its grip on the AI firm in January, allowing some key terms of their agreement to change so that OpenAI could tap data centers outside of the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. That resulted in “Stargate,” a high-profile $500 million data center joint venture between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle (with Microsoft, Nvidia, and Arm serving as “technology partners”). But opening the door to more independence may be objectionable to Microsoft: Earlier this month, Reuters reported OpenAI is now planning to tap Google’s cloud services to meet its growing need for computing capacity. In another line-crossing move, The Information reported last week that OpenAI has been offering a suite of ChatGPT enterprise tools at discounts of up to 20%, directly undercutting sales of competing Microsoft services like Copilot..In other words, tensions are at an all-time high, and now both sides are throwing around fighting words at a time when level-headed communication is crucial:.According to the WSJ, OpenAI executives have discussed a “nuclear option” of formally accusing Microsoft of antitrust violations if it can’t come to an agreement with the Windows-maker over transition terms..According to a Financial Times report published Wednesday, Microsoft is prepared to walk away from negotiations altogether and simply ride out its existing commercial contract with OpenAI, which is set to last until 2030. That would leave OpenAI stuck with its current structure, which means it’d lose out on half of the $40 billion investment SoftBank committed to making in April, which was contingent on a successful restructuring to for-profit by the end of the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-careens-toward-messy-divorce-103000468.html,Operational Risk Strategic Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk

But the decline will be very slow and gradual and will look more like a plateau than a downward spiral..The world’s biggest international oil and gas companies have started to acknowledge that demand growth could slow or stop within a decade. But these firms keep pumping oil and gas more than they did earlier this decade as they expect that oil demand – regardless of a peak – isn’t going anywhere..Big Oil’s Big Pivot .Despite the headline-grabbing surge in renewable energy capacity, solar and wind cannot replace fossil fuels in many industrial processes and production while demand for petrochemicals drives increased oil and gas consumption..The strategic shift of BP and Shell from early this decade to boost investments in renewables while scaling back oil production lasted only a couple of years. Europe’s Big Oil found out firsthand that the renewables business isn’t bringing the profits that the core oil and gas business is generating. Faced with the difficult task of rewarding shareholders with attractive yields and payouts and stopping the investor outflow from the industry, and with an energy crisis with soaring oil and gas prices, Shell and BP drastically scaled on their ambitions in renewables and shifted their focus on oil and gas again..Equinor of Norway, where electric vehicles hold an enormous market share and power comes from hydro and wind, also reduced investments in renewables, in order to boost returns for shareholders and adapt to an uneven energy transition. The Norwegian major, which dropped ‘oil’ from its name and rebranded to Equinor seven years ago with more renewables business in mind, acknowledged that market conditions in the clean energy sector have changed and the energy transition is going forward with an uncertain and uneven pace. At the same time, Equinor, which now produces a large part of the gas going to Europe via pipelines, expects to keep a high level of oil and gas production in Norway “all the way to 2035.”.“What we are working on is to make sure that we are able to squeeze every molecule out of the Norwegian continental shelf,” chief executive Anders Opedal told the Financial Times..“So we have to drill around 100 wells a year for the next decade.”.Low returns from higher-cost renewables and the uncertain pace of the transition amid the push for security of supply have had European majors scale back plans and investments in renewables and look to grow low-cost lower-carbon oil and gas production.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-big-oil-isn-t-000000475.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Reputational Risk

The announcement was made following a meeting between Malaysia’s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, and Shell CEO Wael Sawan. Ibrahim has described this as a significant step forward for Malaysia’s economy. The investment is expected to enhance Shell’s operations in the country and create high-skilled employment opportunities..Malaysia’s prime minister underlined that Shell's choice is a clear endorsement of the country's leadership, economic direction and clarity of policy. Though details of specific projects remain undisclosed, the RM9 billion figure represents one of the most substantial foreign investment commitments made in recent times. The investment also demonstrates Malaysia’s ability to attract continued interest from leading multinational corporations, particularly in the vital Oils-Energy sector..The funding commitment reinforces Shell’s long-standing relationship with Malaysia, where it has been active for decades. This new phase of investment indicates a deeper strategic alignment and a reaffirmation of Malaysia’s role in Shell’s regional growth plans. While Shell has not released an official statement or elaborated on the development roadmap, the investment signals a renewed focus on expanding its footprint within the country..A central outcome of the investment, as highlighted by prime minister of Malaysia, is the expected creation of high-skilled job opportunities for the citizens. This aligns with broader national objectives to move toward a more technologically advanced, skills-based economy. Although further information regarding the nature of these roles and the industries they will impact has not been made available, the initiative is positioned as a long-term driver of workforce development..While Shell continues to deepen the commitment to Malaysia, it is also carefully managing broader geopolitical risks that could impact global energy markets. Sawan recently noted heightened caution around Shell’s shipping operations in the Middle East amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.

After multiple years of a clear-cut seller’s market effectively pummeling prospective buyers into resignation, the worm is beginning to turn. The result? The housing supply seems to finally be outstripping demand. Sellers are outnumbering buyers by nearly half a million, according to a RedFin report published in May. And Wednesday’s figures from the Census Bureau all but confirm the trend: The inventory of completed houses now stands at the highest level since 2009. It proved sufficient to push housing starts down to 1.26 million on an annualized basis, significantly lower than the 1.39 million in April. And it’s probably not going to turn around anytime soon: The number of building permits issued — an indicator of construction to come — also fell to a five-year low in May..Still, over-inventory isn’t the sole reason for the slowdown. The cost of building materials has surged amid the White House’s trade war, while a spike in immigrant deportations has intensified a construction labor shortage, Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told MarketWatch on Wednesday..It’s enough to keep tipping the scales in buyers’ favor — though we’re not quite at a buyer’s paradise just yet:.37% of home builders reported cutting prices to boost sales in June, according to a survey released Tuesday from the National Association of Home Builders. That marks the highest proportion since at least 2022..However, the same report showed that builder sentiment has fallen to its lowest level since 2022 and the third-lowest level since 2012 — largely because builders don’t see a buyer’s market materializing, thanks mainly to elevated mortgage rates.

That’s when these blank-check companies, which list on public markets in order to later merge with a target company and take it public, were all the rage. There was a time when it felt like there were as many celebrity SPACs  — Martha Stewart, Jay-Z and Shaquille O’Neal each got in on the craze — as there are celebrity tequila brands..Roughly 600 SPAC deals in 2021 raised a record $163 billion. But a year later, the market froze after interest rates were hiked and the S&P 500 turned in its worst year since the late-2000s financial crisis, falling 19% in 2022. The value of many companies that went public during the SPAC craze crashed, too. They were not helped by the Securities and Exchange Commission stepping in to protect investors. The regulator introduced rules in 2022, finalized two years later, that aligned SPAC disclosure and conflict of interest requirements more closely with the rigorous standards of traditional IPOs. But this year, finally, has marked a mini-comeback of sorts, thanks to maybe the biggest celebrity SPAC figure of all:.That, of course, would be President Trump, whose Truth Social went public via SPAC merger in 2022. The expectation that Trump and Paul Atkins, his pick for SEC chair, would focus more on capital formation than clampdown has sparked a return to the vehicles: According to SPACInsider data, there have been 58 SPAC offerings so far this year, one more than the total in all of 2024..In fact, the most active bank on SPAC deals this year, Cantor Fitzgerald, has deep ties to the Trump administration: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is its former CEO and upon taking his job in Trump’s Cabinet, he handed control to his sons Brandon and Kyle.

2025-06-19 23:25:00,Why forecasters can’t agree on when oil demand will peak,"Oil demand is proving more resilient than expected, with forecasts suggesting a plateau rather than a sharp decline.","Oil demand is set to plateau rather than drop off a cliff after it peaks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted this week, citing “policy settings and market trends.” But here’s the thing about policy settings and market trends: they change..That oil demand is set to peak before 2030 has been repeated ad nauseam by various forecasters, including, notably, Chinese energy majors Sinopec and CNPC. Indeed, OPEC is the only forecaster of demand that does not see it peaking anytime soon. Of course, OPEC is interested in its predictions panning out—but so is the IEA, a vocal proponent of the shift to electrification in transport and moving from hydrocarbon-fueled baseload generation to weather-dependent wind and solar, as are many governments of large oil consumers..When the IEA cited those “policy settings and market trends” in its latest Oil Market Report and its Oil 2025 report, which came out together this week, it was that shift to EVs and the move to wind and solar that it meant as drivers of falling oil demand. But there are some challenges facing both assumptions..A recent Shell-commissioned survey found that while existing EV owners tend to feel more confident about their vehicles, many prospective buyers remain hesitant—citing cost as a major barrier. “While current EV drivers are feeling more confident, the relatively high cost of owning an electric vehicle, combined with broader economic pressures, are making it a difficult decision for new consumers,” Shell’s VP for mobility and convenience, David Bunch, said, as quoted by Bloomberg this week..China remains an exception, thanks to extensive subsidies and a highly competitive market that has driven down prices. However, even in China, this model may be reaching its limits. “It’s very extreme, tough competition,” an executive vice president of BYD (BYDDF, 1211.HK) told Bloomberg. “No, it’s not sustainable,” Stella Li added, referring to the current situation in China’s electric car sector. The most likely prospect is consolidation. And that may put a stop to the continuous decline in prices..Despite this, many oil demand forecasts—including the IEA’s—still rely on projections of steady EV growth. But recent industry decisions suggest a more complex picture. GM (GM) announced it would invest $4 billion in expanding internal combustion engine vehicle production.

BP ranks eighth, with a market cap of nearly £62bn. Their large weightings mean that movements in their share prices have a greater impact on driving the FTSE 100 higher..Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, noted stock market gains were “driven by the energy sector” in the beginning of the week..The FTSE 100 notched another 8,902.34 on Monday on the back of oil company performance..Shell and BP had a bumpy first-quarter after crude oil prices weakened amid geopolitical uncertainty..Adjusted earnings dropped to $5.58bn (£4.2bn) at Shell, down from $7.73bn in the same period in 2024. Meanwhile, weakened oil prices led to BP slashing its buyback to $750m, compared to $1.75bn in the previous quarter..This followed the cost of a barrel of Brent crude sinking below $70 in the fallout of Trump’s levies..Shell was reported to be weighing a takeover bid for BP earlier this year, after the latter’s share price plummeted over 30 per cent in 12 months..BP has suffered a huge rebellion from its shareholders at its annual general meeting in April, as shareholders lashed out at its environmental retreat..By City AM.More Top Reads From Oilprice.com.U.S. Battery Makers Declare National Emergency After China’s Antimony Ban.Woodside Energy and Petronas Forge 15-Year LNG Supply Deal.Iran Is Rushing To Export Oil Following Israeli Attacks.Read this article on OilPrice.com",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-bp-climb-middle-east-140000773.html,Geopolitical Risk Market Risk Commodity Price Risk

With no immediate end in sight, analysts are weighing multiple possibilities that could affect prices down the line..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Even with US sanctions, Iran remains the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), pumping 3.3 million barrels of crude oil daily and exporting 1.7 million of them. ING analysts said last week that losing this export supply would be enough to erase a global oil market surplus forecast for this year — in March, the International Energy Agency predicted a roughly 600,000 barrels-per-day oversupply for 2025. That surplus, they forecast, would have led to prices trending lower in 2026. Without it, Brent crude prices could climb as high as $80 a barrel, though they will more probably settle at $75. (Brent crude futures closed at $76.45 a barrel on Tuesday, up 4.4%, and US West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $74.84 a barrel, up 4.3%.).Whether oil prices remain elevated long-term depends entirely on how the conflict plays out or whether it continues (the Trump administration has offered mixed messages about its desire to broker peace). Both sides have targeted energy infrastructure: Iran, for example, had to temporarily pause some operations at the South Pars field, the world’s largest gas field, after it was hit by an Israeli air strike on Saturday. ING’s analysts noted that further targeting of upstream assets would have a greater impact on the global oil market by crunching the export supply. But there’s an even more acute risk:.An extended conflict could disrupt shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and thus one of the most strategically important maritime passages on Earth. Nearly a third of the world’s seaborne oil is funneled through the channel, which is a mere 29 nautical miles wide at its narrowest point..ING’s analysts calculated that 14 million barrels of oil supply per day might be at risk. In a worse scenario, they wrote, a major disruption in the strait might drive Brent crude prices up to a whopping $120 a barrel by the end of the year, well above the $147.50 high set during the 2008 financial crisis.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-spike-israel-iran-103000315.html,Geopolitical Risk Market Risk Supply Chain Risk

According to a separate report from Bloomberg, the fundraising comes as the company continues to burn through a remarkable amount of cash every month..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Training and operating AI models is expensive. Like, very expensive. According to one estimate from tech pundit Ed Zitron, OpenAI’s total costs may exceed $25 billion this year alone. Carlyle Group CEO Harvey Schwartz recently predicted in a shareholder letter that the industry as a whole will shell out some $1.8 trillion by 2030 to build out AI infrastructure..xAI is no different than its peers (and, in fact, may be burning through cash even faster than its peers in an attempt to catch up). Unlike OpenAI and industry frontrunners, the Grok chatbot operator has hardly established a revenue stream to offset its rapid burn rate:.xAI has been burning through $1 billion per month to build its advanced AI models and expects to spend $13 billion this year alone. The company has raised $14 billion in equity fundraising since its launch in 2023, though as of March 31, it had only $4 billion left on its balance sheet, according to materials seen by Bloomberg..On the flip side, the company expects just $500 million in revenue this year. Comparatively, OpenAI recently claimed to have hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, driven in part by 3 million paying business users..X Marks The Spot: Still, xAI does expect the tables to turn eventually. That’s based partly on the hope that its recent merger with fellow Musk venture X (formerly known as Twitter) could prove to be a fruitful partnership.

(""Shell"") to integrate and further develop technologies for utilizing robots and drones in plant monitoring and maintenance. Under the agreement, Yokogawa will add an advanced machine vision tool called Operator Round by Exception (ORE), developed by Shell, into its own OpreX™ Robot Management Core. The enhanced software service will be made available by Yokogawa to customers in the energy, chemicals, and other industries..ORE is a digital solution that uses machine vision and AI analytics to enable robots to autonomously perform a number of tasks in the operator round process, such as reading gauges and checking for leaks and machinery issues. It is the result of a two-year collaborative effort within Shell, which combined machine vision strategy with deep capabilities in the field of integrity management, remote site inspection, and corrosion management..OpreX Robot Management Core is a key product in Yokogawa’s robot solutions. The software helps customers maintain their facilities in a safer and more efficient manner by integrating the management of various types of robots that perform plant maintenance tasks conventionally carried out by humans. When connected to a plant’s control and safety systems, the data acquired can be used to issue instructions to robots, thus enabling the first step to be taken toward autonomous plant operations. The addition of Shell’s ORE technology will significantly increase the number of use cases available to customers through OpreX Robot Management Core..Moving forward, Yokogawa robotics operations will deploy at two Shell facilities as a pilot into how robotics and drones can deliver value through efficiencies in plant monitoring and maintenance..This collaboration is the first key milestone for Yokogawa working alongside Shell in the collaboration space at the Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam, which was created by Shell in 2022 to provide a platform for collaboration between companies, societal organisations, governments, and universities to work on tomorrow’s energy solutions. Shell and Yokogawa have also agreed to collaborate on an aligned R&D roadmap to further develop and enhance the machine vision technology, ensuring continuous innovation and improvement.

2025-06-17 18:30:00,US Flexes Golden Share in Nippon Merger With US Steel,The deal is the Trump administration’s attempt to stake out a new path for balancing national security and the influx of foreign capital.,"A year-and-a-half wait tested its mettle, but Nippon Steel finally got its $14.9 billion deal..On Monday, days after the US government signed off on the Japanese firm’s contentious acquisition of stateside competitor US Steel, Trump administration officials disclosed initial details of a special “gold” share that gives Washington extraordinary powers over the combined operation’s future..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.The deal is heavy even by metal standards — it’s the Trump administration’s attempt to stake out a new path for balancing national security and the influx of foreign capital. Nippon Steel had been trying to close the purchase of US Steel since December 2023. The Biden administration halted it over national security concerns and an 18-month purgatory followed. Meanwhile, the already struggling US Steel endured significant headwinds while in the holding pattern, including a drop in annual net earnings to $384 million last year from $895 million in 2023, which was compounded by weak demand for steel due to global oversupply. The culprit? China increasing exports as its real estate sector sputtered..The transaction finally moved ahead after Nippon pledged billions in investments and the Trump administration secured a guarantee that the US government would hold a single share of preferred stock, dubbed class G for “gold,” in the combined entity. That share affords close to a dozen extraordinary powers, which Nippon wanted to end after three or four years. But Trump officials dug their heels in and, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick tweeted Saturday, the “gold” share’s powers will exist in perpetuity. Initial details have left markets pricing US Steel right where Nippon’s offer landed in 2023:.Under the national security agreement Nippon and US Steel signed on Friday, the “gold” share will allow the US government to block the combined company from delaying or reducing $14 billion in promised investments, moving production or jobs abroad and closing or idling plants before certain timeframes. The US will also appoint a board member handpicked by the sitting president and have the right to veto any move to relocate US Steel’s headquarters out of Pittsburgh or to change its name. Lutnick said it will also have controls over “employee salaries, anti-dumping pricing, raw materials and sourcing outside the US, acquisitions and more.”.US Steel shares rose 5.1% on Monday and, at $54.85, closed mere pennies away from Nippon’s $55-per-share offer. They have gained 61% this year, climbing dramatically late last month after the Trump administration began telegraphing that it expected a deal. That suggests a significant amount of gains around the deal are already priced in.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-flexes-golden-share-nippon-103000272.html,Political Risk Legal Risk Regulatory Risk Economic Risk

For key US players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, the show comes at a critical moment..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Both Archer and Joby went public in 2020 during the SPAC craze. Like a lot of SPAC companies, their appeal to investors was largely speculative — and, five years later, remains somewhat speculative (neither has completed a commercial flight yet). But promises of a Jetsons-esque future of battery-powered flying taxis are starting to look a little more real, especially after a slew of developments in just the past couple of weeks..At the end of May, Joby announced it received $250 million from Toyota, the second tranche of a $500 million investment from the major automaker announced in October (which itself followed a previous $394 million investment from Toyota). Then, last week, came the big news: As part of a broader initiative to promote domestic drone production, the White House issued an executive order to launch a pilot program for the nascent industry..The announcement brought renewed interest to the pair of eVTOL firms, which showed both companies may have climbed a little too close to the sun:.Shares of Joby had spiked more than 30% in the days immediately following the announcement of the Toyota cash infusion. That led analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald to quell some of the excitement, downgrading the stock from overweight to neutral while highlighting the company’s high cash-burn rate and lack of near-term upside..Archer, meanwhile, seized the opportunity presented by the White House’s encouraging executive orders to sell $850 million of stock on Friday, which dragged its share price down 15%. It did recover nearly 4% on Monday, however..Cleared for Takeoff: But what about the question that may matter the most: When will these birds finally fly? It’s tough to say. Both companies have scored deals to launch air taxi services in the United Arab Emirates, with Archer saying industry standards in the country should be finalized by next month and Joby saying service could start as soon as early next year. Both companies have also struck deals with major US airlines — Archer with United and Joby with Delta — to eventually ferry passengers to and from major US airports. Archer has also struck a deal to become the official air taxi partner of the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which shows the lengths to which Angelenos will go to avoid their infamous traffic jams..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

2025-06-16 18:30:00,Act of GENIUS or Blockheaded Bill? Congress Considers Stablecoins,The Senate is set to vote this week on a bill that would introduce the first-ever regulatory framework for stablecoins.,"The US Senate voted last week to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act which, because D.C. lawmakers of all stripes love cringe acronyms, stands for the GENIUS Act..The purported stroke of brilliance would lay out the first-ever regulatory framework for stablecoins, or digital tokens pegged to the value of the dollar. It has found both Republican and Democratic support and opposition. Those who see genius in GENIUS say it takes a commonsense approach to balancing innovation and regulation. Those who think it’s a blockheaded approach to blockchain have ideologically diverse critiques, which we’ll get to. A final vote has been scheduled for tomorrow..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.The GENIUS Act, if passed, would let banks and private companies approved by federal regulators issue their own stablecoins. Those issuers would be required to back their stablecoins at all times with a 1:1 reserve of a stable asset, either cash or short-term Treasurys. They’d also be subject to some anti-money laundering laws and be required to adhere to US sanctions on foreign entities. The idea behind using the specified assets is implied in the term stablecoin: It means the tokens are more stable than most digital coins, which can exhibit dramatic price swings. Take, for example, 2022 — when bitcoin had a high of $46,000 in March and a low of around $16,000 in December..The bill and its safeguards have managed to win the support of almost all the Republicans and 18 Democrats in the Senate. And, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, the issue has generated enough excitement that both Amazon and Walmart are entertaining issuing their own stablecoins, a move that would allow them to sidestep billions of fees involved in cash and card transactions that involve the traditional financial system. But there are holdouts in the Senate, and their opposition comes from wildly different places:.First, there’s Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. It’s no surprise that the libertarian-leaning lawmaker is leaning “against” the bill because he’s not convinced of the need for federal regulation of stablecoins at all.

Shell’s president of integrated gas declares that the additional volume will be generated from its various ventures in Canada, Qatar, Nigeria and the UAE..For investors, the additional 12 million tons will be of utmost importance as this will directly boost Shell’s revenues, earnings and cash flows and reinforce its role as a reliable LNG supplier globally. As the LNG demand from Asian countries is expected to rise by 2030, 60% of the new supply is anticipated to come from the United States and Qatar, which can bolster its financial outlook, creating a positive trajectory for the company and the stakeholders..Shell LNG Marketing & Trading (“SLMT”) is the face to customers for its global liquefied natural gas business. In 2024 alone, SLMT delivered nearly 65 million tons of LNG to more than 30 countries worldwide..Shell plays a role in every part of the LNG value chain, from exploration and gas extraction to liquefaction, shipping, regasification and final delivery to customers.

But Where?.Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico.California Pitches Emergency Loans for LA, Local Transit Systems.Producers in the body of water — which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America — will bring on 300,000 barrels of new daily output this year and a further 250,000 barrels in 2026 due to projects many years in the making, according to forecaster Wood Mackenzie Ltd. These will increase production in the region to more than 2 million barrels a day, about 40% higher than in 2020..The growth comes against a backdrop of slowing US shale production due to weaker oil prices, as onshore producers cut rigs and costs to counter rising supplies from OPEC and its allies. Overall US production will decline 0.4% to 13.37 million barrels a day next year, the first drop since 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday..The Gulf’s rising importance represents a turnaround from the past two decades, when the region — tarnished by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, spiraling costs and pandemic shutdowns — took a backseat to the shale boom that has made the US the world’s largest oil producer. But now tumbling crude prices are hurting shale drillers while major, longer-term Gulf projects are starting to come online..“Most people are focused on onshore, when the real growth this year will come from offshore,” Miles Sasser, a senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in an interview. “The projects in the Gulf of America are ramping up nicely, and that should come as a surprise to many.”.Trump has promised to unleash US oil and gas production, and his administration is reworking policies to help boost flows, including from the Gulf. He has also created a National Energy Dominance Council to help expand production. But his global trade war and the OPEC+ supply increases that he has encouraged have hammered crude prices, spurring the pullback by shale drillers..Chevron Corp. will grow Gulf production 50% from last year, to 300,000 barrels a day by 2026.

SUBCY, a Luxembourg-based oil and gas equipment and services company, for its Aphrodite gas development, situated in Trinidad and Tobago’s East Coast Marine Area. This deal marks a major milestone for the oil and gas industry in the region, focusing on the Aphrodite Gas Field, discovered in 2022 on Block 5a, which is set to contribute significantly to Shell's extensive portfolio in the country..The Aphrodite gas field, located in the East Coast Marine Area, is one of the most exciting developments in the country’s natural gas sector. The field is situated at depths reaching up to 290 meters in water, a technical challenge that Shell and Subsea7 are well-equipped to tackle. As part of its extensive regional operations, Shell is implementing a subsea tieback to existing infrastructure serving the Barracuda subsea network, which will play an important role in ensuring the efficient transportation and processing of gas to domestic and international markets..The development of the Aphrodite gas field is strategically important for Shell, marking a continuation of its longstanding commitment to the Trinidad and Tobago energy sector. The gas produced from the field will be exported via Shell’s Dolphin A platform, a key asset in its regional operations. From there, the gas will be sent to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago for domestic consumption and the Beachfield gas processing center for liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) exports to international markets..This project not only strengthens Shell’s gas production capacity in the region but also underlines its growing role in the global LNG market, providing a reliable source of energy to meet the increasing demand worldwide..Subsea7, a leading engineering, construction and services provider for the energy industry, has been contracted to oversee the project management, engineering and offshore operations for the Aphrodite gas field development. This award is a testament to Subsea7's expertise in handling large-scale subsea projects and its growing presence in Latin America and the Caribbean region..The engineering and project management phase for Subsea7 will begin at its Houston office, with offshore operations expected to follow in 2027. The project management phase will involve detailed planning, including developing the subsea installation system, transportation logistics and integrating the subsea tieback with the existing infrastructure. Subsea7’s global expertise in managing complex subsea operations, combined with its commitment to safety and predictable project delivery, will be key to the success of the Aphrodite gas field development.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-awards-subsea-contract-aphrodite-115000564.html,No risk.

This is a significant step in the multinational energy producer’s strategy to secure long-term supply for its regional liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) operations. The move signals renewed confidence in the country's gas-producing potential and aligns with Shell’s global ambition to expand its integrated gas business..Shell expects the first gas from the Aphrodite field by 2027, with peak production estimated at around 18,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Situated in the East Coast Marine Area (“ECMA”), one of the richest hydrocarbon zones in Trinidad and Tobago, the Aphrodite field will serve as a critical backfill source for the Atlantic LNG facility, which has been grappling with persistent natural gas shortages..The Atlantic LNG plant, in which Shell holds a 45% equity stake, possesses an installed capacity of 12 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of supercooled gas. However, chronic supply constraints have prevented the company from realizing its full potential of 5.5 mtpa LNG share. With the Dragon gas project in Venezuela remaining inaccessible following U.S. license revocations, the Aphrodite development emerges as a strategic substitute to stabilize and possibly enhance feedstock volumes for Atlantic LNG..Shell underlined the significance of Aphrodite in extending its gas production footprint within the ECMA, which is already home to flagship assets such as Dolphin, Starfish, Bounty and Endeavour fields. Currently, Shell’s daily natural gas production in Trinidad is more than 600 million cubic feet per day. The development of the Aphrodite field supports greater use of existing offshore facilities and improved asset performance..The final investment decision not only highlights Shell’s commitment to Trinidad and Tobago’s energy sector but also signals its continued confidence in the island nation’s fiscal and regulatory environment. Trinidad remains a strategic hub in Shell’s global LNG supply chain, offering proximity to North America and Europe’s gas markets and access to an established LNG export infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-approves-final-investment-decision-105700755.html,Project Execution Risk Market Risk Geopolitical Risk Regulatory Risk

The Bonga field is located within the OLM118 production sharing contract (PSC) offshore Nigeria, around 120 kilometers to the south of the Niger Delta..Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (“SNEPCo”), a subsidiary of the British energy giant, has agreed to acquire the 12.5% participating interest owned by TotalEnergies EP Nigeria, a subsidiary of TotalEnergies, in the OLM118 PSC. TotalEnergies agreed to the sale of its 12.5% interest for a total of $510 million. Apart from the Bonga field, the OLM118 PSC includes the Bonga North field. The development of the Bonga North field began in 2024..SNEPCo operates the OLM118 PSC, where it holds a 55% stake, alongside its partners, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria, with a 20% stake, and TotalEnergies EP Nigeria and Nigerian Agip Exploration, each with a 12.5% interest..TotalEnergies intends to optimize and upgrade its upstream portfolio by divesting its less competitive assets and focusing on assets with low technical costs and lower emissions. The company will prioritize assets with lower breakeven costs as the production from these assets can be sustained even during periods of low commodity prices. In Nigeria, TTE is currently working on advancing the development of the Ubeta project. This project is aimed at supporting gas supplies to Nigeria LNG..In Nigeria, Shell recently divested its onshore operations to focus on deepwater projects and integrated gas operations. The British energy giant sold off its Nigerian onshore subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (“SPDC”), to Renaissance. The sale included SPDC’s 30% stake in the SPDC joint venture (JV), now owned by Renaissance..The SPDC JV was formed with the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (“NNPC”) holding the majority 55% stake, alongside Total Exploration and Production Nigeria, with a 10% stake, and Agip Energy and Natural Resources (Nigeria) Limited holding a 5% stake. Shell’s purchase of TTE’s 12.5% participating interest in the Bonga field aligns with its strategy of focusing on deepwater and offshore operations in Nigeria..Both SHEL and TTE currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-acquires-bonga-field-stake-132900724.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Political Risk Environmental Risk

This strategic divestment includes more than 200 fuel service stations, convenience stores and fuel import infrastructure, positioning Iconn as a dominant force in Mexico’s energy and convenience retail space. The acquisition, which remains pending regulatory approval, is expected to close by the third quarter of 2025, signaling a notable shift in Mexico’s competitive energy market..The portfolio, which Shell Mobility is offloading, includes a network of company-operated and franchised gas stations, convenience retail outlets and commercial fuel services under the Shell Solutions brand. A key asset in the deal is Shell’s fuel import license, highly strategic in a country reliant on imported petroleum. Iconn will gain ownership not only of Shell’s physical retail footprint but also fuel supply and logistics operations, significantly expanding its role in the energy value chain..This acquisition grants Iconn full access to Shell-branded stations across major states in Mexico, along with logistics infrastructure for fleet fueling services and integrated convenience store platforms. It marks a transformation in Iconn’s operational capacity, enabling control from fuel import and storage to point-of-sale delivery..Already dominant through Petro Seven and 7-Eleven, Iconn gains strategic advantages from integrating Shell’s assets. Shell’s proprietary fuel technologies, customer loyalty platforms and branding will allow Iconn to enhance its retail offerings and differentiate from both national oil companies and independent operators. The acquisition also positions Iconn to introduce premium fuel options and expand digital services such as advanced fleet management and supply-chain efficiency..These capabilities provide Iconn with the tools to compete directly with Pemex and other established energy brands across the fuel value chain. Shell’s presence in urban hubs and along transport corridors adds strategic locations to Iconn’s network. Whether continuing under the Shell brand via licensing or rebranding under Petro Seven, these sites offer strong foundations for long-term growth..Shell’s exit highlights the growing regulatory complexity in Mexico’s downstream energy sector. Increased scrutiny over fuel imports and measures to curb illegal trade have created an inhospitable climate for foreign investment. This move follows similar challenges faced by other foreign operators like Valero Energy. While Shell’s departure signals a reduction in international participation, it creates opportunities for local players like Iconn to take over key infrastructure and drive innovation. The acquisition reallocates strategic control from global to local hands, enabling Iconn to dominate from import to retail.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-exit-mexico-retail-fuel-120500122.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Reputational Risk

This transaction includes the transfer of around 200 gas stations and a fuel storage terminal located in Gresik, with completion expected by next year..Despite this move, Shell remains firmly rooted in Indonesia. The company emphasized that it will continue to operate under brand licensing agreements, maintaining visibility and legacy in the region..The acquiring joint venture brings together the strengths of two long-standing Shell partners. Citadel Pacific, a private holding company based in the Philippines, has its presence across various industries like aviation-related services, telecommunication, gas distribution and fuel marketing. The company licenses the Shell brand across multiple territories, including Guam, Hong Kong and Macau. Sefas Group, on the other hand, is Indonesia’s largest Shell lubricants distributor..Their collaboration signals continuity for customers and partners, backed by a solid history of representing the Shell brand across various markets..While Shell is stepping away from fuel retailing, it is optimizing the portfolio by doubling down on the lubricants business in Indonesia, a market described as key for growth. Shell operates a major lubricant blending plant in the country with a capacity of up to 300 million litres annually and a new grease manufacturing plant is currently under construction. With this repositioning, Shell reinforces its strengths in high-growth, high-margin segments that can alleviate its profitability in the future..London-based Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors, a group of U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.

2025-05-26 17:34:00,Shell Expects Major LNG Exporters Turning Into Importers,"SHEL expects former LNG exporters like Indonesia and Algeria to turn into importers, boosting global demand amid Asia's growing energy needs.","Shell plc SHEL predicts that several traditional LNG (liquefied natural gas) exporters, including Indonesia, Malaysia and Algeria, may soon become net importers. This trend is being driven by rising domestic demand and falling production in these countries. The shift that is reshaping the global energy landscape will not only drive demand for LNG but also ease the oversupply concerns that the industry was facing due to new upcoming projects..Shell estimates that the role reversal of countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Algeria could add as much as 50 million metric tons of new LNG demand by 2040..The company predicts that these countries are likely to follow in Egypt’s footsteps, which has already made the transition last year by turning into a net LNG importer. Egypt has secured deals worth $3 billion with Shell and TotalEnergies to buy 40-60 LNG cargoes as it grapples with an energy crunch..While some producers like Diamond Gas International and TotalEnergies have warned of a potential LNG glut around 2027-2028, Shell maintains a more measured outlook. Shell estimates that since the LNG projects have faced delays in the past owing to the COVID era, ongoing supply-chain bottlenecks and labor shortages, especially on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the rollout of new LNG capacity is likely to be gradual and phased..Asia remains the key demand center. Shell forecasts a 60% increase in global LNG demand by 2040, powered by economic expansion, the energy needs of AI and data centers, and a push to decarbonize heavy industries and transport..However, Shell cautioned that this rising demand in Asia is sensitive to prices. The company observed that when the Spot prices dropped below $10 per million British Thermal Units in the second quarter, the purchases from Asia’s buyers saw a swift resurgence, highlighting the delicate balance between pricing and uptake..London-based Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors, a group of U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.

At its recent annual general meeting (AGM), over 20% of investors backed a resolution calling for greater transparency around the company’s gas-heavy strategy, citing concerns about climate commitments and long-term economic risk..Shell is betting heavily on gas in anticipation of a 60% global increase in demand through 2040, primarily from Asian markets. Based on the bolstered demand predictions, the company plans to grow its annual LNG sales by 4-5% until 2030, and increase the annual top-line production in its integrated gas business by 1%..The resolution, filed by three U.K. local authority pension funds and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, urged Shell to clarify how its aggressive gas investments align with climate goals. Critics argue that Shell’s exposure to LNG outpaces industry peers, and that projected demand from Asia may fall short if cheaper alternatives or stricter global emissions regulations emerge. They also added that shareholders lack sufficient data to evaluate the risks associated with Shell’s gas-heavy strategy..In accordance with the U.K. listing rules, companies are obliged to explain how they will tackle shareholder concerns if they receive a shareholder opposition of more than 20%. Therefore, in this case, Shell will have to meet the shareholders’ concerns and provide a proper explanation..Shell’s CEO, Wael Sawan, defended the company’s approach, asserting that gas plays a vital role in displacing more polluting fuels like coal and heavy oil. He pointed to gas —the largest contributor to lowering CO2 emissions —as a practical enabler of the energy transition, especially as renewables scale up..Sawan also argued that LNG infrastructure is essential to support renewable energy by stabilizing electricity grids, citing recent blackouts in Spain as a cautionary example. He affirmed that Shell remains committed to reducing its emissions footprint through carbon capture and storage initiatives..The 20.56% protest vote requires Shell to engage directly with shareholders and provide an official response within six months. The company acknowledged that the protest was consistent with past climate-related dissent and promised a detailed “summary note” ahead of the next AGM.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-faces-shareholder-pressure-over-093100441.html,Reputational Risk Financial Risk Operational Risk

The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving revenues. The company expects net revenues to grow in high-single to low-double digits in fiscal 2025. Visa, fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, Visa’s elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect adjusted operating expenses to rise 9.5% year over year in fiscal 2025. The company is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Hence, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9% vs. -5%). The company beat Q1 estimates for earnings but missed on sales. Its key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, and Fasenra should keep driving revenues. AstraZeneca’s pipeline is strong, with pivotal late and mid-stage pipeline data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. However, potentially lower sales of Lynparza and Farxiga in China, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology sales and slowing sales of rare disease drugs are expected to hurt the top line in 2025. (You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here >>>)Shell’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the year-to-date period (+8% vs. -1.3%). The company, being the largest oil firm in Europe, has solid fundamentals, and the stock looks fairly balanced at the moment. London-based Shell plc remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Shell leverages its strong LNG position, bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel. Strategic moves like the Equinor JV and Pavilion Energy acquisition also support long-term growth. However, a few red flags keep the outlook in check: Q1 revenue missed by $10B, chemical margins remain weak, and reserve replacement continues to lag. Add macro risks, delayed earnings impact from new projects, and ongoing pressure from the energy transition, and the near-term setup feels mixed. For now, investors may prefer to wait for a better entry point before buying Shell shares.(You can read the full research report on Shell here >>>)Shares of Ocean Power Technologies have outperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past year (+202.3% vs. +42.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $90.50 million offers strong revenue visibility with a record $7.5 million backlog, driven by global demand for its AI-enabled PowerBuoy and WAM-V platforms across defense and commercial sectors. Financial discipline is evident as cash burn fell 41% and liquidity rose to $10.2 million. Ocean Power Technologies shift to a recurring revenue model (DaaS/RaaS) enhances margin potential and customer stickiness. Advanced autonomous systems support long-duration maritime ops with minimal oversight, addressing needs in defense, energy, and environmental monitoring. However, risks include persistent losses ($15.1 million YTD), liquidity concerns, high client concentration, and dilution from equity financing. Products remain in early commercialization, and governance issues plus emerging market exposure introduce further uncertainty.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $3.32 million have equity value is pressured by dilution from preferred redemptions and stock splits, and liquidity has tightened, with $489 million in debt and a decline in cash to $19.2 million. Legal overhang, weakening NOI, and declining Cedar leasing trends signal operational headwinds. Despite a high implied Series D dividend yield, risks from asset erosion, derivative liabilities and regional concentration constrain long-term upside. Despite ongoing challenges, WHLR’s valuations offer a potential value opportunity relative to its historical norms and industry peers.Nevertheless, Wheeler Real Estate has improved its balance sheet via $13 million in Series D Preferred redemptions and $18.3 million in asset sales, reducing leverage and generating $5.7 million in net gains.

2025-05-14 17:39:00,Shell Faces Renewed Legal Pressure on Fossil Fuel Expansion,"SHEL's fossil fuel expansion draws new legal threats in Netherlands, claiming it violates a court order to cut carbon emissions.","Shell plc SHEL is under intensifying legal scrutiny as environmental organization Milieudefensie, the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth, announces fresh legal action. The NGO, based in Netherlands, claims that by investing in new oil and gas projects despite a previous court decision requiring emissions reductions, the integrated oil and gas company violated its duty of care under Dutch law. This case could escalate tensions between fossil fuel corporations and climate activists pressing for stricter adherence to international climate goals..The foundation of this new lawsuit lies in a historic 2021 court decision, upheld in part during a 2023 appeal, which found Shell partially liable for climate change. The appeal acknowledged Shell’s obligation to reduce CO2 emissions, citing its substantial role in contributing to the climate crisis. However, it stopped short of specifying a target percentage for reductions. Milieudefensie now argues that Shell’s ongoing fossil fuel investments clearly violate the legal duties affirmed by that judgment..“Companies like Shell have it within their power to combat the climate problem and therefore have a legal obligation to reduce emissions,” stated the Dutch Court of Appeal..Despite growing climate concerns, Shell reaffirmed during the recent Capital Markets Day that it plans to expand fossil fuel operations, particularly in the sectors of liquefied natural gas and oil production through 2040. This strategy directly conflicts with climate science, which indicates that new fossil fuel development must be halted to limit global warming to 1.5°C..More than 700 new oil and gas fields are presently under development by Shell, per a thorough report by Milieudefensie and Global Witness. Since May 2021, Shell has finalized investment decisions for 32 new projects, potentially resulting in 972 million tons of CO2 emissions, an amount nearly equivalent to the annual emissions of the entire European Union..The main thrust of Milieudefensie's argument is that the climate crisis is essentially a fossil fuel crisis. Over 80% of global carbon emissions are attributed to fossil fuel use, with oil and gas accounting for more than half of that. The NGO claims that companies like Shell are deliberately stalling the energy transition by prioritizing short-term profits over long-term planetary health.

At peak rates, the output capacity from the field is 125,000 Boe/d..The Perdido development includes three field, namely Great White, Tobago and Silvertip.  As part of its efforts to boost production at the platform, Shell had also mentioned that it planned to bring two additional wells into production at the Silvertip unit in December 2024.

2025-05-13 00:58:00,Trauber: Shell-BP Merger Would Make “A Lot of Sense”,"BP’s U.S. shale operations include the Permian, Eagle Ford and Haynesville. The next wave of oil and gas consolidation may include mergers between the majors, veteran M&A insider Stephen Trauber of Moelis tells Hart Energy.","Amid speculation that European supermajor Shell is weighing a merger with its U.K. counterpart BP, Hart Energy reached out for expert perspective on the prospective deal, which could hinge in part on interest in accessing Permian Basin shale interests held by BPX, BP’s U.S. affiliate. BPX’s sizeable footprint includes the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales..Stephen Trauber, managing director, chairman and global head of energy and clean technology at Moelis, breaks it down in this exclusive interview with Deon Daugherty, editor-in-chief of Oil and Gas Investor..This interview has been edited for clarity, length and style..Deon Daugherty, editor-in-chief, Oil and Gas Investor: So late last year, you and I were talking about M&A, and you mentioned that maybe it would make sense for the U.S. majors, the likes of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, to purchase their European peers simply because those majors had put so much into the energy transition and it had not paid off. In light of the speculation about Shell buying BP, let’s revisit that train of thought. How are you looking at this sort of mega merger now?.Stephen Trauber, managing director, chairman and global head of energy and clean technology, Moelis: Having worked on many of the super major deals that came together 20 years ago between Exxon and Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum, I start with the fact that there tends to be billions of dollars of value created by putting these large companies together and high-grading the asset portfolio, improving returns, improving free cash flow, reducing capex on a combined basis, et cetera..That story still holds true today. That same philosophy is why some of these other bigger deals happened that we saw over the last 18 months. There are tremendous benefits and savings by doing that. And there happens to be now a pretty big disparity in the valuation between European majors and the U.S. majors because the European majors, particularly Shell and BP, went down a path of diverting a lot of their free cash flow into what I would state was low-returning energy transition/cleantech M&A opportunities. They lost their shareholder base as a result of that, and their valuations have suffered..DD: Do the U.S. majors find the international majors interesting from an asset-fit perspective? .ST: That becomes a key question from a valuation perspective. It looks clearly very additive when you add in the disparity in valuations and the synergies achievable during those combinations. The other big question is always, ‘Will the governments, the local governments where these companies are domiciled, will they let their large energy companies be bought by U.S. companies?’ Another big question: Are there any trust issues, particularly in the areas of marketing and retail between these companies?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trauber-shell-bp-merger-lot-165800527.html,Merger Risk Regulatory Risk Market Risk

As it has been speculated on and off for decades, UK peer Shell could be the most likely buyer, according to recent market talk..Speculation about another oil giant taking over BP is not new—such rumors have been swirling for over a decade, particularly ones suggesting that Shell could be the bidder for a merger with BP..Speculation about a blockbuster acquisition involving BP resurfaced again this year after activist hedge fund Elliott bought nearly 5% in the UK-based supermajor and demanded changes, big and fast..BP’s shares have underperformed the stocks of the other four of the Big Oil group – Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, and Chevron – ever since 2020..Neither former BP CEO Bernard Looney, with the push toward renewables, nor his successor Murray Auchincloss, with the strategy reset to return on the path of oil and gas, have managed to erase the company’s underperformance in the past five years..After BP reported the weakest set of Q1 results among Big Oil and reduced by $1 billion its quarterly share buyback program as cash flow declined and net debt rose, speculation of a Shell-BP megadeal intensified..Related: Russia Claims Active Talks With China on New Gas Pipeline Are Underway.This week, Bloomberg reported that Shell is considering the merits of a takeover bid for BP, which has seen its fortunes dim recently after its rather premature bet on a fast energy transition..Unnamed sources familiar with the developments have told Bloomberg that Shell was studying a takeover that would depend on whether the BP stock would continue to decline after losing close to 30% over the past 12 months..Neither Shell nor BP have commented on the media and market speculation..Shell’s CEO Wael Sawan told analysts on the Q1 earnings call last week that “before we ever look at a sizable inorganic, we have to have our own house in order.”.“I’ve said in the past we want to be value hunters. Today value hunting, in my view, is buying back more Shell,” Sawan said..Still, market analysts and investment banks have started to run the numbers on how big a Shell-BP oil and gas giant could be..For sure, a combined group would have nearly 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in oil and gas production, UBS has estimated..It would be the world’s biggest investor-owned oil and producer, outpacing ExxonMobil, whose worldwide oil-equivalent production was 4.55-4.6 million boepd in the past two quarters. Chevron’s net oil-equivalent production was 3.353 million boepd in the first quarter.

In other words, investors can purchase Shell's shares before the 15th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of June..The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.358 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.43 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Shell has a trailing yield of 4.4% on the current stock price of UK£24.58. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Shell can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Shell paid out 64% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 28% of its free cash flow in the past year..It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.. Check out our latest analysis for Shell .Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends..Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Shell earnings per share are up 2.8% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-until-shell-070304107.html,No risk.

Our analysis...,"The market for Shell plc's (LON:SHEL) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. Our analysis suggests that while the profits are soft, the foundations of the business are strong..Our free stock report includes 1 warning sign investors should be aware of before investing in Shell. Read for free now..To properly understand Shell's profit results, we need to consider the US$4.0b expense attributed to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Shell to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal..That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates..Because unusual items detracted from Shell's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Shell's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Shell and we think they deserve your attention..Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Shell's profit.

A week later, Trump then announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for many US trading partners..However, tensions escalated between the US and China, with back-and-forth moves on trade between the two countries keeping concerns around the economic impact of tariffs in focus..Towards the end of the month both Washington and Beijing appeared to soften their stance on trade negotiations, which provided a boost to markets, though uncertainty around if and when a deal will be reached is still a concern..Read more: The most bought US stocks in Trump's first 100 days.The end of April also marked the end of the first hundred days of Trump's second term. According to Capital Economics, the US stock market and dollar fared worse in this period than in the first 100 days of any other presidential term since 1980..While a rebound in stocks towards the end of April, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is still down 4.7% year-to-date..“April was a tough month for investors given Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs,"" said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Interactive Investor, adding that investors' ""desire for safe havens helped gold rise by close to 5% during the month."".Here's more detail on which investments proved most popular last months across UK platforms Interactive Investor, Hargreaves Lansdown, Robinhood (HOOD) and Bestinvest..Oil prices have fallen over concerns that trade war will lead to a recession and weigh on global demand for fuel..""That impacted heavily on oil major BP (BP.L), bringing its shares back into the sharp investor focus,"" said Bowman.

While no formal bid has been made, Shell is said to be quietly evaluating the strategic and financial feasibility of such a move, according to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter..Discussions inside Shell have gained momentum in recent weeks, driven largely by BP’s declining market capitalization. BP’s shares have lost nearly 22.4% over the past year due to weak oil prices, strategic missteps and investor discontent. Shell is reportedly monitoring BP’s market value and could make a move if conditions become more favorable, either due to further price declines or an indication that BP is open to external interest..While a takeover is far from certain, Shell is preparing for different scenarios, including the possibility of another bidder stepping in. Sources note that Shell could use its early groundwork to act swiftly if needed..At present, Shell’s market capitalization is more than double that of BP, standing at approximately $200.5 billion versus BP’s $76 billion. This highlights a significant divergence in performance and scale between the two London-based oil majors..BP’s vulnerabilities have become more apparent following a turbulent leadership transition. Former CEO Bernard Looney’s rapid push toward green energy alienated investors, and his successor, Murray Auchincloss, has since pivoted toward oil and gas assets. However, broader challenges, including macroeconomic uncertainty and increased crude output from OPEC+, have eroded BP’s financial footing..Brent crude recently fell below $70 per barrel, complicating BP’s cash flow outlook and further straining shareholder patience. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has taken a 5% stake in BP and is pressuring the company to enact more drastic changes to revive performance and fend off potential takeovers..Shell, under CEO Wael Sawan, is undergoing its own strategic overhaul. The company has been streamlining operations, trimming underperforming renewable energy units and refocusing on its core fossil fuel portfolio..Shell's CEO recently stated that any major acquisition would need to substantially enhance the company’s free cash flow per share and overall returns. He emphasized that SHEL’s primary focus is on delivering value and that transformational deals would only be pursued if they align with the company’s long-term financial objectives.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-mulls-bp-acquisition-regain-111200185.html,Merger and Acquisition Risk Regulatory Risk Market Risk Financial Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other undervalued energy stocks..As of the close of May 2, 2025, the overall energy sector is undervalued by 13.1%, as compared to the general market’s undervaluation of 5.3%. The current downturn in the energy sector is primarily attributed to the current trade war sparked by President Trump’s tariffs and its resultant forecasted global economic slowdown. Moreover, global crude oil prices have plunged heavily since last month, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price currently hovering around the $56 mark – a level it last hit during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021..READ ALSO: Top 15 Energy Companies With the Highest Upside Potential.Crude oil took a fresh hit this weekend after OPEC+ stunned the market by announcing a larger-than-expected output increase for June. This follows a similar surge announced for May and signals a sharp reversal from the group’s efforts to defend crude prices. It seems like Saudi Arabia has adopted a low-price strategy, aiming to discipline overproducing members like Kazakhstan and Iraq. This could also be a part of Riyadh’s efforts to build good relations with Donald Trump, who has recently been calling on the Kingdom to increase production in order to bring prices down. Given the high volatility in the market, it comes as no surprise that short-sellers marginally increased their bets against oil and gas stocks in March, with short interest in the energy sector reaching 2.58% compared to 2.52% in February..That said, while oil may be presenting a bleak outlook, there are other sectors within the energy business that look very promising right now. A significant growth driver for the global energy industry is the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying power-hungry data centers. According to the International Energy Agency, the global electricity demand from data centers is set to more than double by 2030 to around 945 terawatt-hours (TWh), slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today. The rise of AI is also reshaping US power markets, as according to BNEF, the country’s data center demand is projected to rise from 3.5% of total electricity demand today to 8.6% by 2035..Big Tech seems to have jumped headfirst into the AI boom, with commitments to invest hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and ensure their energy supply. In fact, this strategic move has injected new life into sectors such as nuclear, which has regained the spotlight after several tech giants met on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference in March and signed a pledge to support the goal of at least tripling the world’s nuclear energy capacity by 2050.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-plc-shel-among-most-120606022.html,Market Risk

The company vowed to slash its oil and gas production and invest heavily in renewables in 2020, making the boldest commitment to net zero in the fossil fuel industry..However, the strategy failed to deliver financial returns and BP has recently abandoned the plans in favour of a return to focusing on oil and gas.

The divergence has left BP worth just £55bn, compared to Shell’s £148bn..A combination of Shell and BP has long been speculated but a deal would be likely to face intense political scrutiny and attract the attention of competition regulators. Any deal would also trigger a bonanza of fees for advisers and bankers..Shell is understood to be biding its time and awaiting further drops in BP’s shares and oil prices before deciding whether to bid..A Shell spokesman said: “As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.”.Wael Sawan, Shell’s chief executive, told analysts on Friday that the oil giant “of course ... will keep looking at inorganic opportunities” for growth but said the “the bar is high” for deals..Buying back Shell’s own shares currently presents the best value for money, he argued. Mr Sawan said: “I have said in the past that we want to be value hunters. Today, value-hunting – in my view – is buying back more Shell.”.The chief executive added that Shell needed to “have our own house in order” before doing big takeovers..A swoop for BP could help Shell boost output by gaining more exposure to the US. BP has significant operations in the Gulf of Mexico and announced a fresh discovery there just last month..It would also help Shell build the scale to better compete with US oil giants, whose value dwarfs Shell. Exxon Mobil, for example, is worth $459bn (£345bn).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-plots-bid-bp-amid-130729439.html,Merger and Acquisition Risk Operational Risk Reputational Risk Financial Risk

Chevron, if you can take a look at that stock, you see Chevron moving lower, Exxon moving to the upside, but Chevron cutting plans for its share buybacks, while Exxon Mobile gains after reporting it is on pace for its planned $20 billion in buybacks. Both companies dealing with a slowdown in oil prices as well. Joining us now with more Dan Dicker, the Energy Word founder. Dan, great to speak with you here. I want to start with your overall takeaway from how these two firms were able to handle the slide in oil prices that we've seen over the course of the last quarter. To what extent did that impact these names? .Well, both, both have reported. I mean, the expectations were already very bad for both Chevron and Exxon. Exxon executed better. I mean, they definitely beat the expectations, but their expectations were down for the last three quarters. And obviously, it's based on an oil price that is continuing to be under pressure and with increasing recession risks that continue to to build out there. Uh, it doesn't bode well. Till this morning, I mean, obviously, Exxons did doing a little bit better in the market than Chevron is based on that better execution. But the bottom line problem for both of these companies is clearly price of oil. And and that's something that they're going to have a difficulty maneuvering going forward, both of them. .Yeah, oil, even with some of the interim rebound that we've seen, is still set for another weekly loss here. And so, all of that considered, as you're kind of looking out into the future and the forecast for both of these companies, you have a president that's talked about drill, baby, drill. But for these companies that are also trying to maintain their own margins and have a duty to investors to really showcase what that pipeline looks like for the future prospects of the business, you know, how are you kind of drawing, drawing a line between the two, what is kind of talked about from the administration side, but what's the reality for the business and the industry more broadly? .Yeah, I mean, quite frankly, the, um, whatever it is that the oil companies managed to get out of the White House in terms of some a couple of cabinet picks and so on, is not being, um, uh, reflected in terms of positives for the companies compared to obviously the tariff problem and the recession risk that's going into it. I mean, you don't have to be a genius to realize that these companies rely upon a price in order for them to make profits. And it's just not there. I mean, at this point, I've been negative on, on majors since the middle of 24, actually, as these kind of supply demand numbers have gone against the oil companies for a while. And that's proved out. And it's getting worse all the time. I mean, I've been trying to tell my investors that the best values are really in the renewable sustainable space. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has disincentivized all of that as well. I mean, they've stopped payments on the, um, the Biden, um, inflation reduction act that was helping all of these renewables gain their footing. And so right now there's dead money everywhere in the energy sector. I mean, I can't tell people to put money into Exxon or Chevron, I can't tell people to put money into constellation or or first solar. And you know, I tell them that they've got to sit back at least in the energy sector and wait, and maybe put their money in Bitcoin because it seems like that's what the president is interested in pushing for. .So you're saying there's no opportunity within the energy sector right now, even when you do, you know, you have Exxon maintaining buybacks, that doesn't entice you? .Well, they've been maintaining buybacks for many, many years, and they've solid in that. So what I tell people is that, yeah, you can own majors, but depend upon the dividend, depend upon, you know, the bond, like a bond, and play it that way. I mean, you basically are looking at a company that has very little upside alpha that's going for it. And you know, so basically what you're dealing with is something that's very much like a fixed income kind of investment. Now, a lot of people don't mind having something like that. I have majors in my portfolio too, but I don't take it as something that's this tremendous opportunity for, you know, a 20 or a 30% gain or something even better than that. .Dan, good to get your perspective as always.

Economists forecast 135,000 non-farm payrolls were added last month, while the unemployment rate and hourly wages held steady at 4.2% and 0.3% respectively. Taking a look at earnings, we'll have big oil capping off a big week of earnings. We'll be getting reports from Exxon, Chevron, and Shell in the morning. Exxon will announce results for its first quarter before the markets open. Analysts expect the company to benefit from higher oil and gas prices and better downstream margins. And finally, the Trump administration eliminating the de minimis exemption for low value imports from China. The exemption currently allows goods valued at $800 or less to enter the US duty-free. E-commerce companies like Shine, Temu, which is owned by PDD Holdings, and Alibaba, they're all bracing for the closure, which could lead to further price increases from goods for goods from those Chinese retailers.

2025-05-01 19:26:00,Shell to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?,SHEL topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other.,"Shell plc SHEL is set to release first-quarter results on May 2. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is earnings of $1.59 per share on revenues of $79.9 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the integrated energy behemoth’s results in the March quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at SHEL’s previous-quarter performance first..In the last reported quarter, Europe’s largest oil company missed the consensus mark, dragged down by weaker realized prices, drop in trading margins and lower LNG sales. SHEL had reported earnings per ADS (on a current cost of supplies basis, excluding items — the market’s preferred measure) — of $1.20, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78. Revenues of $66.8 billion also came in 16.6% below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Shell beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other, resulting in an earnings surprise of 3.6%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:.Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR price-eps-surprise | Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR Quote.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 33.2% drop year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, however, suggests a 7% decrease from the year-ago period..Shell recently issued an updated outlook for the first quarter of 2025, signaling challenges in its liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations and broader production levels. The company revised its Q1 LNG production forecast to a range of 6.4-6.8 million metric tons, with the midpoint notably lower than its previous 6.6–7.2 million ton estimate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 6.81 million tons. The downgrade stems from severe cyclones and unplanned maintenance affecting its Australian operations, especially at the Prelude floating LNG facility.While these weather-related disruptions have hindered output, Shell has noted that gas trading results are expected to remain stable versus the prior quarter. Still, the incident underscores the operational risks tied to natural events and technical setbacks. Shell also lowered its integrated gas production guidance to 930,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), compared to the earlier estimate of 960,000 boe/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate pegs it at 931,000 boe/d. The decline is again linked to unplanned downtime in Australia, though management efforts have helped cushion the financial impact.Further, Shell anticipates a $100 million exploration write-off in Q1, highlighting potential difficulties in new project development or asset viability. Exploration write-offs are not unusual, but they suggest that Shell may be adjusting its priorities or reevaluating underperforming ventures.In its marketing division, Shell expects lower results from its specialty products business, which includes lower-carbon energy offerings for marine and aviation sectors. This indicates that while the company is actively investing in cleaner energy solutions, market conditions and early-stage transitions continue to present obstacles.Shell also revised its upstream oil and gas production forecast for the quarter to between 1.79 and 1.89 million boe/d, slightly down from the previous range of 1.75 to 1.95 million boe/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment sits at 1.84 million boe/d. Operational setbacks, including weather and maintenance, have made it difficult for Shell to consistently hit its output targets. However, the company continues to focus on cost control and operational efficiency across its upstream portfolio.Despite the short-term production hurdles, Shell remains committed to its integrated energy strategy. The company’s resilience in managing through disruptions and its sustained investment in both traditional and renewable energy assets reflect a balanced approach to long-term growth. Still, with output lowered across key divisions and added pressure from write-downs and weaker specialty product margins, the first quarter is shaping up to be a mixed one for Shell.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-report-q1-earnings-whats-112600871.html,No risk.

These discussions coincide with broader market volatility marked by a sliding Dow Jones following weak GDP data. Despite these events, Shell's share price remained flat over the past week, aligning with overarching market trends where some stability was observed following initial turbulence. The developments surrounding Shell's renewable assets and market conditions appear to have added complexity to Shell's performance amidst an evolving economic landscape..We've spotted 1 possible red flag for Shell you should be aware of..The latest GPUs need a type of rare earth metal called Dysprosium and there are only 23 companies in the world exploring or producing it. Find the list for free..Shell's recent challenges in offloading its Indian renewable platform, Sprng Energy, due to valuation discrepancies and stalled negotiations may add layers of complexity to its revenue and earnings forecasts. This difficulty comes as the company faces uncertainties in its LNG market and potential execution risks, which could exert additional pressure on its projected financial targets. Despite these challenges, Shell's utilization of new technologies promises potential improvements in operational performance and net margins, though revenue unpredictability remains a concern..Over a five-year period, Shell's total shareholder return, which accounts for share price appreciation and dividends, reached 122.69%. This performance provides a longer-term perspective on the company's capacity to deliver value to shareholders, showcasing strength despite short-term volatility. However, in the past year, Shell's return underperformed compared to the overall UK market, which posted a modest 1.4% gain..At present, Shell's share price is A$24.32, falling short of the consensus analyst price target of A$31.22 by approximately 22.6%. This suggests potential upside, assuming the company can navigate its current challenges effectively. Analysts project Shell's earnings to rise to $21.1 billion by April 2028, indicating potential growth, though current hurdles in the renewables and LNG sectors may influence these predictions. With analysts estimating Shell to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.4x by 2028, compared to its current valuation of 12.1x, the future trajectory remains contingent on its ability to capitalize on both technological advancements and streamlined capital practices.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-lse-shel-faces-roadblocks-175752065.html,Strategic Risk Financial Risk Operational Risk

The survey will help Shell pinpoint future drilling sites and finalize the design of the pipeline that will be used to transport the gas to Trinidad. The company is going ahead with this survey with the hope that the U.S. government will eventually ease sanctions on it and allow the project’s development in the future..Shell had contracted the vessel earlier this month, just as the U.S. administration announced the revocation of a 2023 license that permitted the company earlier for planning and development of the Dragon field. Both Shell and NGC were instructed to conclude their operations in Venezuela by May 27..Trinidad, a major exporter of LNG, ammonia and methanol, is facing declining natural gas reserves. The Dragon gas field represented a rare and valuable opportunity to enhance Trinidad’s gas reserves, ensuring long-term energy security for the nation’s industries. The field, located just off the Venezuelan coast, is rich in untapped gas reserves, and Venezuela granted Shell a 30-year operating license last year. The company was expected to begin gas exports to Trinidad by 2025..Since 2019, when the U.S. government started imposing sanctions on Venezuela, special licenses have been required by companies to plan and develop oil and gas projects with the Venezuelan state-owned company PDVSA. While the U.S. government accuses Venezuela of not restoring democracy by returning illegal migrants, Venezuelan officials condemn the sanctions as an attempt toward economic war..London-based Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors — a group of the U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Currently, SHEL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)..Investors interested in the energy sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like Expand Energy Corporation EXE, Delek Logistics Partners, LP DKL and Diversified Energy Company PLC DEC. While Expand Energy and Delek Logistics currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Diversified Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The bullish outlook comes despite market concerns about a slowdown due to tightening US chip export controls..TSMC's CEO insisted there had been no change in behaviour from customers since the start of US president Donald Trump’s tariff war as it left its profit forecasts unchanged..CC Wei said the company would “continue to closely monitor the potential impact to the market demand” but said the business was enjoying “robust demand from our customers”..Chief financial officer Wendell Huang said TSMC planned to spend between $38bn and $42bn on capital investment this year. For the second quarter, the group forecast revenue between $28.4bn and $29.2bn — significantly ahead of the $20.8bn reported in the same period a year earlier..Amid heightened US-China trade tensions, TSMC's revenue from China slipped to 7% of total sales, down from 9% a year ago. North America accounted for 77%, up from 69%..Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “For TSMC it is very much a case of keep calm and carry on. It’s latest set of figures highlight a very resilient business in the face of significant tariff threats for the semiconductor industry. Revenues grew by 35%, while margins remained very robust. Much of the demand continues to come from artificial intelligence and this shows no sign of abating."".Deliveroo (ROO.L) reported a pickup in order volumes in the first quarter but struggled to add new customers in the UK and Ireland..Orders rose 7% year on year, slightly faster than the 6% growth seen at the end of 2024.

2025-04-16 18:32:00,Shell Signs Deal to Explore Bulgaria's Black Sea for Oil and Gas,"SHEL signs an exploration deal with Bulgaria's government for oil and gas in the Black Sea, taking a step forward toward the nation's energy independence.","Shell plc’s SHEL affiliate, Shell Exploration and Production, has inked a contract with the Bulgarian energy ministry for oil and gas exploration offshore Block 1-26 of the Khan Tervel field, in the country's exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea. The agreement was followed by a competitive bidding process that took place in June. The block, spanning an impressive 4,032 square kilometers, offers robust potential for oil and gas exploration..On June 18, Bulgaria’s energy minister initiated a bidding procedure for a permit for oil and gas exploration in the Khan Tervel field offshore in the Black Sea. The exploration permit with a total term of five years has the option of being extended twice by two years..The bidding process required the applicants to fulfill certain criteria relating to their revenue generation and also required them to have software for interpreting seismic data to carry out the project activities..The bidding proposal attracted interest from four companies. However, only two companies submitted full proposals. Shell secured the contract backed by its robust exploration plan, environmental safeguards and commitment to local capacity building..Per the deal, SHEL’s exploration program would include comprehensive geological and geophysical work, notably new 3D seismic surveys and detailed data interpretation. These efforts would aim to evaluate the region’s true potential beneath the Black Sea seabed..Beyond exploration, Shell has pledged to finance educational initiatives designed to train Bulgarian specialists in the fields of oil and gas exploration and production. This not only supports local employment but also contributes to the nation’s long-term technical capabilities in the energy sector..Shell is also committed to carrying out all exploration activities by adhering to stringent safety and environmental standards..Until 2022, Bulgaria, a European Union member, had been totally dependent on Russia for its energy supplies. However, taking a step toward energy independence, the country is now looking to diversify its gas supplies and find cheaper sources..The country’s energy minister highlights the contract’s potential to support Bulgaria’s energy independence. If viable resources are discovered, up to 30% of the benefits will be returned to the state through concession fees as the country will not incur any transit fee for delivery. Additionally, Shell will pay an annual area fee and provide a bonus payment over the five-year exploration period.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-signs-deal-explore-bulgarias-103200944.html,Geopolitical Risk Regulatory Risk Exploration Risk Commodity Price Risk Environmental Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best oil stocks..After an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year..READ NEXT: 10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.The continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable..The escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts..The American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well..The pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-plc-shel-one-best-185306760.html,No risk.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other undervalued energy stocks..On March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports..Thummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices..Thummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns..We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against other best UK stocks to invest in..Like most of the world, the United Kingdom is also facing slower economic growth in 2025, fuelled by an unpredictable trading environment and high taxes. According to KPMG, there are some upsides to the UK economy this year, including solid household savings and robust public spending. However, American tariffs could limit UK GDP growth to only 0.8% during 2025 and 2026. In the short term, inflation will likely come back due to growing labor costs and skyrocketing energy prices. Nonetheless, KPMG forecasts that inflation will simmer down to the Bank of England’s target of 2% by the middle of next year..What came as a surprise was the UK economy going up by 0.1% in Q4 2024, a welcome reprieve from the sodden economic outlook painted by market experts. This made Britain the top performer in Europe during the fourth quarter, as Italy remained flat and German and French economies shrunk. However, the UK economy fell short of the 0.6% growth in the United States. In light of these economic developments, Scott Gardner, investment strategist at JP Morgan-owned wealth manager Nutmeg, told Reuters on February 13, 2025:.""A pleasant surprise, but we're not out of the woods yet. Beneath the surface of these latest figures, domestic demand via consumption and business investment was weaker than expected,"".As per Britain’s Office for National Statistics, wholesalers, film distributors, pubs and bars, industrial manufacturers, and pharma led the growth in December 2024. However, it should be noted that this growth was dependent on monetary support from the government and a brief pile-up in business inventories. In addition, flat spending trends were observed in households, and business investment stumbled by 3.2% in Q4. The Bank of England has now slashed its growth outlook for 2025 to 0.75%, while the National Institute of Economic and Social Research remains optimistic with a 1.5% forecast..Investor optimism is increasing around the UK, given the rising trade tensions between the United States and Europe. While UK economic growth has lagged in recent years, BofA analysts expect it to pick up pace in 2025, projecting 1.4% growth. Analysts see positive signs like deregulation, capital spending, and potential US trade benefits.

Moving forward with Lake Charles LNG would meaningfully enhance and extend Energy Transfer's long-term growth outlook, adding a lot more fuel to grow its high-yielding distribution (nearly 8% at the current yield).  It was more than 10 years ago when Energy Transfer first proposed converting its existing natural gas import terminal in Lake Charles into an LNG export terminal with nearly 16.5 million tons per year of LNG production and export capacity.","Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) has been working to convert its Lake Charles facility in Louisiana from natural gas imports to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal for many years. The midstream giant has faced many obstacles along the road, which have delayed this project. .However, the master limited partnership (MLP) recently took a significant step in that key project. Moving forward with Lake Charles LNG would meaningfully enhance and extend Energy Transfer's long-term growth outlook, adding a lot more fuel to grow its high-yielding distribution (nearly 8% at the current yield)..It was more than 10 years ago when Energy Transfer first proposed converting its existing natural gas import terminal in Lake Charles into an LNG export terminal with nearly 16.5 million tons per year of LNG production and export capacity. It was initially working with BG Group on the project. Global LNG giant Shell (NYSE: SHEL) became its 50/50 joint venture partner in 2016 after closing its acquisition of BG Group. .However, Shell abandoned the project in 2020 due to the pandemic's impact on the global LNG market. That led Energy Transfer to continue developing the project on its own. Shell would eventually return to the project as a customer in 2022 by signing a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for 2.1 million tons of LNG per year. .Energy Transfer has spent several years working to receive the necessary government approvals for the project. It has also continued to sign up customers to commercialize the facility. On top of that, it has been looking for new partners to help fund a portion of the project. .After many years and lots of setbacks, Energy Transfer has finally found a partner to help it develop Lake Charles LNG. It announced this week that it had signed an agreement with MidOcean Energy, an LNG company formed and managed by leading institutional investor EIG, to jointly develop the facility. MidOcean Energy will fund 30% of the project cost in exchange for 30% of the LNG production. .Energy Transfer's agreement with MidOcean Energy is a significant step forward for this project. MidOcean Energy will be an investor in the facility and a meaningful customer, receiving 30% of the LNG produced from the facility, or about 5 million tons per year. It joins the likes of Shell, Chevron, which signed a 20-year deal for 2 million tons per year last December, and other customers in the project. With a significant percentage of the LNG capacity under contract, Energy Transfer should have enough commercial contracts to make a positive Final Investment Decision (FID) on the project.

2025-04-11 18:46:00,"Trump Revokes Shell, BP Gas Licenses for Offshore Venezuela","The Trump administration has revoked Shell and BP's Venezuela gas licenses, escalating a crackdown that began with Chevron and now threatens Trinidad's energy security.","The Trump Administration has escalated its crackdown on Venezuela’s oil and gas industry, revoking key licenses for international energy majors, including Shell plc SHEL, BP plc BP and Chevron Corporation CVX. These licenses had previously allowed operations in offshore Venezuelan gas fields and the export of resources to neighboring Trinidad and Tobago..The move affects two major gas projects — Shell’s involvement in the Dragon gas field and BP’s role in the Cocuina-Manakin project. Both projects were considered critical for boosting energy security in the Caribbean region and maintaining stable natural gas supplies for Trinidad and Tobago..This comes shortly after the administration revoked Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela and halted license provisions for other European players in February this year as part of a broader policy tightening on the Maduro-led regime..While the revocation curtails Shell’s immediate plans in Venezuela, the impact on its global portfolio is limited. Shell’s strength in LNG markets, particularly in Qatar, Australia, and the United States, continues to generate resilient cash flows. Its Dragon project, expected to begin exports to Trinidad — Latin America’s largest LNG exporter — in 2026, hadnot yet started production. As a result, its removal primarily delays long-term output rather than impairing current revenues..Moreover, Shell’s commitment to capital discipline, its growing renewable assets and buyback programs support a positive long-term outlook. The company has maintained robust upstream performance despite geopolitical headwinds, making SHEL a stock worth holding through the turbulence. SHEL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Developments associated with RPC Inc. RES, Equinor ASA EQNR and Matador Resources Company MTDR also grabbed attention.Overall, it was a catastrophic seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures plunged more than 10% to close at $61.99 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell some 6% to end at $3.837 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).The crude price — pressured by mounting recession concerns and an unexpected move by OPEC+ to speed up the rollback of production cuts — fell to its lowest level since 2021. Meanwhile, the drop in natural gas prices can be linked to mild weather forecasts and concerns that countries hit by President Trump’s new tariffs may retaliate by cutting U.S. LNG imports, reducing overall demand..1.    ExxonMobil hinted that higher commodity prices for oil and natural gas will likely positively impact its first-quarter 2025 earnings. Additionally, increased oil refining margins are expected to boost its first-quarter earnings. The energy major forecast an increase in earnings of $900 million from the previous quarter.In the first quarter, Brent crude prices came in at an average of $74.98 per barrel, suggesting a 1.3% increase quarter over quarter. However, year over year, the benchmark price witnessed an approximate decrease of 9%. Natural gas prices in the United States were approximately 30% higher in first-quarter 2025 from the fourth quarter of 2024.Being one of the largest energy firms in the United States, ExxonMobil’s earnings snapshot is closely followed by analysts to understand the broader industry performance. In an SEC filing, ExxonMobil hinted that stronger oil refining margins should contribute an additional $300-$700 million to its earnings relative to the previous quarter. (ExxonMobil Expects Earnings Boost in Q1 From Higher Commodity Prices)2.    Shell, one of the world’s leading energy companies, recently revised its liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production outlook for the first quarter of 2025. This update comes as a result of severe weather disruptions, specifically cyclones, and unexpected maintenance issues at its facilities in Australia.In the first-quarter 2025 update note, Shell projected LNG output to fall within a range of 6.4-6.8 million metric tons. This represents a decrease from its prior outlook of 6.6-7.2 million tons, highlighting the challenges faced by the company in maintaining consistent production levels.Shell’s production cut is primarily attributed to the adverse weather conditions that have been impacting its operations in Australia.

2025-04-08 18:34:00,Shell Cuts Q1 LNG Production Outlook Ahead of Financial Results,"SHEL revises its first-quarter LNG production estimate to 6.4-6.8 million tons, reflecting a reduction ahead of its financial results release on May 2.","Shell plc SHEL, one of the world’s leading energy companies, recently revised its liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production outlook for the first quarter of 2025. This update comes as a result of severe weather disruptions, specifically cyclones, and unexpected maintenance issues at its facilities in Australia..In first-quarter 2025 update note, the London-based integrated oil and gas company now projects LNG output to fall within a range of 6.4-6.8 million metric tons for the first quarter. This represents a decrease from its prior outlook of 6.6-7.2 million tons, highlighting the challenges faced by the company in maintaining consistent production levels..Shell’s production cut is primarily attributed to the adverse weather conditions that have been impacting its operations in Australia. The company pointed to the effects of cyclones and unplanned maintenance as key factors behind the revised outlook. The weather-related challenges in the region have created significant disruptions, particularly affecting SHEL’s Prelude floating LNG facility in Western Australia..In February 2025, SHEL acknowledged the need to postpone some loading activities due to these ongoing weather difficulties. As a result, production has not been able to meet the anticipated targets, prompting the company to scale back its expectations for the first quarter..Despite the setback in LNG production, SHEL’s gas division trading results are expected to remain in line with the previous quarter, indicating that the overall financial performance from this segment may not see a drastic deviation. However, the production shortfall highlights the vulnerability of energy companies like SHEL to external factors, including natural disasters and equipment failures, which can cause substantial disruptions to their operations..Alongside the downward revision for LNG production, SHEL also adjusted its outlook for the integrated gas division. The company now expects output to be in the band of 910,000-950,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“boe/d”), down from the previous range of 930,000-990,000 boe/d. This reduction is again linked to unplanned maintenance, particularly in the region of Australia, which has limited the company’s capacity to achieve its original output targets. The company’s proactive measures to address these operational challenges, however, have helped ensure that the impact on overall financial performance remains somewhat controlled.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-cuts-q1-lng-production-103400718.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk
