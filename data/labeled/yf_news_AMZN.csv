2025-06-27 05:09:00,Nvidia rally persists: What worries this analyst about AI trade,"Nvidia (NVDA) climbs higher, hitting fresh record highs. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers have underperformed other AI-related names in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), like Palantir (PLTR), Vistra (VST), and Dell (DELL). Wall Street Horizon head of corporate event research, Christine Short, tells Market Domination host Josh Lipton, Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman, and Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer that it's competition with Chinese AI companies that she worries could threaten the AI play.

However, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers have underperformed other AI-related names in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), like Palantir (PLTR), Vistra (VST), and Dell (DELL)..Wall Street Horizon head of corporate event research, Christine Short, tells Market Domination host Josh Lipton, Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman, and Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer that it's competition with Chinese AI companies that she worries could threaten the AI play..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Green all over the place, Christine, we just keep grinding higher here. What do you make of it? .Yeah, look, investor appetite is there, right? AI enthusiasm has returned. We just talked about Nvidia. Um, I think there were some whispers today about is this, you know, signifying a bubble here? Is this .com 2.0 with Nvidia being at almost record highs here? And if you look at what analysts are saying, and I know we're going to hear from one, you know, that covers Nvidia here soon, um, no one's saying that this is overvalued. I think many are actually saying that we're still undervalued here on Nvidia because we haven't quite priced in AI and the impact on productivity. We heard from CEO of Salesforce today, Mark Benioff, saying that 30 to 50% of their workload is now done by AI. And we've seen a slew of companies cut, you know, positions because of AI, whether it be Salesforce or CrowdStrike, Klarna, so, or, or Duolingo, who's actually going to be more discreet about hiring because of AI. So I don't think we've, we've folded in the full impact. The one concern I have, and maybe it's not so much a concern, but what I'm watching is competition from Chinese AI companies. There was a great report in Datatrack Research earlier in the week that just showed the valuations are so much more appetizing on some of those Chinese AI names versus, you know, the US ones. And the returns have actually been higher for those names. So that's one area that I'm watching is, is the competition between us and those Chinese AI names. .Josh, you know, Julie mentioned it briefly, but I want to get double tap on it. The mag 7 names, Josh, those giants, right? How have they been working? .Yeah, yeah, Josh. So I have a visual representation over here on our big board, right, of sort of some of what Julie was talking about. And what I'm looking at here is just performance since the April 8th low. Uh, most of these stocks here are all in the top 20 of the S&P 500. They're all AI tied. So I looked at sort of an AI basket of stocks, right? You have Oracle, Broadcom, Dell, AMD, NRG, as Julie mentioned, Vistra, which is sort of an AI power play, and Palantir. What's interesting is all of the mag 7 have underperformed them, right? So Nvidia's up about 60% at a new high. Really the rest of these companies have come up about 25, 30% maybe from the bottom. Apple hasn't really gone anywhere. And Christine, I guess the question this sort of brings me to for you is just, is the next AI trade going to continue to be the broadening out of this trade into cloud computing, into energy, into some of the other chip names, or is that, is that sort of where it feels like this trade is headed as we go through kind of the second half of 25? .Yeah, I think we, we are already seeing that broadening out. There's a lot of liquidity in the market, and I think what surprised me the most is how quickly we've rebounded from that April low. And it just goes to show the appetite, the enthusiasm amongst, you know, all of tech. So not just within the AI space, but there is liquidity there. There was cash on the sidelines for quite a while. And now, you know, many of those investors bought the dip, and now we're seeing it rip.

Wolf told Fortune that today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions. “In science, asking the question is the hard part,” he said. “Once the question is asked, often the answer is quite obvious, but the tough part is really asking","Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face, has cast doubt on the belief that current artificial intelligence systems will lead to major scientific breakthroughs..Wolf told Fortune that today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions..“In science, asking the question is the hard part,” he said. “Once the question is asked, often the answer is quite obvious, but the tough part is really asking the question, and models are very bad at asking great questions.”.Don't Miss:.GoSun's breakthrough rooftop EV charger already has 2,000+ units reserved — become an investor in this $41.3M clean energy brand today..Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market. Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential..Wolf’s comments were in response to a blog post by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who argues that artificial intelligence could compress a century's worth of scientific breakthroughs into just a few years..Wolf said he initially found the post compelling but became skeptical after rereading. “It was saying AI is going to solve cancer, and it's going to solve mental health problems—it's going to even bring peace into the world. But then I read it again and realized there's something that sounds very wrong about it, and I don't believe that,” he told Fortune..San Francisco-based Anthropic is backed by tech giants, including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), and is also known for its Claude family of AI models..For Wolf, the core issue lies in how LLMs are trained. In another blog post, Wolf argues that today’s AI systems are built to predict likely outcomes, act as ""yes-men on servers,"" capable of mimicking human responses but incapable of challenging assumptions or generating original ideas..""To create an Einstein in a data center, we don't just need a system that knows all the answers, but rather one that can ask questions nobody else has thought of or dared to ask,"" Wolf wrote..He cited that real scientific progress often comes from paradigm shifts—like Copernicus proposing heliocentrism or the invention of CRISPR-based gene editing—rather than from answering existing questions..Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100..Wolf also questioned how AI performance is measured today. In his blog post, he pointed to benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam or Frontier Math, which test how well AI models can answer complex but well-defined questions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hugging-face-co-founder-challenges-040151444.html,Reputational Risk Operational Risk Market Risk

He also said he expected OpenAI to eventually list publicly..""I'm all in on OpenAI,"" Son said..SoftBank had owned around 5% of Nvidia until it sold the stake in 2019, before ChatGPT generated a surge in AI interest at the end of 2022. Nvidia now dominates AI chipmaking and has become one of the world's most valuable companies..Son's latest spending spree follows years of retrenchment after the high-growth tech startups into which SoftBank had invested billions of dollars through its Vision Fund investment vehicles crashed in value from 2022..Fortunes changed again when SoftBank raised some $5 billion listing chip designer Arm in September 2023. The rise in the British firm's share price since has boosted the group's assets, against which SoftBank can take out debt to fund new investment..Son said SoftBank was committed to prudent investment and that, throughout the peaks and troughs, SoftBank has maintained the financial resources and user base such that it can take risks at times..Earlier in June it raised $4.8 billion from the sale of some shares in T-Mobile..(Reporting by Anton Bridge; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Christopher Cushing)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-aiming-become-leading-artificial-021026565.html,Strategic Risk Reputational Risk Market Risk Technological Risk Financial Risk

He once said that he wakes up at three in the morning and goes:.""What an idiot.

Interestingly, he didn't even include Apple and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) in his ""Fantastic 40"" companies list..As per Kraken's price feed, Bitcoin was trading at $107,511.08 at press time, up 77% a year..Billionaire predicts 'Fantastic 40' companies by 2030, one surprise pick stands out first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 26, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 26, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-predicts-fantastic-40-companies-231000066.html,No risk.

This marks the second time the company has received this prestigious global honor. Flutterwave joins global leaders such as Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Netflix, OpenAI, Universal Music Group, and others in the list’s TITANS category.","Africa’s leading payments technology company returns to this global list after its 2021 debut..SAN FRANSCISCO, June 26, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Flutterwave, Africa’s leading payment technology company, has been named among the TIME100 Most Influential Companies List of 2025. This marks the second time the company has received this prestigious global honor. Flutterwave joins global leaders such as Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Netflix, OpenAI, Universal Music Group, and others in the list’s TITANS category..TIME reveals the fifth-annual TIME100 Most Influential Companies list, highlighting companies making an extraordinary impact around the world today. To assemble the list, TIME solicited nominations across sectors, and polled its global network of contributors and correspondents, as well as outside experts. Then TIME editors evaluated each on key factors, including impact, innovation, ambition, and success. The result is a diverse group of 105 businesses helping chart an essential path forward..Founded in 2016, Flutterwave was first included on the TIME100 list in 2021. This followed a historic campaign that helped thousands of businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to sell online. Its 2025 return testifies to the company’s ongoing influence as a fintech leader, transforming payments across Africa and beyond..The company has remained committed to connecting Africa through seamless payments. It empowers individuals and businesses to thrive in the digital economy. Today, its solutions power growth across diverse sectors. These include cross-border remittance, e-commerce, travel, payroll, and hospitality..Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola, commented on the recognition:.""Being recognized by TIME once again is a true honor. It's a testament to our team’s incredible work. We’ve moved from building infrastructure to enabling global-scale solutions. Flutterwave today isn't just powering payments; we’re shaping Africa's financial future and connecting the continent to the world."".In the past year, Flutterwave significantly expanded its global presence. The company now has technology reach in over 34 African countries. Nearly fifty percent of its customers received payments in new markets in 2024. Additionally, it launched operations in new markets such as Bahrain, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia for a leading global ride-hailing giant to expand in those countries. This positions Flutterwave as one of the few African fintech companies with such extensive technology reach..Additionally, the company’s flagship remittance product, SendApp by Flutterwave, has scaled rapidly across the US, UK, and the EU. It creates faster, more affordable ways for Africans in the diaspora to send money to family and friends back home. Notably, Send App received 20 additional licenses in the US, now holding 34 such licenses across the country. This, combined with partnerships, gave the brand near-complete US coverage. The company also built a strengthened executive team.

The internet is only a few decades old..Technological innovation has accelerated significantly since the early 2000s, with the internet playing a pivotal role in paving the way for cloud computing. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as the next growth frontier for investors. The companies leading the way have grown to immense size and scale, garnering the nickname the ""Magnificent Seven."".The exciting part is that it appears there is still a massive runway ahead for future innovation and the continuation of ongoing trends. Three companies stand out to me. They have become juggernauts and could be unstoppable technology leaders well into the future..Here are the three monster stocks you should consider investing in for the long term..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a huge impact since the push to build artificial intelligence infrastructure went into overdrive in late 2022. Companies continue to race to build massive data centers with thousands of the company's GPU accelerator chips. It started with Nvidia's Hopper microarchitecture and has since evolved into Blackwell. According to IoT Analytics Research, Nvidia owns an estimated 92% of the AI data center GPU market..While data center spending continues to rip and roar in 2025, it's wise to think about AI's next innings. There is a good chance that computing resources will expand beyond data centers to localized areas where they can power new technologies, such as humanoid robotics or autonomous vehicles. Nvidia already has its eyes on these opportunities, fleshing out an ecosystem of hardware and developer tools that will entice companies to build on its platform..Many of the companies building all these data centers continue to struggle with capacity constraints, so it doesn't seem that Nvidia's business will slow anytime soon. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 today. That may seem like a lot, but considering analysts estimate Nvidia will grow earnings by nearly 29% annualized over the long term, the reigning AI leader should continue to deliver for investors over the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-stocks-unstoppable-monsters-163400575.html,No risk.

Philomin left Amazon earlier in June..In his biography, Philomin said he helped create and lead Amazon Bedrock, a hub for using multiple AI models and one of AWS's premier products in its battle for AI supremacy. He was a frequent speaker at AWS events, including Amazon's annual cloud computing conference in Las Vegas. An Amazon spokesman noted that there are other vice presidents at AWS who also work on generative AI projects..Amazon is working to bolster its reputation in AI development, after rivals like OpenAI, and Google have taken an early lead, particularly with consumer-focused models..The Seattle-based online retailer and technology powerhouse has invested $8 billion in AI startup Anthropic and integrated its Claude software into its own products including a new revamped version of voice assistant Alexa that it's rolling out to customers this year..In December, Amazon introduced its Nova AI models which provide for text, video and image generation. Earlier this year, it added to the lineup with a version called Sonic that can more readily produce natural-sounding speech..Companies are employing creative techniques to hire top AI talent, including using sports industry data analysis to help identify undiscovered talent, Reuters reported last month. As a result, compensation has skyrocketed for some..However, as Amazon races to produce more advanced AI, it said it expects its own success will lead to fewer corporate jobs, according to a memo from CEO Andy Jassy last week. Job growth limits will be driven in particular by so-called agentic AI, which can perform tasks with minimal or even no additional input from people..""As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today and more people doing other types of jobs,"" Jassy wrote..(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by David Gregorio)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-amazon-loses-aws-generative-155610909.html,Operational Risk Reputational Risk Talent Risk
2025-06-26 23:31:00,Will Microsoft's AI Services Help Maintain Its Cloud Growth Momentum?,MSFT rides on a surge in AI-driven Azure adoption as custom agents and new MU model push cloud growth even higher.,"Microsoft MSFT has been expanding its Azure platform and AI services to support the growing demand for intelligent tools and automation. The company continues to integrate AI into its offerings. These offerings are built on Azure infrastructure and help organizations create and deploy their own AI agents. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, over 10,000 organizations had used Agent Service, and more than 1 million custom agents were created across Microsoft platforms, up 130% quarter over quarter. Microsoft also processed more than 100 trillion tokens in the quarter, up 5 times year over year..Recently, Microsoft introduced the MU language model, which now powers the new AI agent in Windows 11 Settings. The agent allows users to interact with system settings using natural language. The technology, which is powered by Azure AI, shows how Microsoft is using its AI services to power real-world features across its ecosystem..The launch of the MU model and its integration into Windows is expected to increase usage of Azure’s AI tools and services. As more users and organizations adopt these agent-based features, Azure cloud consumption is likely to rise. This supports Microsoft’s ongoing focus on bringing AI into mainstream productivity and enterprise workflows..In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment generated $26.8 billion in revenues, up 21% year over year. It accounted for 37.9% of MSFT’s total revenues. Azure and other cloud services grew 33%, with AI services contributing 16 percentage points to that growth. Our model estimate for the Intelligent Cloud segment’s revenues in fiscal 2025 is pegged at $105.3 billion, indicating 20.4% growth year over year..Microsoft is facing tough competition from Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, ramping up agentic AI efforts.Amazon’s AWS is making it easier to build agentic AI with tools like Agents for Bedrock, AWS App Studio and Amazon Q that help developers create AI agents that work across apps and data. With built-in support for orchestration and reasoning, Amazon’s AWS is becoming a strong platform for next-gen AI tools..Alphabet’s Google Cloud is pushing into agentic AI with tools like Agent Builder. With built-in orchestration and support for Gemini models, Alphabet is making agent development faster and more accessible for real-world use..MSFT shares have gained 17.7% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 13.5% and 4.5%, respectively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-services-help-maintain-153100201.html,No risk.

The company continues to benefit from its regional fulfillment network, which allows it to place inventory closer to customers. This has enabled faster deliveries, often in fewer packages and at lower delivery costs. In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon set new delivery speed records for Prime members and delivered more items the same or next day than in any other quarter in its history.Amazon recently announced plans to expand the convenience and reliability of Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery to tens of millions of U.S. customers in more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns and rural communities by the end of 2025. The company is investing more than $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026, with a focus on expanding coverage in less densely populated regions. This move is aimed at improving access for rural customers and enhancing delivery speed for a wider customer base.As of June 2025, the number of items delivered the same or next day in the United States rose more than 30% year over year. With the upcoming expansion of its delivery network, Amazon is positioned to increase the volume of ultra-fast deliveries even further. The plans are expected to support continued growth in shipping speed and reliability, reinforcing the company’s online store performance.Amazon’s Online Stores segment generated $57.4 billion in revenues in the first quarter of 2025, up 5% year over year. This segment accounted for 36.9% of Amazon’s total quarterly revenues.

2025-06-26 22:17:00,SoundHound AI vs. Cerence: Which Voice AI Stock Holds More Promise?,"SOUN and CRNC battle for voice AI dominance, but only one is scaling fast across sectors beyond autos with strong momentum.","Voice-driven artificial intelligence is emerging as a key battleground in tech, and SoundHound AI, Inc. SOUN and Cerence Inc. CRNC have positioned themselves at the forefront of this niche. SoundHound is a newer entrant leveraging its conversational voice platform across industries from automotive to restaurants, while Cerence is an established leader in in-car voice assistants for automakers. Both companies operate in the voice AI space, and a comparison is timely as generative AI amplifies demand for voice interfaces.Despite their common focus on voice AI, SoundHound and Cerence differ in scope and strategy. SoundHound’s technology spans multiple industries, powering voice ordering in restaurants and voice-enabled customer service, in addition to automotive voice assistants. In contrast, Cerence is focused on the mobility market, supplying voice assistant software to nearly every major car OEM. The broader market reach of SoundHound compared to Cerence’s auto specialization sets the stage for an intriguing comparison. Let’s analyze which voice AI stock offers better upside potential now..SoundHound has emerged as a leader in voice AI by combining advanced speech recognition with large language models to power natural, voice-based interactions. Its Polaris AI engine delivers fast, accurate responses — even in noisy settings — supporting applications across industries. The company’s acquisitions of SYNQ3, Amelia and Allset have expanded its capabilities in restaurant ordering, customer service and voice commerce. Now operating with a three-pronged strategy — enterprise agents, automotive assistants and voice commerce —SoundHound is gaining traction among automakers and tech firms. Its innovation pace and platform versatility position it as a strong independent player in the voice AI space.SoundHound’s broad industry reach opens up significant growth potential. It’s gaining traction in restaurants, with voice ordering in nearly 13,000 locations, and in automotive, powering voice AI for more than 20 car brands. Its enterprise solutions are used by top global banks, reflecting strong B2B adoption. This diversification limits dependence on any single customer. As generative AI demand grows, SoundHound’s independent, brand-friendly platform appeals to companies wary of Big Tech. Partnerships with firms like Lucid Motors and NVIDIA extend its footprint into luxury EVs and edge AI. Overall, SoundHound is well-positioned to scale across multiple high-growth sectors.SoundHound’s first-quarter 2025 results highlight strong momentum, with revenues surging 151% year over year to $29.1 million, driven by organic growth and recent acquisitions. Key contributions came from restaurant and enterprise voice AI solutions, supporting diversification. While the GAAP gross margin fell to 37% due to integration costs, the adjusted gross margin stood at 51%, with management targeting margin improvements over the next 18 to 24 months. The company posted a non-GAAP net loss of $22.3 million but remains well-capitalized, holding $246 million in cash and no debt. The full-year revenue guidance of $157-$177 million implies a near doubling, and SoundHound is targeting adjusted EBITDA breakeven by year-end, signaling a focus on scaling efficiently toward profitability.Despite operational momentum, SoundHound faces formidable competition from deep-pocketed tech giants. Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL dominate the AI-powered voice assistant market. Google Assistant powers Android Automotive and is well integrated into in-car experiences globally. Amazon’s Alexa, backed by AWS and a large developer community, is expanding into vehicles and has an entrenched smart home base. Apple’s Siri benefits from tight integration across its ecosystem, especially via iPhones and CarPlay. These larger players — Alphabet, Amazon and Apple — could leverage their ecosystems to challenge SoundHound’s growth. Another risk is the company’s heavy spend on R&D and marketing (up 66% year over year due to acquisitions), which must eventually translate into sustainable customer wins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhound-ai-vs-cerence-voice-141700782.html,Market Risk Competitive Risk

NVDA — the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) — regained the crown of the world’s most valuable company in terms of market capital..On June 25, the stock price of NVDA closed at an all-time high of $154.31, with a market capital of $3.763 trillion, surpassing one of its major client Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT market capital of around $3.66 trillion..NVIDIA recorded its previous all-time high of $149.41 at January end. Thereafter, the stock fell significantly due to the unveiling of the low-cost Chinese DeepSeek AI platform, the Trump administration’s decision to stop the export of NVDA’s high-end H20 AI processor to China and global turmoil related to trade after President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs..The stock price recorded its recent low in early April. From there, it surged nearly 80% with a year-over-year gain of more than 15%.

Since respondents could select all concerns that applied to them, the percentages reflect overlapping worries rather than a total of 100% - underscoring how travel-related stress is often multi-layered. For many, the stress begins before the vacation even starts, with over half (52%) saying their concerns kick in either as soon as they leave their property or while they are traveling..""It’s eye-opening to learn that the majority of people worry about what’s happening back home before they’ve even fully settled into their vacation,"" said Mimi Swain, Chief Commercial Officer at Ring. ""Vacations should be a time to relax, disconnect, and not think about what’s happening at home or what could go wrong."".The emotional toll is clear: 78% of respondents say these home-related worries affect their ability to relax, with over a quarter (27%) reporting a significant impact..And it’s not all hypothetical – 42% of Americans report having had a home-related issue that actually disrupted their holiday, such as break-ins, property damage, or other security incidents. Notably, over 15% report that this has happened to them multiple times..When asked how they try to alleviate these concerns, the most common method was asking a friend, neighbor, or family member to check in (58%). However, many are already turning to tech – 40% trust smart home devices or security cameras, and 36% check in on their property remotely through an app or video doorbell. Since respondents could select multiple methods, these approaches often overlap, reflecting how people are layering technology to feel more secure while away from home..This growing reliance on connected technology reflects a major shift in how homeowners manage peace of mind from afar. And the data speaks for itself – 75% agree that being able to check in on their home virtually would make it easier to relax while on vacation..""With home security being one of the top concerns, there are simple things you can do to give yourself peace of mind, and leave the stress at home,"" said Swain. ""Installing a video doorbell or security cameras around the house will help keep your home protected. I also go the extra step and have Ring Alarm and use Virtual Security Guard to have a professional monitor our cameras.

Claude—whose latest iteration launched in May—has fewer monthly active users than OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But it’s beloved in some circles for its coding ability and creativity. Founded by OpenAI refugees who distrusted Sam Altman’s plan for monetizing AI, Amazon-backed Anthropic tries to balance growth and safety, pledging to not release updates to Claude until it has met strictly-defined internal safety requirements contained in the company’s “Responsible Scaling Policy.” That policy is voluntary and non-binding, but Anthropic Chief Scientist Jared Kaplan contends that it has pushed the AI industry in the right direction. “If our competitors see us doing this well, then they'll feel more incentivized to copy us,” he says..Disclosure: Investors in Anthropic include Salesforce, where TIME co-chair and owner Marc Benioff is CEO..Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-114350488.html,No risk.

Read on..There are two primary AI workloads: Training, which involves feeding truckloads of data into AI models to make them ""smarter,"" and inference, which is the process by which AI models use that data to formulate responses or make predictions.

Although it's still the third-largest company in the world, Microsoft and Nvidia have overtaken Apple, likely for good, as the growth these two are putting up far surpasses Apple's..However, I don't think we've seen the last of companies surpassing Apple in terms of market cap over the next few years. I think we'll see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surpass Apple by 2030. Several key factors play into this prediction, but Amazon's and Alphabet's performances aren't the only reason they'll surpass Apple..Apple's brand may be the most valuable on Earth, but that's about all it has going for it. Apple has posted anemic growth over the past few years, and it could be debated that Apple's growth has been essentially nonexistent when inflation is factored into the calculation..Despite that, Apple's stock trades like a hot growth stock, trading at 28 times forward earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 22.8 times forward earnings, with an average growth rate of about 10% per year. Apple's growth rate is far below that pace, so at most, Apple's stock should receive a market-average multiple, at least from my perspective..If Apple's valuation were to decline to a market-average multiple, it would tumble nearly 20%. That would put Apple's market cap at around $2.44 trillion, which is where we'll start our comparison..Currently, Amazon's market cap is $2.23 trillion and Alphabet's is $2.03 trillion. That's not far from the $2.44 trillion that I think Apple should be trading at, but even if Apple's stock stays at its elevated level, I think these two can catch Apple by 2030..Let's start with Amazon, whose growth rate looks rather slow at first glance, similar to Apple's..However, that's the wrong way to look at Amazon's stock. Amazon can be split into two businesses: commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing. While the consumer-facing commerce division is widely known and what most people value the stock for, the real cash cow is AWS. In the first quarter, AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating profits despite making up just 19% of revenue.

The newly-launched start-up has agreed partnerships with over 100 brands such as Amazon, Nike and Starbucks, enabling customers to donate up to 10 percent of every transaction to good causes..""If British shoppers spend what they normally do with our partners, over £100 million could flow to UK charities this Summer, without anyone spending a penny extra,"" said Sam Kopelman, Givr's co-founder and CEO. .The ""Pay Now, Give Now"" revolution.Most of us know ""Buy-now, Pay-later"" where you split payments into installments. Givr uses the opposite logic to make charity giving easy. You preload shopping credit (say, £50 at Amazon) in the app and spend it whenever convenient. Since the brand receives cash upfront, this smooths operations and avoids fees. In return, up to 10% is donated to your chosen charity..""It's incredible that I can raise funds with my regular shopping,"" said Laura Garland, frequent supporter of British Heart Foundation. ""I've already raised £5.50 in 3 days""..The Comeback Story .The UK was once the most generous nation among major economies (CAF World Giving Index), but today it ranks 22nd. With the cost of living crisis squeezing household budgets, charitable giving has understandably declined and the proportion of UK donors has dropped from 58% in 2019 to just 50% now, a loss of nearly 4 million supporters..Givr wants to change that..By enrolling 1 million shoppers by the end of 2025 - and encouraging other retailers to follow its donation model - Givr could help raise an additional £5 billion for UK charities.

Still, there are investments you can make that are more likely to do better than others because the companies have significant competitive advantages over their peers..Three stocks that fit this description right now are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B). Here's why each one is worth considering when building a long-lasting portfolio..Amazon stock may not get as much attention these days as some high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, but the company's dominance in both e-commerce and cloud computing -- along with its expanding advertising business -- should push Amazon to the top of your buy list..First, consider that Amazon has about 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, easily outpacing its next closest competitor, Walmart, which has just over 6% of the market. Amazon has little to worry about as well, with the company currently having about 180 million Prime members in the U.S., who enjoy free shipping and a long list of free services like music and video streaming..And that's not where Amazon's market lead ends. The company is also the largest cloud computing player, with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. AWS brought in $11.5 billion in operating income for Amazon in the first quarter, nearly double what the company's U.S. e-commerce platform earned..What's more, Amazon has become an advertising juggernaut. Ad sales reached nearly $14 billion in the first quarter, up 18%. Amazon enjoys a unique position in the ad space because its sales come from sellers placing ads directly on its e-commerce platform or through its video streaming service. This makes its ad revenue the icing on the cake for its already lucrative services..Costco makes it on this list because the company consistently offers value to its customers -- and they keep coming back for more. Costco has 140.6 million cardholders right now, an increase of nearly 7% from the same time last year, and its membership renewal is an enviable 93%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-could-create-lasting-071500658.html,No risk.

Each year, AWS plans to engage over 1,000 C-Suite leaders and business decision makers at the Hub on cloud and Gen AI technology-led innovation, and will provide 200 students from Singapore's tertiary education institutions an exclusive learning experience at the facility. The virtual and physical demos of existing and new technology solutions are co-built with AWS partners and customers to address top business challenges and can already be adopted by companies in the region. .The AWS Innovation Hub builds on AWS's existing innovation offerings around the world such as the AWS Builders Studio in Melbourne where customers connect with AWS technologists to build, experiment, validate, and test prototypes before scaling. AWS also supports customers to accelerate their generative AI innovation through global initiatives, such as the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, where AWS's expert AI scientists and strategists bring deep industry and AI expertise to guide customers across the full AI lifecycle from ideation to enterprise-wide scale.

The law of large numbers may be a reason why overall revenue growth is in the single digits.  A surprisingly low valuation could help boost Amazon stock longer term.,"Online sales growth does not have a significant effect on Amazon's overall performance..The law of large numbers may be a reason why overall revenue growth is in the single digits..A surprisingly low valuation could help boost Amazon stock longer term..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Investors who have followed Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) for a long time are aware of its path to megacap status. What started as an online bookselling business that pioneered e-commerce has evolved into a tech conglomerate with a $2.2 trillion market cap..While that is a testament to the company's rock-solid business model, it also presents a challenge. Companies that reach such a size tend to grow more slowly, not because of deficiencies in the business model, but instead due to the law of large numbers..Nonetheless, Amazon is still on track to continue beating the market. Here's why its days of growth are far from over..Indeed, Amazon's size does not work to its advantage in some respects. As mentioned, higher-percentage growth is harder for large companies to achieve. Moreover, Amazon's largest, most well-known enterprise, online sales, grew its revenue by 6% annually, and it is unclear whether it turns a profit for the company..Fortunately, that business is also well-positioned to serve as a loss leader for other enterprises under Amazon's e-commerce umbrella. Selling digital advertising on the sales site has become a lucrative endeavor, as the $14 billion in revenue it generated in Q1 rose 19% year over year. Subscription services, which includes Amazon Prime, surged 11% higher over the same period to nearly $12 billion..Still, Amazon's primary growth driver stems from the second industry it pioneered: cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated over $29 billion in Q1 revenue. It accounted for 19% of the company's revenue and grew 17% compared to 12 months prior..Additionally, AWS accounted for nearly $12 billion of the more than $18 billion in operating income the company generated in Q1. That strength affords Amazon the opportunity to stay at the forefront of tech by investing in advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI)..Furthermore, it means its retailing does not have to earn a profit, better enabling Amazon to compete against retail giants like Walmart and Costco..Thus, in Q1, the company's overall revenue of nearly $156 billion was 9% above year-ago levels, influenced in part by the aforementioned law of large numbers. In comparison, Amazon's operating expenses grew 7% over the same period.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-amazon-stock-beat-market-222700128.html,No risk.

That mindset isn’t limited to billionaires — it’s available to anyone with a plan..Here are three tips to diversifying like a billionaire in the fashion Bezos’s side gigs..This means investing early and often, according to Mory Traore, founder of Bank Statement Conversion, so you don’t have to rely solely on one income from one job to grow your wealth..“Just as Bezos used Amazon to fund other ventures, your 9-to-5 can be your springboard. Put some of your income into index funds, ETFs or dividend-paying stocks.

The analyst believes that the upcoming 2025-2026 auction might clear at the $325/MW-day cap, which can act as a near-term catalyst. With the current market momentum favoring acquirers, mainly with Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN)’s story and equity value fueled by the AWS deal, the company’s M&A potential has been adding to the upside, according to Raymond James..An agricultural field full of solar panels, capturing the sun's energy for the company..As per the terms of a new power purchase agreement, Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN) plans to supply electricity to Amazon for operations supporting AI and other cloud technologies at Amazon’s data center campus adjacent to Susquehanna, with the capability to deliver to other sites across Pennsylvania. Under the expanded PPA, at the full contract quantity, Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN) will offer Amazon 1,920 megawatts of carbon-free nuclear power through 2042, with options to further extend the duration. The power delivery schedule is expected to ramp over time, projecting to achieve full volume no later than 2032..Prosper Stars & Stripes, a long/short equity fund, recently released its Q1 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:.“Talen Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:TLN) was the top contributor in the long book during the first quarter of 2025. Talen is an independent power producer (“IPP”) with 10.7 gigawatts (“GW”) of power producing assets in the 13 state mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. called the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (“PJM”) market. As mentioned in previous letters, the company’s crown jewel asset is the 2.2 GW Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Talen signed a long-term power purchase agreement (“PPA”) with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for a total of 960 megawatts (“MW”). The first phase for up to 300 MW of power is in place; however, the additional phases are under review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Given the demand for clean energy and artificial intelligence (“AI”) datacenters, we believe a positive resolution is likely, as the dispute centers on interconnect costs and grid reliability. There are only 3.6 GW of new gas-fired generation projects expected to come online by 2030 in the PJM market. Based on management’s demand forecasts, this is not enough capacity to meet the expected needs of the market. Talen reached an agreement to extend the lives of its reliability-must-run (“RMR”) assets Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner to the end of the decade rather than ceasing operations in May 2025. These assets will receive fixed payments totaling $180 million annually for the life of the contract. RMR assets are designed to ensure there are fewer or no blackouts when the grid is stressed. We believe the scarcity value of Talen’s assets, financial stewardship of its balance sheet and cash flows, and equity valuation support our price target of approximately $300 per share.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-initiates-coverage-talen-203037851.html,Market Risk Regulatory Risk Financial Risk

Businesses that had supply chains rooted in China, like Shein, Temu and Amazon, all used de minimis to ship goods into the U.S. tax-free via air freight before the Trump administration banned the provision as of May 2..The bilateral China-to-U.S. lane represents around 2.5 percent of consolidated revenue at FedEx and is the company’s most profitable intercontinental lane, said chief financial officer John Dietrich..The headwinds have been reflected in FedEx’s first quarter guidance with range of flat revenue to 2 percent revenue growth, and an adjusted earnings per share range between $3.40 and $4.

""Tesla is still the most transformative company in autos,"" analysts led by Alexander Potter wrote. ""Over time, Tesla will likely win."".The report also warns that as self-driving tech scales, the broader auto market is at risk of major disruption, including fewer vehicles sold, higher utilization of fleets, and a shift toward service-based revenue models. Piper Sandler said Tesla could become a consolidator and identified no other winners in the space..Tesla is not the first player in the autonomous race. Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo launched its driverless taxis in Phoenix in 2018 and now operates fleets in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin. Amazon's Zoox began testing on public roads in 2023. Tesla opened its robotaxi service to limited riders in Austin this Sunday..The company also has several competitors in China. Baidu (BIDU) launched its robotaxi fleet in 2022 and reportedly has plans to expand in Europe..Piper Sandler analysts said other US automakers are falling behind as the future of mobility evolves. GM (GM) and Ford (FORD) are still lagging on software, while Rivian (RIVN) faces execution risks.

Currently, top analysts’ recommendations could go either way. Let’s take a closer look..Amazon delivered a solid performance last year and currently its stocks are trading at a reasonable valuation. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising will be the growth driver going forward and here are a few takeaways from AMZN as of June 24, 2025:.Stock price: $213.47.Market cap: $2.27 trillion.52-week high: $242.52.52-week low: $151.61.As for many retailers, Trump’s tariff policies have driven Walmart to raise prices. However, the big-box company is finding sales success in high-margin areas, such as digital advertising. Here are a few stats about WMT as of June 24, 2025:.Stock price: $98.96.Market cap: $789.74 billion.52-week high: $105.30.52-week low: $66.55.Be Aware: Suze Orman: 3 Biggest Mistakes You Can Make as an Investor.Walmart is the leading retail giant, but its e-commerce sales are falling short. Amazon is in a league of its own regarding e-commerce sales. It commands a staggering 37.6% of all U.S. e-commerce sales, leaving Walmart a distant second with a mere 6.4%..This significant gap is a testament to Amazon’s prowess and ability to leverage the growing e-commerce trend, gradually eroding Walmart’s lead in overall retail sales..Edge: Amazon.Amazon’s success is not limited to e-commerce. It is strategically capitalizing on its AI investment, which is bolstering its stocks. The company has introduced various generative AI tools that could revolutionize its clients’ operations. This innovative approach attracts a growing list of high-profile customers, indicating years of untapped potential for Amazon..Edge: Amazon.The bottom line is that Walmart and Amazon offer investors different incentives and are both solid choices for buying stocks. Like Walmart, Amazon is a low-risk investment with a reliable profit, but it also has a leading edge with ground-breaking AI advances the company is moving toward. However, Walmart’s stability may be a more attractive dividend for those with lower risk tolerance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-vs-walmart-stock-better-202010440.html,No risk.
2025-06-25 21:00:00,Ring cameras and doorbells now use AI to provide specific descriptions of motion activity,Ring gets a new AI-powered feature that offers users specific text descriptions of current motion activity.,"Amazon-owned Ring announced on Wednesday that it’s introducing a new AI-powered feature to its doorbells and cameras, which offers users specific text descriptions of current motion activity..Now, when users receive real-time notifications about happenings at their property, the updates will be more descriptive. For instance, “A person is walking up the steps with a black dog,” or “Two individuals are looking into a white car parked in the driveway.”.The feature aims to improve upon the vague notifications that were previously available. Users will be able to know exactly what is happening and can quickly decide whether it requires immediate attention. It should be noted that the AI only describes the first few seconds of the motion-activated video clip..The feature is being rolled out today as an English-only beta for Ring Home Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Users can choose to disable the feature by going to settings in the Ring app..According to a blog post by Jamie Siminoff, Ring’s founder and now Amazon’s VP of home security, the company plans to introduce additional AI features. One of these combines several motion events happening in and around a home into a single alert..Ring also intends to implement a “custom anomaly alert” that allows users to define what constitutes an anomaly for their property, enabling the camera to notify them when such an event occurs..Additionally, Siminoff mentioned that Ring will “learn your routine,” so it can inform users when something is out of the ordinary. This may be unsettling for some users, especially considering Ring’s past privacy concerns..“We are just starting to scratch the surface of AI. I feel like we are back to the very early days of Ring again — I see unlimited potential for new experiences we can invent for our neighbors,” Siminoff wrote..This announcement follows the recent launch of Ring’s AI-powered search feature, which enables users to locate specific moments within video recordings.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ring-cameras-doorbells-now-ai-130000924.html,Privacy Risk Reputational Risk Operational Risk Legal/Compliance Risk

Amazon stands to benefit from two game-changing forms of technology.  As of this writing, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) holds the top year-to-date performance of any stock within the Nasdaq 100.","The rise in Spotify's gross margins shows the company's business model is working..Amazon stands to benefit from two game-changing forms of technology..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.As of this writing, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) holds the top year-to-date performance of any stock within the Nasdaq 100. Yet, perhaps the time has come for investors to look elsewhere..Here are two alternative technology stocks that investors may want to consider..First up is Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT)..Up 64% year to date, Spotify is one of the year's best-performing stocks. The secret to its success is a combination of classic bullish fundamentals..Let's start with Spotify's business model. The company generates most of its revenue through its paid subscriber base. Thanks to its innovative audio platform, it managed to grow that paid subscriber base at a double-digit rate for several years. Spotify uses AI-powered features to build personalized playlists and introduce new music and artists. Consequently, that helps keep users happy and returning for more even as Spotify raised prices recently..Second, the company has gotten its costs under control. Gross margins have risen to 31%, the highest ever for the company -- significantly above its lifetime average of 26%. Similarly, after years of struggling to turn a consistent profit, Spotify generated $1.3 billion in net income over the last 12 months. The aforementioned price hikes -- along with a few rounds of layoffs -- have been the driving force behind the expansion in margins..Finally, there's the secular growth trend of streaming. People all over the world love to stream. Given the obvious convenience, relatively low cost, and nearly endless content available, hundreds of millions of people now subscribe to one or more streaming services. With broadband internet and 5G access continuing to expand worldwide, there's even more room for Spotify and other streamers to increase their subscriber bases for years to come..To sum up, Spotify is expanding its revenue base, cutting costs, and riding the secular growth of streaming to new heights. Investors would be wise to consider the stock right now..Then, there's Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)..Let's deal with this first: Amazon hasn't been the best tech stock to own over the last five years. During that time, the stock advanced by only 57%. That's less than what the S&P 500 generated (93%) over the same period..So, why do I think now is the time to consider Amazon? In short, it's because Amazon has several catalysts that should give the stock a boost over the next five to 10 years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-palantir-buy-2-tech-104500436.html,No risk.

More recently, Netflix stock dropped to a low of $166 per share in 2022 after increased competition led to subscriber losses, and Amazon's stock dipped under $82 per share at the start of 2023, when growth in AWS slowed.  Nike (NYSE: NKE) is currently experiencing a rough patch of its own.","When companies go through rough patches, there are often opportunities for investors..There are several recent examples of terrific opportunities to buy the dip..Nike is the latest that investors should consider buying before it turns around..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Sometimes iconic companies go through a rough patch -- Apple nearly going bankrupt in the late 1990s is perhaps the most extreme example. More recently, Netflix stock dropped to a low of $166 per share in 2022 after increased competition led to subscriber losses, and Amazon's stock dipped under $82 per share at the start of 2023, when growth in AWS slowed..Both stocks skyrocketed after ironing out the issues..Nike (NYSE: NKE) is currently experiencing a rough patch of its own. The stock is 66% off its 2022 high due to declining revenue. Tariffs, plunging consumer sentiment, and some anti-American sentiment regarding products internationally are thorns in Nike's side right now, but these are likely to subside in the long run. Nike is also profitable, cash flow positive, and on sound financial footing, paying a quality dividend yielding 2.6%. The time to buy this beaten-down stock could be now..Nike faces several challenges after some recent missteps by the company. The company is criticised for its lack of innovation and overreliance on popular legacy sneakers. Meanwhile, competition in the space is fierce. According to CEO Elliott Hill, product innovation is a major priority now. The company will reduce the inventory of its older models and introduce new products. One example is the high-performance Pagasus Premium shoe for runners. The initiative will be a challenge as Nike needs to create new products that sneaker lovers will gravitate to and market them effectively. Fortunately, Nike has extensive experience and a strong, long-term track record of success..Nike also overemphasized selling directly to consumers while neglecting retail partnerships. This reduced visibility and connection with customers. The consensus is that Nike vastly underestimated the value of retail shops. The CEO emphasized on the most recent earnings call that the company is reconnecting with its wholesalers, which should be a huge positive in the future..Nike produces a significant portion of its products in China, and the country is also a key market in which the company aims to expand its sales. Unfortunately, tariffs and geopolitical angst hurt costs and sales. The good news is that both the U.S. and China have incentives to come to a trade agreement soon, and Nike is actively focused on promoting its brand to the Chinese people. This is a terrific market for growth if Nike gets it right.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-investors-buy-stock-now-101500809.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Financial Risk

Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms each have market capitalizations of more than $1 trillion, and tend to dominate their markets and investors' attention..Don't get me wrong: All of those are solid investments. But it's also a good strategy for tech investors to look elsewhere for new opportunities. After all, companies like Palantir Technologies were barely a blip on the radar just a few years ago. But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems. And each has a market cap of less than $100 billion -- which means there's plenty of room for further growth and profit for your portfolio..DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) got its start in 2013, but it's one of those companies that really took off during the pandemic, as people were much more interested in eating at home than venturing out. That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives..The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns..DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms..If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE).

On June 20, Bloomberg reported that Amazon is discontinuing its experiment with same-day deliveries using Kia Soul vehicles, opting instead to rely on its existing network of gig-economy workers, primarily through the Amazon Flex program..The trial began rolling out in 2023 and involved Amazon contract delivery firms, known as Delivery Service Partners (DSPs), deploying drivers in four- or five-hour shifts using rented Kia Corp. hatchbacks in several US states, like Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. The objective of the Kia Soul program was to give Amazon more control over deliveries and potentially reduce its dependence on Amazon Flex drivers who utilize their own cars..A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping..However, Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly confirmed that after more than a year of gathering feedback from customers, DSPs, and teams at Same-Day Delivery facilities, the DSP model was determined not to be the right fit for Same-Day Delivery. The program will be phased out over the next few months, and the rental vehicles will be returned to their vendors. Amazon has stated it will support affected DSPs in operating other Amazon routes and assist drivers in finding jobs with other firms if needed..Amazon.com Inc.

To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia.   .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage.. .Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares.. .Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-vs-nvidia-ai-stock-161500955.html,Market Risk

Shares fell as much as 8.1% Tuesday, pausing the advance..Circle has been the main beneficiary of euphoria around stablecoin regulations as it is one of few publicly-traded companies with stablecoin-linked assets. But its continued upward trajectory is dependent on the adoption of the new technology..In mid-June, the US Senate passed legislation setting up regulations for the cryptocurrencies, which are pegged to the US dollar, in a landmark win for both the crypto industry and President Donald Trump, whose affiliated stablecoin with World Liberty Financial already boasts a roughly $2 billion market value.

Mastercard Inc. announced Tuesday a partnership with Fiserv to integrate stablecoin across the credit card company’s products and services. Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among companies discussing issuing their own stablecoins, pressuring shares of traditional payment companies such as Visa Inc..Even with the recent momentum, if stablecoins don’t become a widely-used and accepted payment method, there could be limited potential for Circle going forward..“We are highly skeptical stablecoins will ever be a relevant payment method in the US.

2025-06-24 21:31:00,Is the Rise of Stablecoins the End of Mastercard as We Know it?,MA's blockchain push and consumer perks may shield it from stablecoin threats shaking payment giants.,"Mastercard Incorporated MA appears well-equipped to navigate the potential disruption posed by stablecoins. Although major retailers such as Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins to reduce dependence on traditional payment networks and avoid interchange fees, the immediate threat to Mastercard’s core business remains limited..While stablecoins offer advantages like faster settlement and lower transaction costs, particularly in cross-border payments, they lack essential consumer benefits such as credit access, fraud protection and reward programs, areas where Mastercard holds a distinct competitive edge. In addition, widespread adoption of stablecoin-based payment systems faces considerable barriers, including trust deficits, infrastructure gaps and regulatory uncertainty..Importantly, Mastercard is not standing idle amid these changes. The company has already introduced initiatives like its Multi-Token Network and has piloted USDC settlements to integrate blockchain technology into its payment infrastructure. These efforts indicate that Mastercard aims to evolve its business model to incorporate stablecoin transactions rather than be displaced by them..Past technological shifts, such as the rise of mobile wallets, ultimately complemented rather than replaced traditional card networks, and a similar outcome may occur with stablecoins. Nevertheless, there are potential revenue risks if merchant-led stablecoin platforms gain faster traction than anticipated, especially in high-fee or cross-border segments..Overall, while stablecoins introduce new pricing pressures, Mastercard’s proactive innovation strategy and well-established consumer advantages suggest that the company is more likely to adapt and thrive alongside this emerging technology than face existential decline..Visa Inc. V and PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL are actively incorporating stablecoins into their operations to stay competitive in the evolving digital payment landscape. In 2020, Visa launched pilots using USDC for settling transactions on its network, enhancing cross-border payment efficiency by reducing costs and processing times. Visa is partnering with crypto wallets to enable stablecoin payments across its merchant network. Similarly, PayPal has launched its own stablecoin, PYUSD, built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to buy, sell, and transfer the token directly within its platform and on some external wallets. This move enhances transaction speed and reduces costs while strengthening PayPal’s presence in the blockchain and digital asset ecosystem.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rise-stablecoins-end-mastercard-know-133100127.html,No risk.

This shift places greater emphasis on fulfillment speed, inventory precision, and compliance, particularly as brands scale omnichannel distribution..While industry growth offers promise, an alarming rise in fraud and theft throughout the supply chain presents challenges for food & beverage brands.

The analysis also found that warehouses and distribution centers were the top location for theft incidents, as fraudsters use tactics ranging from deceptive pickups to exploitation of perimeter weakness to acquire millions of dollars of stolen goods.

Natalie Gordon started the baby registry Babylist in 2011 to serve customers like her. A former software engineer for Amazon, she was about to have her first child and started building a registry that met her needs. That helped Babylist distinguish itself as a destination for new parents of the early 2010s in a market where any registry for them was baby blue and pale pink, with cutesy cartoons they didn’t want to send around to friends and family. “I was our core user,” she remembers. “I was writing every single line of code. It was very easy to know what to build because I was building it for myself.”.Fourteen years later, with a 14-year-old at home, Gordon is no longer the core customer for the platform. It’s now a registry, an ecommerce destination for new parents, and an affiliate sales powerhouse—a profitable one that brings in more than $500 million in annual revenue, Fortune is the first to report. Gordon tells new hires at Babylist who don’t have kids that they’re closer to their core user—brand-new parents—than she is..The growth of Babylist to become a half-billion-dollar business has depended on reaching a broader market of parents. The platform has traditionally been a place for people to register for and buy everything from $29 baby bottles to a $1,399 gliding nursery chair. Two years ago, the company secured licenses to operate a health vertical, where parents can order breast pumps covered by insurance, Medicaid included. That vertical is already a $50 million business. Forty percent of infants in the U.S. are born under Medicaid, and Babylist aims to serve 80% of that population by 2027. “There are so many parts of having a baby that are truly universal,” Gordon says of getting to know the Medicaid customer. “We do an exceptional job of serving both those audiences.”.For Gordon, this growth has also come from her aversion to a traditional part of running a startup: fundraising. “I was actually kind of terrible at fundraising,” she remembers. She raised less than $50 million over the past 14 years. “That felt like it was a curse, and now it’s a blessing,” says Gordon. “We always treated it as a business, not a startup.”.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com.– Call to action.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on MercadoLibre MELI, Amazon AMZN and Alibaba BABA..Here is a synopsis of all five stocks..It’s time to go digging for gold, literally. While the broader market has been jostling between interest rate anxiety and soft-landing optimism, the yellow metal has been stealthily consolidating gains. Meanwhile, there's one stock in the precious metals space that’s glimmering more than the rest.Today’s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Eldorado Gold, a mid-tier gold miner that’s setting itself up for a breakout year..Eldorado Gold is a Canadian-based gold and base metals producer with mining, development and exploration operations in Turkey, Canada, and Greece. While many of its peers overextend and overpromise, EGO has stayed lean, focused, and smart about where and how it digs..In a world where geopolitical risk is part of the game, Eldorado’s diversified asset base gives it a cushion. From the high-grade Lamaque mine in Quebec to the Skouries project in Greece, EGO is sitting on a resource base that’s about to deliver serious production upside..The reason for the favorable rank is that 4 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from $1.42 to $1.65 for the current year while next year’s number is up from $1.76 to $2.53..That means that next year’s earnings growth is forecast to come in at 53%. That’s on revenue growth forecasts of 19% this year and 36% next year..This growth is clearly illustrated in our Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart on Zacks.com. Estimates have gone from bottoming out in late 2023 to ticking higher until the start of this year, when estimates retreated a touch. They bottomed out at the start of Q3 and have been moving higher ever since. With geopolitical risk continuing despite talk of ceasefires and such, gold remains bid, helping the gold miners continue to shine..You ever walk into a grocery store and catch the smell of freshly baked bread? It’s a simple pleasure. But as investors, we have to separate that warm, comforting aroma from cold, hard earnings trends. That brings us to today’s Bear of the Day, Flowers Foods.

After delivering to Prime members at record-breaking speeds in 2023 and 2024, Amazon is continuing to innovate to deliver even faster in 2025. So far this year the number of items delivered the same or next day in the U.S. increased over 30% compared to the same period last year..This expansion goes beyond speed—it's about transforming daily life for rural customers, who typically live farther from brick-and-mortar retailers, have fewer product and brand choices, and face limited delivery options when shopping online. By investing in rural communities, Amazon’s speedy delivery will save customers time and money regardless of where they live—from North Padre Island, Texas and Asbury, Iowa to Lewes, Delaware and Fort Seneca, Ohio. With Prime, members have access to unlimited free Same-Day Delivery when spending over $25 at checkout..""Everybody loves fast delivery. So, whether you live in Monmouth, Iowa or in downtown Los Angeles, now you're going to have the same fantastic Amazon customer experience: the ability to get the wide variety of items you need to keep your household running every day, delivered the same or next day,"" said Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores..One of the biggest benefits of this expansion is the option for customers to shop Amazon’s everyday essentials, which encompasses a vast selection of affordable groceries and household goods. These items are speed-critical, and when customers need them, they often want them delivered as soon as possible. No one wants to wait two days to receive paper towels, diapers, or dog food when they’ve run out. This is why Amazon has started offering a large selection of everyday essentials for Same-Day Delivery, making it easier than ever for customers in small towns and rural communities to quickly stock up on groceries and household goods without needing to make an extra trip to the store. In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon’s fast delivery speeds helped drive its everyday essentials selection—comprising groceries and household essentials—to grow more than twice as fast as all other categories in the U.S. Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the U.S., with over $100B in gross sales—even when you exclude sales from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-brings-prime-delivery-speeds-120500336.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk

More importantly, I'll detail several different ways in which investors can invest in the Bitcoin movement..For much of its history, Bitcoin has been labeled as a highly speculative asset -- and rightfully so. Between its overly pronounced volatility, rising adoption rates, and ongoing regulatory uncertainties, Bitcoin is not exactly as mainstream as the U.S. dollar, for example..Nevertheless, cryptocurrency has gradually become more mainstream during the past several years thanks to a combination of factors..Retail investors showed early enthusiasm for blockchain technology and how prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum could be used to facilitate transactions in the real world..Over time, large financial institutions have also become more receptive to the idea of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols playing a role in the world of payments infrastructure, as well as the idea that assets such as Bitcoin could act as hedges to inflation -- similar to the way gold and certain other alternative assets do..In terms of utility beyond that of financial transactions, companies such as Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) and GameStop have actually acquired Bitcoin to augment their balance sheets. While such moves have been polarizing from the perspective of investors, holding Bitcoin alongside cash and short-term investments is not entirely unlike Palantir's strategy of holding gold on its balance sheet a few years ago.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-philippe-laffont-thinks-could-101500804.html,Market Risk Investment Risk Regulatory Risk Technological Risk

The company’s top line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. A strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial.Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence, growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are key positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus.The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to increase 8.5% from 2024. However, Amazon announced mixed guidance for the second quarter. High tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods imported from China have cast uncertainty on retailers such as Amazon.

The company’s performance is supported by strong execution across key growth initiatives. Home Depot continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings.These factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects.However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates.

Its Splunk acquisition enhances the recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio.However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition.

Despite this, shares trade at deep discounts, suggesting an upside if execution improves.Nevertheless, United Homes is executing a strategic transformation focused on margin expansion and operational efficiency. A shift toward refreshed home designs, now yielding 24% gross margins, supports profitability and reduces reliance on discounting. UHG’s pre-sale strategy improves margin visibility and working capital efficiency while rebidding efforts and faster build cycles enhances cost control.Though volume and margin remain under pressure amid soft demand, UHG is expanding into high-growth Southeastern markets, with a land-light model supporting disciplined capital returns.

Valuation remains attractive at 0.62X EV/S and 6.88X EV/EBITDA versus peers.Nevertheless, Eastern Company’s performance is driven by Velvac’s market share gains and operational enhancements in the Class 8 truck segment, including vertical integration and aftermarket expansion.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Supply Chain Dive newsletter. .Amazon is temporarily waiving a fee that sellers shipping to Walmart customers incurred for using its Multi-Channel Fulfillment service, the company announced June 10..Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment offers shipping services for orders placed on other e-commerce channels. The 5% surcharge levied on Multi-Channel Fulfillment shipments delivered by non-Amazon carriers will be waived through Jan. 14, 2026, for orders originating from Walmart Marketplace..Walmart Marketplace's policy bars sellers from shipping orders in competitors' boxes or packaging. The retailer's website said Multi-Channel Fulfillment users must instead ship their items in a neutral box and block Amazon Logistics as a carrier to ensure Amazon-branded vehicles don't deliver the orders..Due to Walmart's rules, Multi-Channel Fulfillment users had to incur the 5% charge to ship their Walmart orders to customers. This fee had been a barrier for sellers using the Amazon service, Vanessa Hung, CEO of Online Seller Solutions, said in a LinkedIn post..""If you’ve held off on MCF for Walmart, this is the window,"" Hung said of the surcharge being waived..Amazon's move comes in the midst of the two retail rivals fighting to win more users for their respective cross-channel fulfillment services. Walmart Multichannel Solutions, which is comparable to Multi-Channel Fulfillment, recently highlighted its free unbranded packaging services while calling out a ""5% or more"" charge levied by other platforms..Multi-Channel Fulfillment users can fulfill Walmart orders by using an Amazon-supported order management app, or by manually submitting orders on Amazon Seller Central that follow Walmart's shipping policies, per the June 10 announcement..Walmart used to be even stricter on sellers who used Amazon for items sold on its marketplace, according to Ravi Patel, director of i.e.rare, an e-commerce marketing and advertising agency..""Even if they used plain boxes, Walmart’s system could detect orders coming from Amazon (like through USPS tracking), and some accounts were suspended,"" Patel said on LinkedIn.

Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares.  Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such as Nvidia and Amazon -- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed.","Only one ""Magnificent Seven"" company hasn’t yet split its stock..Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such as Nvidia and Amazon -- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed. But one AI stock, in particular, hasn't ever launched a split, and that's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Here's why this company, which has soared more than 300% over the past three years, could be next on the list..Before diving in, though, let's take a closer look at how and why companies split their stocks. These operations are used to lower the price of each individual share -- so companies generally do this after their stock prices have made significant gains and have arrived at a price that may discourage some investors from buying..For example, as stocks approach the $1,000 mark, even if valuation looks fine, they still may be viewed as expensive by certain investors. And investors who don't have access to fractional shares might find it difficult to buy a stock at these levels. These two elements could weigh on demand for the company's stock, limiting its potential for further gains..Companies split their stock by simply offering more shares to current holders -- the number of shares depends on the ratio of the split. So, for example, in a 10-for-1 split, if you originally held one share, you would hold 10 post-split. The value of each share would be worth less than it was prior to the operation, but the total value of your holding would remain the same..All of this means a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about the company or the stock, but it does make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy..As mentioned, Nvidia and Amazon completed splits, along with other technology giants such as Broadcom and Alphabet. And, over time, almost every member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- a group of tech stocks that led the stock market higher last year -- has completed a stock split. The exception is social media and AI powerhouse Meta..Like its fellow Magnificent Seven players, Meta has delivered impressive stock performance -- and actually is the second-best performer over the past three years, after AI chip giant Nvidia..Today, Meta shares trade for more than $600, outpacing the rest of these star tech stocks -- Microsoft is the closest, with shares trading for about $470.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-watch-ai-stock-081000729.html,No risk.

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday.

The company’s top line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. A strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence, growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are key positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus. The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to increase 8.5% from 2024. However, Amazon announced mixed guidance for the second quarter. High tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods imported from China have cast uncertainty on retailers such as Amazon. AMZN's free cash flow has decreased significantly.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Home Depot’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (+2.2% vs. -2.5%). The company’s performance is supported by strong execution across key growth initiatives. Home Depot continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings. These factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects. However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates. Margin pressure, currency headwinds, and macroeconomic uncertainty also remain key risks. HD is also navigating a complex global trade environment, with rising tariffs.(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)Shares of Cisco Systems have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+44.7% vs. +43.5%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in recurring revenue bases bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances the recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio. However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.(You can read the full research report on Cisco Systems here >>>)United Homes’ shares have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (-37.4% vs. -5.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $193.97 million is facing challenges which include persistent margin pressure, declining orders and execution risk tied to unproven strategies. Despite this, shares trade at deep discounts, suggesting an upside if execution improves.Nevertheless, United Homes is executing a strategic transformation focused on margin expansion and operational efficiency. A shift toward refreshed home designs, now yielding 24% gross margins, supports profitability and reduces reliance on discounting. UHG’s pre-sale strategy improves margin visibility and working capital efficiency while rebidding efforts and faster build cycles enhances cost control. Though volume and margin remain under pressure amid soft demand, UHG is expanding into high-growth Southeastern markets, with a land-light model supporting disciplined capital returns. The recent debt refinancing improves liquidity and reduces dilution risk.(You can read the full research report on United Homes here >>>)Shares of Eastern have underperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the past year (-1.3% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $142.05 million has risks like elevated SG&A amid restructuring, cyclical reliance on Class 8 OEMs, weak R&D investment, and recent negative cash flow due to working capital drag. Valuation remains attractive at 0.62X EV/S and 6.88X EV/EBITDA versus peers. Nevertheless, Eastern Company’s performance is driven by Velvac’s market share gains and operational enhancements in the Class 8 truck segment, including vertical integration and aftermarket expansion. Despite industry softness, Eastern sustains profitability, posting Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and net income of $2 million, with a gross margin of 22.4%. A leaner balance sheet and improved working capital reinforce financial flexibility. Strategic manufacturing footprints across the United States, Mexico, and China support tariff agility and local sourcing trends.

He’s not making the same mistake twice,"The Amazon founder, who is worth nearly $224 billion, is set to wed fiancée Lauren Sanchez this week.","Jeff Bezos’ upcoming marriage to Lauren Sanchez has been complicated by his immense wealth. After losing billions in his split from his first wife, the Amazon mogul’s second chance at love comes with new layers of legal protections..When Jeff Bezos says “I do” for the second time, the real vows may be in his prenuptial agreement. With billions on the line and a famously public divorce behind him, the Amazon founder’s pending nuptials with former news anchor Lauren Sanchez are raising speculation about the legal fine print behind the mogul’s highly anticipated wedding. Bezos, who is the fourth richest person in the world and currently worth $223.7 billion, stands to lose a significant amount of his fortune without the proper legal protections should his second marriage fail..Bezos and Sanchez’s three-day Venetian wedding celebration kicks off on June 24 and is said to be costing the couple upwards of $10 million. The couple announced their engagement in 2023, but ultimately delayed tying the knot due to delays with the prenup. According to The Hollywood Reporter, an insider said that the Bezos-Sanchez marriage was originally planned for the winter of 2024 in Aspen, but adjustments to the legal agreement pushed the date back, with Bezos’ lawyers allegedly forbidding the billionaire from moving forward until the prenup was settled. Bezos vehemently denied that there were initial plans for an Aspen wedding via X..Bezos’ and Sanchez’ prenup comes after the Amazon founder’s divorce in 2019 from MacKenzie Scott in which no such agreement existed. Scott walked away with more than $38 billion in Amazon shares, making the split one of the costliest separations in history. The divorce included explosive cheating allegations that accused Bezos of having an affair with now-fiancée Sanchez. The pair’s 25-year marriage long predated Bezos’ financial success; indeed, Scott worked as the first Amazon employee and witnessed Bezos usher Amazon into its iconic position. She also has four children with Bezos..Bezos’ decision to protect his assets the second time around isn’t shocking to high-profile divorce attorney Robert Cohen, of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer & Simpson, who has handled the divorces of Melinda French Gates and Michael Bloomberg. “They’ve likely been through a nightmare before, which is litigation over their prior divorce and how much you’re giving the other side, or getting, and they don’t want to do that,” he tells Fortune..Sanchez, who was married to her first husband Patrick Whitesell until 2019, allegedly signed a prenup with her former spouse with whom she shares two children.

The service, first announced in February, now reaches over a million users, Amazon confirmed to TechCrunch on Monday. However, Alexa+ is not yet publicly available..Instead, Amazon has been working through its waitlist, sending out invites to those customers who originally signed up to test the service when it became available. Over the past several weeks, many people have shared on social media that they’ve received an invite to try Alexa+, whose service offers more natural and personalized interactions, smart home integration, and expanded capabilities thanks to AI..Alexa+ is available for free during Early Access and will later be free for Prime customers. Non-Prime users will be able to use the service for $19.99 per month after it publicly launches..Amazon earlier this year noted that invites to try out the new system would roll out in waves in the months ahead. As of May 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that Alexa+ had so far reached over 100,000 users, representing only a tiny fraction of the 600 million Alexa devices that had been sold. That number has grown significantly in the weeks since..Alexa+ represents a serious attempt by Amazon to create a generative AI experience for consumers that it can eventually monetize..Though Amazon created a market for smart home-connected, voice-based assistants through its Alexa-powered Echo devices, it wasn’t able to turn that traction into a revenue-generating business. Meanwhile, Alexa lost its shine in more recent years as generative AI services, like ChatGPT, took off. Compared with modern-day AI, Alexa began to feel clunky, constrained, and underpowered..Alexa+ aims to bring the digital assistant new capabilities. The service allows users to chat with the digital assistant using more natural language, where you can phrase requests your own way. For instance, you could tell Alexa, “It’s too cold in here,” to have Alexa adjust your smart thermostat. You’ll also more easily be able to create routines, search across your Ring camera footage, interrupt or pivot the conversation with the assistant, and more..The experience is more personalized, too, as it saves your preferences and remembers what you like, from favorite songs to recipes and beyond..With its generative AI component, Alexa can do things like summarize long emails you share with the service, create unique bedtime stories, generate quizzes from study guides, make travel itineraries, provide summaries of your smart home activity, and answer other questions, similar to how an AI chatbot might respond.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-million-people-now-access-173840255.html,No risk.

CEO Elon Musk confirmed the robotaxi launch, while social media influencers shared videos of their inaugural rides. The pilot is considered a key step toward Musk's broader vision of autonomous mobility as a major revenue driver for the company.A small fleet of around 10 Tesla vehicles was seen operating in the South Congress area without a driver, but a passenger in the front seat acting as a safety monitor. However, the extent of their control over the vehicles remains unclear. Tesla had invited a select group of influencers to participate in the trial, which was tightly controlled and restricted to a specific area. Per Musk’s post on X, rides were priced at a flat rate of $4.20.As the launch approached, Texas lawmakers passed new legislation regulating autonomous vehicles. Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring companies to obtain state permits to operate driverless cars.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Facilities Dive newsletter. .The rapid data center buildout is an opportunity for nearby facilities managers to make their own operations more efficient using the computing hubs’ waste heat, according to data center and district energy experts..The practice is already common in Europe, where urban district energy systems plug into data centers to pull heat off servers and provide efficient climate control for homes, businesses and campuses, Rob Thornton, president and CEO of the International District Energy Association, said in an interview..Data center heat recovery is less common in the U.S., but a nearly 10-year-old system that supplies heat to Amazon’s downtown Seattle campus highlights the potential in campus or dense urban environments, Thornton said..The Seattle system pulls waste heat from a 34-story “carrier hotel” that serves hundreds of telecom and internet companies. The system then runs the waste heat through five heat-reclaiming chillers that heat water to about 130 degrees, according to Amazon. .The resulting hot water is potent enough that the 5 million square-foot campus rarely needs to use its backup boilers, Amazon said in 2017. The tech giant estimated the project will save 80 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and avoid 65 million pounds of carbon emissions over its 25-year service life..A district energy system serving a suburban commercial district near Toronto also tapped an Equinix data center to provide space heat to “multiple residential buildings and a nearby hotel, hospital and local shopping center” and year-round hot water to “multiple buildings” in the area, Equinix Senior Manager of SustainabilityNoah Nkonge wrote in a blog post last year..Equinix also supplies heat to a swimming pool built for the 2024 Paris Olympics and surrounding nearby buildings, according to Nkonge, who serves as heat export lead at Equinix..“District energy systems have scale to assimilate and utilize large volumes of heat that would otherwise simply be rejected into the local environment as waste, sometimes exacerbating the heat island effect in cities,” Thornton said..The heat expelled by data center cooling systems is much lower-grade than the heat coming off gas-fired boilers, so it generally needs to be concentrated in chiller systems like Amazon’s and may not be useful for industrial processes that require higher temperatures. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-center-heat-could-us-105059799.html,No risk.

Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services..Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years..The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC..E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10.

These players faced a few difficult months recently due to concerns about a potential economic slowdown. However, some of the uncertainty has passed, suggesting better days may be ahead for AI stocks..Against this backdrop, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are set to soar in the second half. Here's why..President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports weighed on technology stocks, including AI chip giant Nvidia, several weeks ago. This pushed Nvidia down nearly 30% from the start of the year through early April. Though the president initially exempted electronics products, this exemption was temporary, suggesting chips and other items would face tariffs at some point in the near future..But Nvidia has since rebounded, thanks to optimism that tariffs won't be as steep as originally expected and as the company showed the strength of its earnings through the first quarter of the year. Nvidia's revenue surged 69% to $44 billion, demand remained strong, and customer comments indicate that their spending plans for the year remain intact. This bodes well for ongoing growth for Nvidia..On top of this, the chip giant is making investments in U.S. manufacturing to limit any eventual tariff impact and sticks to its plan to update chips on an annual basis -- a move that should keep it ahead of rivals..Today, Nvidia trades for only 33 times forward earnings estimates, down from about 50 times just a few months ago, and this level offers the stock plenty of room to run in the second half..Among all the top tech stocks, Apple may be the one that has suffered the most amid the recent tariff turbulence. Trump, displeased that Apple has generally produced most iPhones abroad, even threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's imported iPhones. Meanwhile, Apple has made efforts to diversify its manufacturing, with a plan to move much of it from China to India..Uncertainty remains as the president wants Apple to bring iPhone production to the U.S., but doing this could result in a drastically higher price for the smartphone.

But Amazon isn't just playing host; it's also developing its quantum hardware, creating two distinct paths to profit from what could become a trillion-dollar market. This dual approach makes Amazon the most overlooked opportunity in the market for quantum computing..Conventional wisdom says practical quantum computing remains decades away. Most experts point to persistent challenges with error rates, qubit stability, and the need for near-absolute-zero operating temperatures. They're probably wrong..What skeptics often overlook is the recursive learning potential of artificial intelligence (AI). When AI systems can design better AI systems, progress compounds exponentially. DeepMind's AlphaFold solved protein folding -- a 50-year challenge -- in months. The same recursive improvement cycle is about to hit quantum computing..IBM plans to deliver its fault-tolerant quantum computer, Starling, by 2029 -- years ahead of previous predictions. The company says its breakthrough error-correction techniques will enable a system 20,000 times more powerful than today's quantum computers. This accelerated timeline reflects how AI is helping solve quantum's biggest challenges faster than expected..While pure-play quantum companies race to build better hardware, Amazon has taken a different approach.

What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html,No risk.

Meanwhile, a $1,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago would now be worth more than $265,000..While investing in stocks typically comes with a much higher level of risk compared to bonds and other fixed-income investments, the potential for explosive returns is also much higher. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors identified these two companies as top investment candidates to put $1,000 into right now..Keith Noonan (Micron Technology): Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking the world by storm, and it seems virtually certain that its transformative impacts are still in the very stages of unfolding. Along with software advances from a wide variety of players, it's likely that high-powered hardware from a smaller group of providers will continue to play a central role in pushing the technology forward..Nvidia will likely continue to lead the high end of the graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies that help power advanced training and inference applications for AI, but it also looks like Advanced Micro Devices could be making some significant inroads in the space. While both of these processing specialists could be worth betting on, I think that investors should also take a close look at one of the key components providers for their most advanced hardware -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)..Micron is a designer and manufacturer of memory chips and storage solutions that's playing an important role in the AI revolution. While the company's business has historically revolved mostly around the consumer market, that's changed rapidly -- and memory chips used in GPUs, accelerators, and other hardware for data centers are now central to its growth story. The company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions are used by both Nvidia and AMD for advanced AI processors, and the demand outlook for these technologies is very promising..In addition to being a pick-and-shovel play that should allow investors to benefit from rising demand for GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, and other players in the AI processors space, Micron could be poised to benefit from geopolitical trends. Due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, leading domestic tech companies will likely be less inclined to rely on memory chips and storage solutions from Chinese providers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-invest-1-000-124500590.html,Market risk

As I'm writing this on June 20, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index is up only 1.5% year to date. But this mellow return included a deep dip in April, so the index has gained 24% from the bottom of its 52-week low..So, things are extra volatile this year, and I understand if you'd rather keep some cash on hand right now. But even now, a few stocks can inspire me to put my extra cash to work. Read on to see why my hand hovers over the ""buy"" button for Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Costco (NASDAQ: COST), and Target (NYSE: TGT) in June 2025..Media-streaming technology veteran Roku has had quite a ride lately. Its stock price shot up by 50% over the past year but has taken a slight detour more recently, dropping 3% in the last six months..The growth story is still alive and well, with excitement over new deals, such as the recent Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ad partnership, keeping optimism afloat. However, the company still isn't showing a profit, so valuation ratios based on profitability don't make any sense. Instead, you can look at Roku's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which sits at a reasonable 2.8. That metric floated in double-digit territory four years ago..For now, Roku is acting a bit like the kid in class who has tons of potential but hasn't quite turned in the homework -- yet. The platform is growing, and recent partnerships could be a game changer, but the market wants to see proof that all these moves will translate to real, scalable profits. That's why Roku's stock looks cheap in this period of growth-focused operations and limited profits..If you're in it for the long haul and don't mind a few twists and turns, Roku still looks like a compelling candidate for a growth-focused portfolio. It's one of the few stocks I don't mind buying right now since its short-term price moves tend to be unpredictable anyway. This is a long-term growth idea..Wholesale warehouse retailer Costco is a different story. The stock has been soaring for years, lifting the P/S ratio to a lofty 1.6. That would be low in the high-growth media-streaming market, but Costco's valuation looks luxurious next to other large-scale retailers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-favorite-stocks-buy-now-115300904.html,Roku: Moderate Risk Costco: Low Risk Target: High Risk

The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html,Market Risk Technological Disruption Risk Investment Risk

However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083000803.html,No risk.

The development raises serious questions about the future of traditional payment networks, especially as retailers become increasingly frustrated with the fees associated with them..Let's examine Visa's stance on stablecoins, its recent earnings, and valuation to determine whether its stock is a buy, sell, or hold..Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a steady value by being pegged to traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Backed by reserves of cash or cash-equivalent assets such as Treasury securities, they are primarily used to hold value or facilitate transactions within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem..For retailers like Amazon and Walmart, the idea is that stablecoins could reduce settlement delays, eliminate interchange fees, and ultimately become less dependent on payment processors such as Visa and its closest competitor, Mastercard..Visa's management isn't blind to the shifting landscape. The company offers a seven-day-a-week stablecoin settlement, having recently surpassed $200 million in cumulative stablecoin volume. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney described the nascent, but fast-growing opportunity:.It's still early, but we do see real potential, which is why we've been investing in the crypto space broadly in the stablecoin space specifically for many years now. We've built up a team of real experts that I think are very well respected among the ecosystem, but it's early. On the one hand, $200 million is a great kind of milestone. On the other hand, it's still a relatively, a very small portion of our overall settlement volume..Additionally, Visa is actively exploring programmable finance through initiatives like its Tokenized Asset Platform, which aims to help banks securely issue and manage stablecoins. One of its early partners, BBVA Argentina, plans to roll out the pilot stablecoin project with Visa sometime in 2025..While it remains unclear whether stablecoins will achieve widespread adoption, Visa is taking steps to ensure it maintains a central role if they do. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Congress are working on a regulatory framework that would set clear rules for stablecoins, including pathways for private companies to issue them under federal oversight.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-stock-buy-now-124500248.html,Competitive Risk

Time in the market is more important than how much money you have to start. But dollar-cost averaging into a well-chosen portfolio of growth stocks can increase in value significantly over a few decades..To give you some ideas to get started, three Motley Fool contributors recently selected three competitively positioned companies to invest in today. Here's why they like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON)..Jennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon has changed many lives in many ways, from providing essential e-commerce services that have reimagined shopping habits to creating incredible shareholder wealth for early investors. That kind of growth isn't likely to happen again, but there's so much more opportunity for Amazon, and smart investors can still buy shares today to see their investments thrive..Amazon is the top name in two different industries, an incredible feat for a company that started out as an online bookseller. It has the lead in U.S. e-commerce by a wide margin, with no chance of any competitor taking over in the foreseeable future. Plus, it's continually upgrading its platform to keep it that way. Deliveries are getting faster; it's adding new products and brands to the marketplace, including luxury brands Michael Kors and Laura Mercier in the first quarter, and it's using technology like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its systems..Speaking of AI, Amazon is pioneering many of the most potent generative AI programs, primarily through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment. The second growth business where it has a lead is cloud computing, and this segment continues to grow at robust rates. AWS sales increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, and this high-margin business is also padding the bottom line, accounting for 63% of the total company operating income..CEO Andy Jassy is always talking about how massive the AI opportunity is, and it's already generating billions of dollars in sales for Amazon. He says that 85% of information technology spending is still on the premises, but he sees it as a given that it will flip in the next decade or two. ""Before this generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi-hundred-billion-dollar revenue run rate business,"" Jassy said on the first-quarter earnings call.

Remember, the movie by the same name doesn't have the happiest of endings, and the tragedy made sense as a metaphor for potential market bubbles. Still, the Magnificent Seven group keeps setting the tone for the overall stock market, and most of these stocks are market darlings in 2025, with double-digit price gains over the last 52 weeks..But Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is lagging behind with a 2% price dip over the last year, and the stock looks downright undervalued in many ways. It's the only Magnificent Seven stock I have bought this year, for one simple reason: It's the best combination of affordable shares and unbeatable artificial intelligence (AI) expertise in this elite group..The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running circles around Google Cloud..But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices. Nvidia stock trades at 47 times earnings and 49 times free cash flows today. Microsoft and Amazon have P/E ratios in the mid-30s and cash flow multiples well above Nvidia's. At the same time, Alphabet stock looks affordable at 19 times earnings and 28 times free cash flows..The numbers never tell the whole story, and there's more to say about Alphabet's long-term growth opportunities. From AI services to quantum computing systems, the company was built to thrive amid ever-changing markets and unexpected economy jolts.

Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chips fall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-prediction-someone-invested-110000215.html,Market Risk Competition Risk

But not all growth stocks are young tech start-ups. Some are established players that have dug wide moats around their businesses. And one of the best long-term growth stocks is a household name: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)..The company continues to expand its revenue and earnings, maintains its enviable lead in e-commerce, and is even benefiting from the rise of AI. Here's why it's worth spending $1,000 to buy Amazon stock right now..Amazon has been such a dominant leader in the e-commerce market for so many years that it can be easy to forget just how far ahead of the competition it really is. Amazon currently holds 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, while its next-closest competitor, Walmart, has just over 6%. Amazon's ability to attract online customers, give them good customer service, and make their shopping experience relatively seamless is why the company has an estimated 180 million Prime members in the U.S. (and 220 million globally)..That huge pool of customers has led to continued e-commerce sales growth for Amazon, with North American revenue rising 8% in the most recent quarter to nearly $93 billion. And there's likely more growth coming. The company's management is guiding for sales to rise nearly 9% year over year in the second quarter to $161.5 billion, at the midpoint of guidance..Most people probably don't think of Amazon as an AI company, but it's certainly benefiting from the surging need for artificial intelligence services. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud computing provider with 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft with 21%..This means that companies of all shapes and sizes use AWS for its data center services, including AI-focused capabilities that help companies use and develop their own AI services. Amazon's lead in cloud computing is helping it tap into the AI cloud services market that Goldman Sachs estimates will be worth $2 trillion by 2030..To put Amazon's potential for AI into perspective, consider that in the first quarter of this year, Amazon's AWS operating income was $11.5 billion -- double the amount it earned from its North American e-commerce segment. To stay ahead of the competition, Amazon said it will increase its capital expenditures (capex) spending to $100 billion this year, with much of it going to AI infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ultimate-growth-stock-buy-1-093500343.html,No risk.

The competitive advantage and growth strategy of a company can be misunderstood, leading to depressed valuations and underperforming share prices..Investors who can see through the stock volatility and focus on the key signals that set a company up for long-term success can be rewarded with outsize gains over time..Here are two stocks of market-leading brands that are trading well off their previous highs and could be significantly undervalued..RH (NYSE: RH), the company formerly known as Restoration Hardware, emerged as a prominent luxury furniture brand over the past decade. In the past year, however, the business struggled with several macroeconomic headwinds, such as a weak housing market and uncertainties over tariffs..Questions about near-term demand have sent the stock down 52% this year, but this is a great buying opportunity for a long-term investor..RH's trailing-12-month revenue of $3.3 billion is below its previous peak of $3.9 billion a few years ago, but it just reported a strong first quarter. Revenue grew 12% year over year in the quarter, outperforming the rest of the industry..RH is expanding its addressable market to hospitality offerings in its design galleries, such as restaurants and wine bars, which has elevated the shopping experience to something that cannot be replicated by e-commerce competitors..Moreover, the company entered the $200 billion North American hotel industry with RH Guesthouses, and it offers much more, including private jets and luxury yachts for charter in the Caribbean and Mediterranean. All this creates an ecosystem of services meant to showcase the RH lifestyle and raise the brand to something more than just furniture products..It's for these reasons that RH has a history of reporting much higher margins than the average furniture store. Its adjusted operating margin was 7% in the first quarter, below its previous 10-year average of 12%. It should return to those higher margins in a strong housing market, and this is not reflected in the stock's valuation..Over the last 10 years, the stock traded at a price-to-sales multiple ranging from 0.48 to 6.59. The average was just over 2 times sales, with the stock currently trading at a multiple of 1.16. Investors who buy shares at these lower discounted prices and hold until the housing market is fully recovered should be well rewarded.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-stocks-buy-now-081000878.html,No risk.

2025-06-21 05:58:00,"Filecoin is building the 'Airbnb for file storage', says exec",Web3 infrastructure aims to bring trustless storage to the masses—without the Big Tech price tag.,"Filecoin is building the 'Airbnb for file storage', says exec originally appeared on TheStreet..In a digital world where nearly all web data flows through Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, Marta Belcher and Filecoin are flipping the script..“Think of it like Airbnb for file storage,” said Belcher, President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation, in a recent conversation with TheStreet Roundtable. “People all over the world can rent out unused storage space on their hardware to store encrypted shards of data—securely, privately, and without relying on centralized entities.”.At its core, Filecoin is building what Belcher calls “foundational technology for the next generation of the web,” offering a decentralized alternative to cloud giants like AWS. The goal? Resilience, security, and control—values often missing from the current data ecosystem..When most investors hear the word “crypto,” they think price charts, digital assets, and decentralized finance. But according to Marta Belcher, President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation, that’s only scratching the surface..“Crypto isn’t just about finance,” Belcher said. “The real innovation is in programmable money.”.Filecoin is showing what that means—starting with decentralized file storage. At first glance, the network looks like a Web3 challenger to Amazon Web Services, allowing anyone in the world to rent out unused storage space and get paid in FIL tokens. But it’s the how that’s revolutionary: payments on Filecoin are automated, granular, and permissionless..“You can write a smart contract to pay a storage provider in real time, based on their uptime and performance,” said Belcher. “Or pay a songwriter a fraction of a cent for every second a song is streamed. These kinds of micro-transactions were never possible before crypto.”.It’s a bold reframe of what blockchain technology can do. Instead of speculative hype or abstract decentralization, Filecoin is highlighting a tangible use case: letting people earn, store, and interact with data and payments in programmable ways—no middlemen required..“Web3 lets us build systems where rules are baked into code,” Belcher added. “That opens up entirely new business models—ones where creators, consumers, and infrastructure providers are all directly connected.”.As regulators and investors continue to debate the future of digital assets, Filecoin is already shipping it. For Belcher and her team, the message is simple: crypto isn’t a bet on finance. It’s a bet on the programmable economy..Filecoin is building the 'Airbnb for file storage', says exec first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 20, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 20, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/filecoin-building-airbnb-file-storage-215818126.html,No risk.

The next few quarters could be even better.,"An exclusive TV advertising partnership between Roku and Amazon is a big win for everyone..At least three analysts pushed their price targets on Roku higher following the news, including one outright upgrade..Roku stock is rolling over the past year, but it should turn even more heads as it returns to profitability later this year..10 stocks we like better than Roku ›.It's been quite the week for Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and its shareholders. The country's leader in getting folks streaming from their TVs kicked off the fireworks by announcing a transformative deal with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) on Monday. An analyst upgrade and a pair of other firms jacking up their price targets followed..The stock is up nearly 10% heading into the final trading day of the week. Roku is a name that has fallen off of many growth investing radars, but the shares are now up 55% over the past year. With its solid growth, continuing niche dominance, and projected return to profitability for the second half of this year, it's a name you should probably start paying attention to again..At its frenzied peak in 2021, a $5,000 investment could barely be exchanged for 10 shares. That same $5,000 today could have you walking away with 60 shares. This is the kind of math that can burn investors if they're buying a falling stock with dim prospects, but today's Roku is in much better shape than it was four years ago..Roku's revenue and time spent on its platform have both nearly doubled since the shares peaked six times higher four summers ago. However, just saying that Roku is a larger company than it was back in 2021 isn't enough to convince you that this is the smartest growth stock for your next investment. Roku's success in continuing to gain market share as North America's leading streaming operating system for TVs will continue to open doors; doors like the one that was slammed off its hinges on Monday with its new partnership with Amazon..The leading online retailer runs a popular programmatic demand-side ad buying platform, and this week it turned heads by striking an integration deal with Roku. The two companies are typically competitors in the streaming space; Roku's platform competes with Amazon's Fire TV. But despite the wide gap in market cap -- Roku at $12 million and Amazon at $2.3 billion -- the online retailer doesn't attract the same captive U.S. audience as the pioneer..In the spirit of the ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" adage, Amazon advertisers will now have access to Roku's massive reach of roughly 80 million U.S. households spending an average of more than four hours a day cradling the Roku remote. The early tests were fruitful. Amazon found that teaming up with Roku would deliver its connected TV clients 40% more unique viewers with the same budget. With better ad targeting and the ability to lower the instances of viewers seeing the same ads repeatedly, Amazon points out that its advertisers can generate a lot more value on Roku through this partnership.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartest-growth-stock-buy-5-185037246.html,No risk.

AI scraping has been a key discussion amid the AI revolution, as the practice raises questions about ethical usage of the technology..Reddit (RDDT) is suing Anthropic (ANTH.PVT), alleging the AI company used its content without authorization..TollBit CEO and co-founder Toshit Panigrahi joins Catalysts to discuss how TollBit helps publishers protect their content from AI scraping..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here..This month Reddit sued AI giant Anthropic claiming that the OpenAI rival had accessed its platform of more than 100,000 times. It accessed the platform since July of 2022 after Anthropic allegedly said it had blocked its bots from doing so. We sat down with the COO of Reddit to discuss the suit. .What's important to us is that um that we are able to protect our users privacy, their deletion rights, like we have policies um that ensure that, you know, when users take down a post, like the post is taken down. And so it's really important and as we said in our terms of service that, you know, we have a conversation with folks who have access to our data because that's a commitment that we have in terms of our policies. .Our next guest has crunched the numbers on the size and scope of AI scraping by bots and helps publishers profit from this scraping. Joining us now, we've got Toit Fenagrahi, who is the Tolbit CEO and co-founder. Tolbit is a New York based startup that helps news publishers monitor and make money when AI companies scrape their content, uh by acting almost like a toll booth of the internet. Did we get that right, Toit? .Yes, that's correct. Thanks for having me. .Absolutely. So take us into your business and and what you're seeing more broadly here, especially as we're knowing and knowledge of knowledgeable of how much scraping these AI engines need to do in order to get either knowledge sets that can then be used for generative AI efforts and they reach to basically every source part of the web that they can essentially get their hands on for free. .Absolutely. So Tolbit is a platform that helps uh websites of all sizes monitor, manage, and monetize their AI bot traffic, which essentially means we give them tools to to get an idea of how uh rampant the scraping might be on their site. We give them tools to block it and enforce content access rights. And then we give them uh a real innovation is our bot paywall, a tool that allows these AI bots to come in and actually pay for sanctioned access to that content um and and data, right? And I think one of the things that we're seeing, right, especially in the last quarter, is the demand for not for uh uh content for training, content for retrieval at inference time. When people ask a question, the bots have to go out and read and answer your question. .Is AI training as it stands right now ethical from the standard practices that users expect when they're on the internet? .I think this is a question that's bigger than all of us. I think we're uh uh definitely looking to some of the courts to set to decide and set some precedents as to whether or not training is fair use. But I think uh us as a business, right, and I think where some of the conversation should be going should be around, you know, these bots who are who have to go out when you and I ask a question on any of these platforms to go read that content, right? They don't know what happened today. They don't know what the price of a ticket was if you wanted to go to France, right? They actually have to go out and access those sites to get that information. That will be a far bigger use case than than uh just training as these tools continue to evolve. .And so what what is the revenue model like? How how does the business make money? .So essentially what with the technology that we built, we have built a gateway that any AI application, agent, bot can come in through and actually pay uh through the form of micro payments for access to content and data, right? So it could be anything from what happened today, right? You want to you want to read um what happened on the news today to I want to know, you know, what the price of a hotel is today in New York and I want you to go uh book it for me, right? And so we are able to uh let the websites set those rules, set the the access protocols for what that content data should cost. And then we take a transaction fee on top of that for enabling this faster, cleaner, licensed access to that content data. .To a really fascinating business and I'm sure there's a very large total addressable market that just continues to grow at this juncture. Thanks so much for breaking this down. We appreciate it. .Thank you.

Should You Buy AMZN Stock Here?,"With Amazon reportedly exploring the launch of its own stablecoin, should you buy AMZN stock here?","The cryptocurrency landscape is heating up in 2025, driven in large part by President Donald Trump’s public embrace of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and crypto-friendly policies, as well as the recent blockbuster IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL). Amid this shifting backdrop, stablecoins — cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to stable assets, typically the U.S. dollar — have caught the attention of global giants seeking to streamline their payment processes and significantly reduce transaction fees..Amazon (AMZN), one of the world’s largest e-commerce and cloud computing companies, is reportedly exploring its own entry into this space by launching a stablecoin for online transactions. This move could have enormous implications, potentially allowing Amazon to sidestep billions in fees currently paid to credit card networks and banks, while simultaneously creating an entirely new profit stream through earned interest on customer funds held in stablecoins..Dear Tesla Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for June 30.3 ETFs with Dividend Yields of 12% or Higher for Your Income Portfolio.This Options Tool Can Show You How to Trade Tesla Stock Ahead of Robotaxi Day.Markets move fast.

In this article, we’ll examine the potential impact of Amazon issuing its own stablecoin, evaluate the risks and opportunities involved, and determine whether now is the right time for investors to buy AMZN stock. Let’s dive in!.Amazon (AMZN) is a global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company operates a diverse business model, encompassing retail sales of consumer products through its online and physical stores, cloud services through AWS, and advertising and subscription offerings. AMZN currently has a market cap of $2.26 trillion..Shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant are down just 4.2% on a year-to-date basis. AMZN stock has had a turbulent ride this year. After climbing above $240 in February, the stock dropped more than 30% to just under $170 by early April, largely due to Trump’s aggressive tariff agenda. However, as Trump paused or lowered the majority of his levies, the stock began trending upward, forming higher highs and higher lows, and most recently holding near the $210 support level. AMZN stock remains highly sensitive to tariff headlines, which is unsurprising given its massive e-commerce business, where tariffs can squeeze both revenue and profit margins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-wants-launch-own-stablecoin-160902302.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Reputational Risk Regulatory Risk Technological Risk

(AMZN) is ending an experiment that saw drivers in Kia (000270.KS) Souls make same-day deliveries and will rely on its network of gig-economy workers instead..In the test, Amazon contract delivery firms in several US states deployed drivers for four- or five-hours shifts in the boxy little Kia Corp. hatchbacks. The trial, which began to roll out in 2023, gave the world’s largest online retailer more control over deliveries. If widely deployed, it also could have reduced the company’s reliance on Amazon Flex drivers, who use their own cars to ferry orders to customers’ homes. Those gig workers will now pick up the affected routes..Owners of the participating Delivery Service Partners, as Amazon calls its contract delivery firms, were recently notified that the quick-delivery program will be winding down over the next few months, the company confirmed..“After more than a year of gathering feedback from customers, DSPs, and teams at Same-Day Delivery facilities, we’ve determined that the DSP model isn’t currently the right fit for Same-Day Delivery and we’ll be moving away from it,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate the contributions from participating DSPs and their teams, and we’ll provide support throughout this transition.”.Amazon tested the concept in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas and Washington. Kelly said the affected DSPs can operate other Amazon routes and that the company will help drivers get jobs with other firms, if necessary. The program’s vehicles were rentals and will be returned to the vendor, he said..Amazon, which started out relying exclusively on the US Postal Service and other carriers to get goods to customers, in the last decade built a sprawling logistics operation centered around small businesses. These DSPs lease blue Amazon Prime-branded vans and employ the drivers, who might deliver 200 or more packages a day..Flex drivers opt in via a smartphone app and typically deliver packages from Amazon’s same-day delivery depots..Both programs have been criticized by workers’ advocates who contend that the drivers, operating at Amazon’s direction, should be classified as company employees..©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ends-speedy-delivery-kia-154028075.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk

Let's explore why a $1,000 bet on shares in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Realty Income (NYSE: O) could help investors preserve and grow their portfolios in this rapidly evolving economic landscape.","Amazon's workforce reduction could be going into hyperdrive. Equity ownership will be key in an AI-driven world..While Realty Income isn't pioneering new technologies, its business model is stable and recession-proof..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.We are in a pivotal moment where new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics could dramatically change the job market and make it harder to build wealth through employment. It is still unclear how this will play out over the long term. But this trend means it is more important than ever for people to acquire equity in public stocks to maintain access to the wealth-creating potential of big businesses. .Let's explore why a $1,000 bet on shares in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Realty Income (NYSE: O) could help investors preserve and grow their portfolios in this rapidly evolving economic landscape..With a market cap of $2.29 trillion, Amazon is already one of the largest companies in the world, and it isn't hard to see why. The diversified technology giant has had its fingers in many different megatrends, ranging from e-commerce to cloud computing, allowing it to achieve an incredible level of scale. Generative AI could unlock the next leg of growth. .Amazon's AI strategy has two parts. One side focuses on providing computing power to other enterprises through its cloud services segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The second involves using AI technology internally to boost business efficiency and customer satisfaction. .According to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon is already using generative AI in ""virtually every corner"" of its operations. Much of these efforts focus on relatively minor improvements like shopping assistants and automated product detail pages. But investors should probably be most excited about the potential for workforce reductions. Management believes AI will allow Amazon to shrink its workforce even further over the coming years, allowing for dramatic profit growth even if its top line plateaus..With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33, Amazon stock trades for a slight premium over the S&P 500's average of 29. But that looks fair, considering the company's dominant brand and profit growth potential..Unlike Amazon, Realty Income probably won't get a massive direct boost from AI technology -- although it has partnered with Digital Realty to build data centers. Nevertheless, the company is an excellent bet in this changing economy because its stable and diversified real estate portfolio helps ensure its business can thrive, no matter what happens.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the 11 must-buy AI stocks analysts are betting on. On June 16, the company’s advertising unit, Amazon Ads, entered a strategic partnership with Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU). The two are joining forces to create the largest authenticated footprint in connected TV..Amazon Ads and Roku are to enable advertisers to reach an estimated 80 million US households through the Amazon demand-side platform. The partnership aims to enable unprecedented precision at scale by allowing markets to access logged-in users across all apps and devices in a way that was not possible before..Early tests following the integration have already shown a 40% increase in unique reach and a 30% reduction in over-frequency. Consequently, advertisers delivered three times more value from their campaigns..Advertisers are set to benefit from better performance, planning, optimization, and measurement due to the extraordinary scale. Addressability across popular streaming apps, such as The Roku Channel, Prime Video, and other top CTV streaming services on Roku and Fire TV operating systems, has also received a boost owing to the exclusive alliance between two industry leaders in CTV..Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started as an online bookselling company. It has since morphed into an internet-based business enterprise that provides cloud computing, digital streaming and AI services, and an e-commerce platform. The platform operates in more than 20 countries worldwide..While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this online retailer have returned +4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%..The consensus earnings estimate of $6.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.15 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-amzn-trending-130004834.html,No risk.

Is It Too Late to Buy NVDA Stock?,Nvidia’s share price has found its mojo back after an indifferent start to the year.,"As the market remains vulnerable to a plethora of uncertainties, it seems that there is one constant: the dominance of chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). The stock, which took a tumble due to China-related issues, primarily related to the emergence of DeepSeek and new tariffs under President Donald Trump, has made a strong comeback and is just about 5% off from its record highs..Touted as the “Godfather of AI” by celebrated tech analyst Dan Ives, CEO Jensen Huang and his company are critical to not only the U.S.’s global prowess in chips, but are increasingly becoming key to diplomatic negotiations..2 Outstanding Stocks Under $50 to Buy and Hold Now.3 ETFs with Dividend Yields of 12% or Higher for Your Income Portfolio.Nvidia’s Bringing Sovereign AI to Germany.

Sign Up Now!.Have investors looking to add Nvidia to their portfolios missed the train, or is there still time to load up on the stock, which is up 8.3% on a YTD basis? Let’s find out..Not even a decade ago, Nvidia was a niche company, mostly popular among gamers for its GPUs. Now, after 10 years its shares have soared more than 28,000%, driving the company to a valuation above $3.5 trillion. Nvidia is also closing in on new record highs as it is just 5% shy of the record $153.13 set early in January..The company that designs and sells advanced chips and software platforms — primarily for AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous systems – counts tech majors such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and nearly every major AI and cloud company as its customer..From hyperscalers to sovereign AI, Nvidia is becoming more and more irreplaceable. Central to this are Nvidia’s Blackwell chips..According to Huang’s keynote at GTC 2025, “The Blackwell architecture significantly enhances AI model training and inference, enabling more efficient and scalable AI applications. And the next evolution of the Nvidia Blackwell AI factory platform, Blackwell Ultra, will be coming to systems in the second half of this year.”.Further bolstering its dominance in the GPU industry, where it already commands a near-monopoly with a-greater-than-90% market share, Nvidia has outlined a compelling product roadmap that is expected to reinforce its leadership position even more firmly. In addition to the Blackwell Ultra platform, the company is progressing toward launching next-generation GPU systems such as the Vera Rubin NVL144, which is anticipated in the second half of 2026, and the Rubin Ultra NVL576, scheduled for release a year later in late 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-quickly-approaching-record-high-113002880.html,No risk.
2025-06-20 19:18:00,Data center spending soared amid rising GPU demand in Q1,"AI infrastructure buildouts drove a 53% increase in capital expenditures, despite some project cancellations and tariff concerns, Dell’Oro Group said.","This story was originally published on CIO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter. .Data center capital expenditures increased 53% year over year to $134 billion during the first three months of 2025, according to Dell’Oro Group research published Tuesday. The spike was driven by a surge in hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure, particularly Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and custom accelerators, the research firm said..The four companies with the largest cloud footprints — AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft — accounted for 44% of Q1 data center capital investments. Enterprise infrastructure spending — the second biggest category — accounted for one-third of the total, according to Dell’Oro..“Despite some project cancellations by U.S. cloud providers, overall CapEx remains on track, with hyperscalers adjusting capacity rather than cutting investments,” Dell’Oro Group Senior Research Director Baron Fung said in the report. “Enterprises, facing tighter budgets and tariff-related risks, are more cautious, prompting slight downward revisions to their CapEx forecasts.”.An ongoing data center building boom sparked by generative AI adoption showed no signs of an early-year slowdown as hyperscalers raced to add compute capacity..Amazon reported $24.3 billion in Q1 capital expenditures, primarily to expand AWS’ AI cloud infrastructure. Microsoft and Google weren’t far behind, reporting $21.4 billion and $17 billion in CapEx for the first three months of the year, respectively..Dell’Oro Group expects the trend to continue. The firm forecasted a 30% year-over-year bump in data center investments for 2025, despite mixed economic signals triggered by tariff concerns and supply chain challenges. Last year, data center infrastructure capital expenditures grew 51% year over year to $455 billion..“Tariff-related uncertainties are not expected to materially alter hyperscaler spending plans given their diversified global supply chains,” Fung said in the report..AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud plan to invest more than $250 billion in buildouts this year, in part to ease capacity constraints and satisfy growing customer demand for AI processing power..“The availability of GPU and supporting infrastructure is supply constrained,” Fung said in an email. “Demand is so strong that the top 4 U.S. cloud service providers have had to turn away smaller customers.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-center-spending-soared-amid-111829996.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Geopolitical Risk

Basically, all the puts would expire worthless and the trader keeps the $215 premium..A tent-shaped profit zone exists between $190 and $200 with the maximum gain occurring at $195 and is around $600..This is what the trade looks like as of today:.You can see the main risk in the trade is a drop in price early on. The blue line is the profit and loss at expiration and the purple line is the T+0 line. T+0 just means “today”..So, we don’t want the stock to get into the profit tent too early..What about in three weeks’ time? How does the trade look then?.Looking a lot better for any price above $195..One advantage of this trade type is it takes advantage of option skew. Notice the contract we are buying has lower volatility (65.16%) than the contract we are selling (64.45%). Buy low, sell high..Not that the trade starts with a delta of 9, which means the initial position is roughly equivalent to being long 9 shares of AMZN stock, although this will change as the trade progresses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ratio-spread-targets-profit-110002445.html,Market Risk

The exchange-traded fund has averaged a compound annual return of more than 18% over the past decade.

These are the types of companies that investors are drawn to because if they're growing, they are expanding their operations and likely innovating and potentially diversifying along the way. .Names like Amazon and Nvidia are two exceptional examples. Over the past 20 years, the former has produced returns of 12,000% while the latter is up more than 60,000%. Investing $30,000 into either one of the stocks back then would have made you millions of dollars. .Picking the next big growth stock is easier said than done. But the good news is that you don't have to pick the next Amazon or Nvidia to achieve great results. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will give you exposure to the top 100 nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq exchange, also known as the Nasdaq 100. Amazon, Nvidia, and many other top tech names are included in that list. .Here's how a $30,000 investment in the fund might grow over the long haul..The best growth stocks in the world are often found on the Nasdaq. And by targeting the top 100 nonfinancial companies, you won't have to worry about keeping an eye on which growth stocks to buy. The Invesco fund will adjust its holdings over time, removing poor-performing stocks and replacing them with rising stars..Some of the top holdings in the ETF today include Costco Wholesale, Netflix, and Broadcom. While it is a tech-heavy fund (tech stocks account for 57% of its holdings), about 20% of the portfolio is also in consumer discretionary stocks, followed by smaller positions in other sectors. And more than 97% of the holdings are U.S. stocks, which can minimize your exposure to international markets..It's little surprise, with so much focus on growth, that the Invesco QQQ Trust widely outperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade. At 430%, it has averaged a compound annual growth rate of more than 18%..As impressive as the Invesco ETF's returns have been over the past decade, they've also been skewed in recent years by a flurry of tech spending, which may not persist in the very long term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-30-000-investment-103000071.html,Market Risk

But the Fed is watching this space closely..Board Governor Michael Barr, in a speech at the Reykjavík Economic Conference last month, outlined a scenario where AI doesn't just inspire incremental progress but overhauls the economy, prompting sweeping social change..""The amazing potential capabilities and breadth of applications associated with AI — many of which are already apparent — make it worth asking whether this time may be different,"" Barr said.

Its Prime members count on that part of the business for their essentials purchases and more. It controls about 40% of the total U.S. e-commerce market, with the next-highest competitor, Walmart, at only around 6%..CEO Andy Jassy said that although it could be affected by new tariffs, shoppers tend to choose retailers they trust when there's uncertainty. And its huge base of sellers and product assortment mean that shoppers are likely to find the items they need at the price they want on its platform..As usual, Amazon reported increasing delivery speed in the 2025 first quarter, and it has made a number of changes to its logistics network to keep that up. It changed from a national network to a regional one, it keeps more of its highest-selling products closer to more shoppers, and uses AI throughout its business to determine fast and cheap shipping options..The company is testing new processes in a pilot distribution center that's cutting 25% of processing time and is on track to deliver 25% cost savings at peak times..E-commerce overall is expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% through 2029, according to Statista, and as the leader in the industry, much of that will land on Amazon's platform..Beyond e-commerce, the company has launched a hugely successful advertising business that leverages its unmatched e-commerce platform for consumer exposure to ads.

2025-06-20 16:51:00,Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Amazon's share price and market cap are likely to increase significantly over the next five years.  Key growth drivers include AI, e-commerce penetration, advertising, and expansion into new markets.  It's definitely the answer to where Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock will be in five years.","Amazon's share price and market cap are likely to increase significantly over the next five years..Key growth drivers include AI, e-commerce penetration, advertising, and expansion into new markets..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.I don't know for sure. That's the answer to many questions I'm asked. It's definitely the answer to where Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock will be in five years..However, I think I have a pretty good overall take on where Amazon stock will be in 2030. If I'm right, the outlook looks highly encouraging for Amazon shareholders..I'll be quite surprised if Amazon's share price isn't significantly higher five years from now. Are we talking about a market cap of $3 trillion? $4 trillion? Even $5 trillion? Maybe, maybe, and maybe..Going back to Amazon's initial public offering in May 1997, there have only been two five-year periods during which the stock didn't deliver strong gains. Both occurred during the dot-com bubble burst in the early 21st century. In most of the other five-year periods in Amazon's history, its share price at least doubled and often skyrocketed threefold or more..As the mutual fund disclosures say, ""Past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future results."" That's true with Amazon (and any other stock, for that matter). In some ways, it gets increasingly difficult for companies like Amazon to extend their successful track records. Delivering robust growth is harder when your market cap is $2.3 trillion than when it's $100 billion..However, I'm reasonably confident predicting that Amazon will be bigger five years from now. Why? The same culture that was largely responsible for the company's success over the last nearly three decades is still in place today..I'll go beyond culture as a reason Amazon should grow significantly, though. There are five specific reasons I think Amazon stock will perform well over the next five years..First, I suspect we've only seen the tip of the iceberg of how artificial intelligence (AI) will transform the world. I expect the second half of this decade will be filled with one AI advance after another. Amazon will probably be one of the companies achieving those advances. And it will almost certainly be a big beneficiary of AI progress, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) ranking as the world's largest cloud services provider..Second, there's more room for Amazon to grow in its core e-commerce business than meets the eye. Sure, e-commerce is no longer new -- and Amazon is already the 800-pound gorilla in the market.

2025-06-20 16:20:00,2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,Both of these stocks will benefit from increased AI spending in the years to come.,"The growth in AI spending is not slowing down, presenting an opportunity for cloud computing stocks..Amazon is the leading cloud provider and is seeing fast revenue growth..Alphabet can benefit from both consumer and cloud AI in the future..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.The artificial intelligence (AI) train shows no signs of slowing down. Spending on the category is expected to grow 5x over the next five years, according to a recent report from Grand View Research. That increased AI spending has been and will continue to be a boon for the cloud computing giants. That's because start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic perform AI model training and run inference for consumer usage through cloud computing systems. And huge capital expenditures on data centers should help growth continue at this blistering pace in 2025..But who are the cloud computing giants benefiting from this AI surge? Two of them happen to be well-known for other reasons and have a history of being millionaire-maker stocks. Here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can continue to be millionaire-maker stocks going forward with the help of AI and the cloud..Amazon is making investments on the consumer side of AI with its e-commerce platform, but the majority of its investments are with its cloud computing division, called Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the premier partner for Anthropic, one of the leading start-ups in the AI space, where Amazon has invested billions of dollars. With these investments, Anthropic will pour money into training and running AI systems on AWS. A long-term partnership such as this will be vital for AWS. Anthropic may spend tens of billions of dollars on cloud computing credits in the years to come..Revenue growth accelerated for AWS in recent quarters as companies flock to the cloud computing leader to host their AI systems. AWS revenue grew 17% year over year last quarter to $29.3 billion, bringing annualized revenue to $117 billion. Profits are soaring because of this spending, sending operating income to $42 billion over the last 12 months just for the AWS segment..Growth should continue in 2025 and beyond. Amazon said it plans to spend $100 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, mostly related to AI at AWS. This increased data center capacity will help revenue keep scaling at a rapid clip. Accompanied by strong profit margins, this will be a huge earnings growth driver for Amazon over the next few years..Add in the durable growth in e-commerce, and Amazon stock looks like a perfect stock to own over the long term. It has a slightly expensive forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35, but that should come down quickly with better margins at e-commerce and steady growth at AWS. Buy Amazon stock and sit tight; you likely will be well rewarded in the future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-millionaire-maker-artificial-intelligence-082000858.html,No risk.

Though these companies have helped shareholders score a major win quarter after quarter and could continue to climb, some investors now are looking beyond these names that have constantly been on center stage. They aim to find the next big AI success story, and one that has emerged in recent times is CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV)..This tech company is new to the market, having launched its initial public offering in March, and the stock already has soared more than 320% from that point. Investors are excited about this new AI investing opportunity, especially considering the company has been delivering triple-digit revenue growth. Could investing $10,000 in CoreWeave make you a millionaire? Let's find out..So, first, let's talk a little bit about this new-to-the-market company that's outperformed well-established tech giants such as the Magnificent Seven companies so far this year. CoreWeave actually is closely linked to the world's most talked-about AI company, Nvidia, and this may be part of the reason why investors are so excited about its future..This company's main business is offering customers access to its giant fleet -- 250,000 to be exact -- of Nvidia chips across more than 30 data centers. These graphics processing units (GPUs) may be rented for long periods of time or simply by hour, offering customers great flexibility for their AI workloads. Since demand has been extremely high, even surpassing supply, for Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture and chip, investors clearly are optimistic about CoreWeave's prospects too. CoreWeave even was the first to make this new architecture generally available to customers, highlighting its ability to serve customers fast with the latest innovations..And the fact that market giant Nvidia holds a 7% stake in CoreWeave is another element that could appeal to investors. Nvidia's backing suggests this young company is set to play a key role in the next phases of the AI story..A look at CoreWeave's growth so far shows great momentum, with revenue soaring more than 400% in the first quarter. And even considering uncertainties in recent months that have pressured the stock market, CoreWeave says customer demand still increased. In fact, the big challenge right now is to scale up and meet demand. This requires significant investment, and that means investors should expect spending to increase moving forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-investing-10-000-coreweave-071500434.html,Investment Risk

The 40% plunge from the same month last year marks a sharp reversal for a booming trade route, coming just as the US government eliminated a long-standing tariff loophole..The policy shift is upending the business models of fast-fashion titan Shein and its rival Temu, which relied on the exemption to send goods directly to US customers free of tariffs. It’s also squeezing thousands of small merchants who relied on the model as a low-cost entry into the world’s largest consumer market..“Without the exemption, it would mean tougher business to us, and much fewer options for consumers, and potentially higher prices,” said Wang Yuhao, whose Kunming-based incense company, Shantivale, recently began selling to the US. “This is a lose-lose situation.”.For the entrepreneur, the new tariffs and logistical fees of direct shipping now would mean losing $2 on every parcel. To avoid the additional cost, Wang said he has pivoted to bulk shipments to US warehouses, a move that demanded an upfront investment of more than 100,000 yuan ($13,800) for inventory and storage..The source of the disruption is the end of the “de minimis” rule exemption for Chinese and Hong Kong shipments. Previously, packages valued under $800 could enter the US duty-free. Since May 2, those parcels face tariffs as high as 54% after the Trump administration moved to close what it deemed an unfair trade loophole..The impact on the largest players was swift. Shein raised US prices on items from dresses to kitchenware ahead of the hike to cover the costs of the higher tariffs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. In the week after the tariffs took effect, both Shein and Temu saw double-digit sales declines, an early sign the punitive measures are eroding their popularity..Even with the drop, the US remained the largest single destination for China’s small parcels, the data showed.

2025-06-19 23:44:00,Netflix vs. Amazon: Which Streaming Giant Has Better Upside Potential?,"NFLX offers superior upside vs AMZN through a focused streaming model, doubling ad revenue potential and strong operating leverage.","As the streaming wars intensify and technology giants vie for consumer attention, Netflix NFLX and Amazon AMZN represent two distinctly different approaches to capturing entertainment dollars. While Netflix has built its empire as a pure-play streaming specialist, Amazon leverages its vast ecosystem encompassing cloud computing, e-commerce, and Prime Video to create a diversified entertainment and technology conglomerate.Both companies reported strong first-quarter 2025 results, with Netflix beating earnings expectations significantly and Amazon demonstrating robust growth across its segments. The streaming landscape continues evolving rapidly, with both companies investing heavily in content, technology, and new revenue streams like advertising and live events.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Netflix's investment thesis centers on its position as the dominant pure-play streaming platform with significant operating leverage and multiple emerging growth drivers. The company's first-quarter 2025 performance demonstrated strong fundamentals, with healthy subscriber growth and robust retention metrics despite economic headwinds. Management emphasized that engagement remains strong, with no significant changes in plan mix or churn patterns, showcasing the platform's resilience.The advertising opportunity represents Netflix's most compelling growth catalyst. The company expects to roughly double its advertising revenues in 2025, driven by its proprietary ad tech platform rollout across markets. With ads currently representing a small fraction of total revenues, this business line offers substantial upside as Netflix expands programmatic capabilities and enhanced targeting features. The ad-supported tier starting at $7.99 provides accessibility during economic uncertainty while creating new monetization avenues.Netflix's content strategy continues to strengthen its competitive moat. Recent announcements include major investments exceeding 1 billion euros in Spain through 2028, new partnerships like the TF1 Group distribution deal in France, and an expanding pipeline of original content across multiple genres and regions. The company's live events strategy, including the successful NFL Christmas games and upcoming Taylor-Serrano fight, demonstrates its ability to create water-cooler moments that drive subscriber acquisition and retention.The gaming initiative, while still nascent, represents another growth vector with minimal cannibalization risk. Netflix's approach focuses on premium, ad-free gaming experiences tied to popular IP, potentially unlocking value from the $140 billion gaming market over time.Management has also set ambitious but achievable targets, including doubling revenues by 2030 and achieving $9 billion in annual advertising revenues by the same year. The company's advertising business represents a significant growth opportunity, with the successful launch of Netflix's Ad Suite in the United States on April 1 and international expansion planned for this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025, creating a new revenue stream that complements its successful subscription model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.32 per share, indicating 27.69% growth year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-vs-amazon-streaming-giant-154400134.html,No risk.

Last year’s two-day event saw consumers spend $14.2 billion, setting a new record for the event, according to data from Adobe Analytics. Prime Day 2024 was subsequently described by Amazon as its “biggest Prime Day shopping event ever.”.But there are certainly headwinds going into the expanded summer 2025 event — and that perhaps explains why consumers seem skittish..A new RetailMeNot survey found that interest in Prime Day should remain strong — 84% of U.S. shoppers say they plan to participate, up from 81% in 2024. But the survey also showed that those shoppers won’t be digging as deep into their wallets, with the anticipated spend at Amazon being $242 during the event, a decline of $58 from the previous year..Polls conducted by MarketWatch on various social-media platforms Tuesday showed limited enthusiasm for a four-day Prime Day event. On X, far more respondents said they were “not interested” in the extended sale versus those who said they “love” the idea.
