2025-06-24 05:49:00,X Adds More Sports Engagement Options to Maintain Community Engagement,X is looking to ensure it doesn't lose sports discussion to Threads.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .With Meta making a bigger push to lure sports communities over to its apps, X is looking to fight back, by adding various new sports engagement options which it hopes will enhance game day interaction in the app..X has been working on this since November last year, when it launched its new “NFL Portal” element, which is designed to make it easier for users to stay up to date with key discussions around live NFL matches..As you can see in this example, the NFL Portal brings together posts from NFL teams, as well as key commentators, while also providing access to game schedules, live scores and stats..X added the same for NBA matches in April this year:.And in the last week, X has also added some additional sports engagement elements, including updated share cards for sports games, and new score tracker notes on relevant posts..I mean, maybe you wouldn’t want that, if you were hoping to catch the replay, but if you’re looking up the event hashtag, you’re likely fine with the score being spoiled..X users can also dock conversations about a live match, so they can keep on top of the discussion while X’s video feed provides another means to share highlights in-stream. .X will be hoping that this enhanced focus on sports discussion will prompt more engagement, and keep its top sports communities from migrating to other platforms instead..Because as noted, Meta’s making a push for this audience as well. .Meta already has a deal in place with the UFC, which will see exclusive, live content shared to Threads, while Threads now also has its own live score displays for in progress sporting events, which is a first step towards a similar game day hub like X..Meta has also made a specific point of highlighting that sports discussion is rising fast in the app, with some sports-related communities growing by millions in a matter of months. And amid the recent NBA Finals fanfare, Threads also hosted a live chat with ESPN’s Malika Andrews to promote the event..In combination, you can see how Threads is looking to make inroads with this key discussion element, as another effort to put pressure on X. .And given that sports is the biggest topic of discussion on X, that makes a lot of sense:.The fact that X is now looking to add more sports engagement elements, and fast, suggests that Threads likely is making some progress on this front, and building its own sports-based communities, causing engagement challenges for the app. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/x-adds-more-sports-engagement-204954862.html," The primary risk associated with this news article is the potential loss of market share in the sports engagement space due to competition from Threads. This could lead to decreased user base for X, affecting their growth and revenue. It is categorized as a competitive risk.  **Risk Type:** Competitive Risk"
2025-06-24 04:38:00,Update: Market Chatter: US House Bans Meta's WhatsApp From Government Devices on Security Concerns,(Updates with US chief administrative officer's response in the sixth and seventh paragraphs.) Th,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-chatter-us-house-bans-203846671.html," The news about the U.S. House banning Meta's WhatsApp on government devices due to security concerns presents several types of risks:  1. **Legal Risks**: The ban introduces potential legal issues such as fines, penalties, and regulatory actions if compliance is not met.  2. **Reputational Risks**: This could harm Meta's international reputation as consumers using WhatsApp elsewhere would be aware of the U.S. ban.  3. **Operational Disruption**: The ban may affect Meta's business operations in the U.S., particularly affecting their partnerships and integrations with U.S. government agencies.  4. **International Market Risks**: While primarily a U.S.-based issue, it could impact international users if changes are made elsewhere or if Meta rebrands/redirects services globally.  5. **Regulatory Compliance Costs**: The ban may lead to increased compliance costs for Meta in terms of securing official devices and adjusting business models.  6. **Strategic Risks**: Meta might need significant investments in security patches and compliance measures, which could be costly and time-consuming.  In summary, the risk is moderate to high due to legal, reputational, operational, and strategic implications that could affect Meta's global presence and financial health."

2025-06-24 04:53:00,How Social Platforms Measure Video Views [Infographic],A handy listing to ensure that you're tracking the right data points.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Another aspect of Meta’s recent shift to re-categorize all videos posted to the app (except live-streams) as Reels is that this will also change how Meta counts views for non-Reels clips..Up till the announcement, Meta counted Facebook video views (non-Reels) at 3 seconds of view time, meaning that the video needed to be on-screen and playing for 3-seconds, at least, to register as a view. But now, Meta’s bringing this into line with Reels measurement, with video views to be counted basically as soon as the video begins playing. .Which, as Mondo Metrics chief Nick Cicero points out, means that, now, every major social platform counts a video view after a second..Well except LinkedIn (2 seconds), while regular YouTube video views (everything but Shorts) are still counted at 30 seconds. 30 seconds feels like a more viable measure of attention and engagement, and it also worth noting that most platforms do also provide 2-second and 3-second view counts within their ad metrics, as well as completion rates to provide more context. But it is important for social media managers to understand what that view count data actually means, and represents, in real world terms. .To keep you up to speed, Nick Cicero has published this updated overview of how each platform measures a view for quick reference..You can get more info on each at:.Snapchat.Instagram.X.Facebook.TikTok.YouTube.LinkedIn.Or the team from Mondo Metrics can provide more in-depth insight..Because as Cicero notes:.“Views are cheap. Attention is expensive.”.Worth taking note of what you’re actually measuring in this respect.  ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-platforms-measure-video-views-195347777.html," The news article ""How Social Platforms Measure Video Views"" does not present significant risks. The article is intended to provide users and marketers with information on how to track video performance ethically and legally. While there are inherent concerns about privacy if measurement techniques are intrusive, the article's focus is on legitimate marketing practices. There is no indication of data manipulation or unethical use of the information provided. Therefore, it does not pose a risk unless it inadvertently offers strategies that could be exploited.  **Conclusion: No Risk**"

While Bitcoin briefly fell from $103,000 to $100,000, it never dropped below the $100,000 mark, unlike in previous cycles..As of June 23, Bitcoin's 60-day realized volatility had fallen to approximately 27% to 28%, according to Bitwise Europe's André Dragosch, which is lower than the S&P 500, which declined by 30%, the NASDAQ 100 by approximately 35%, and ""Magnificent 7"" by 40%..Join the discussion with Scott Melker on the Roundtable here..The ""Magnificent Seven"" are the top seven U.S. tech stocks that have performed exceptionally well: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla..However, this is not a one-off situation for Bitcoin. Historically speaking, Bitcoin's volatility has been the lowest..In February 2022, Bitcoin hit volatility levels of 60% to 65% during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, showing a stark difference from the current pattern, per data available on Glassnode..Analysts also suggest that the difference is mainly attributed to long-term holders and the use of institutional investors..Join the discussion with Mario Nawfal on the Roundtable here. .According to the Glassnode data, over 30% of Bitcoin's circulating supply is controlled by just 216 centralized entities — like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, crypto exchanges, and corporate treasuries — compared to long-term holders, who now control a record 14.53 million BTC..Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, believes the price trajectory for BTC will remain bullish, supported by both central bank policies and investor confidence..At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $101,197.17, up by 2.16% in the last 24 hours, as per Kraken's price feed..US stocks aren’t safe in heated global tensions anymore first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 23, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 23, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-aren-t-safe-194500568.html," The risk associated with the news is categorized as **market risk**. This arises from the increased exposure of US stocks to global tensions, which can lead to market volatility and instability. While Bitcoin's reduced volatility due to long-term holder sentiment may mitigate some risks in the short term, the primary concern stems from the heightened riskiness of US equities during periods of geopolitical stress."

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the best QQQ stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On June 19, Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating for Meta while increasing the price target from $676 to $807. The adjustment was made by analyst Deepak Mathivanan, who signals strong confidence in Meta’s future growth potential..Meta is now focused on integrating advertisements into WhatsApp’s Updates tab, which improved Mathivanan’s outlook on the company as he believes that the move will unlock new revenue streams for Meta without compromising user experience. He also highlighted new ad formats, such as ‘Promoted Channels’ and ‘Status Ads.’.Mathivanan estimates that if ad adoption reaches even 5% of the current levels seen on Instagram and Facebook, it could substantially impact Meta’s earnings by FY2027. WhatsApp has a user base of over 3 billion monthly users globally, with 82% of monthly users active daily, viewing an average of 50 stories. Given this engagement, even a small increase in ad presence is expected to boost Meta’s earnings shortly..Meta Platforms Inc.

Any challenges or regulatory issues with this model could negatively impact the company's performance and thus its stock price.  3. **External Macroeconomic Factors**: The upgrade might not account for broader economic conditions such as interest rates or inflation, which could affect Meta's operations if these factors decline.  In conclusion, while the confidence in Meta's future growth is positive, investors should consider the associated risks of market volatility and potential challenges from WhatsApp ad monetization."
2025-06-24 02:21:00,Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Says the Technology They’re Developing Will ‘See What You See and Hear What You Hear’,"Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for Meta’s AI strategy centers on deeply personalized, conversational assistants — an approach shaped by his history of consumer-focused innovation and the company’s vast social data ecosystem.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms (META), has consistently steered his company toward the intersection of technology and human connection. In discussing Meta’s artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, he gave some unique insights into where he thinks AI is heading in general, as well as where he plans to steer the $1.75 trillion tech giant..""On the consumer side, we’re very focused on personal AI. Right more than kind of productivity. So, you know, what is that? It's going to be probably more conversational, probably index a little bit more towards voice, be more personalized,” Zuckerberg said in a recent interview. He continued, “I think people are going to want a system that gets to know them well and that kind of understands them in the way their feed algorithms do and honestly that they don't have to ramp up from scratch because it's already connected to some of that stuff.”.Is Tesla a Buy or Sell as TSLA Stock Zooms on Austin Robotaxi Launch?.The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..These 3 Stocks Have Been Hot in 2025. Should You Sell Them Now Before It’s Too Late?.Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!.While smartphones would probably be the ideal way to integrate AI into a user’s life, Zuckerberg is pursuing a different approach entirely: Glasses. It doesn’t seem like the tech mogul believes smartphones are going away, but rather that glasses will be the next frontier of wearable technology. Smartphones are likely too competitive, and Meta would be vastly too late to the game. Even giants like Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are still struggling to break into the smartphone market, despite investing billions of dollars and dedicating years of work. Instead, Meta is by far the leader in the wearable glasses space, and can carve out a niche for itself while it looks to break into the hardware industry and find some real-life use cases for its AI ventures..Zuckerberg laid out his vision for the future, saying: “As you walk through the world, and you have your glasses, glasses are kind of the perfect form factor for AI, because you let an AI see what you see and hear what you hear and talk to you throughout the day, it should all just kind of get to know you. And it shouldn't be like every time you do a query, you're just starting from scratch and you need to provide it all of the details."".This philosophy is rooted in Zuckerberg’s long-standing emphasis on user-centric design and his belief in technology’s ability to enhance daily life. Under his leadership, Meta has evolved from a social networking platform into a technology conglomerate at the forefront of AI, virtual reality, and wearable devices.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-mark-zuckerberg-says-technology-182139982.html," The article on Meta's AI strategy outlines an advanced approach centered around personalized interactions inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's background in consumer innovation and their social data ecosystem. While the technology holds promise for enhanced personalization and accessibility, it also presents several significant risks:  1. **Privacy Concerns**: The extensive access to user data could lead to increased surveillance, raising privacy issues as users may not be fully informed about data collection.  2. **Bias in AI Algorithms**: Potential biases from a socioconomically diverse dataset could amplify existing inequalities and spread misinformation, affecting societal well-being.  3. **Mistrust and Lack of Control**: Users might not understand the extent of data processing, leading to mistrust and loss of control over their personal information.  4. **Regulatory Challenges**: Navigating global privacy regulations can be complex and costly for Meta as it expands internationally.  5. **Ethical Implications Beyond Bias**: Issues include consent, transparency about data sharing, and psychological aspects affecting trust in the company.  In summary, while Meta's AI strategy has many benefits, it poses risks related to privacy, bias, control, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations that need careful management."

All seven stocks are included in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, and they often drive the market's performance with their size, growth, and influence..But after years of big gains, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their luster. Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which is vulnerable to high tariffs, competition, and supply chain constraints. Amazon faces stiff competition from cheaper cross-border competitors, Alphabet's Google is being slammed by antitrust regulators and struggling to keep pace with OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) services, and Microsoft might be headed for an ugly breakup with OpenAI as the AI start-up openly rebels against its top investor. As for Tesla, Elon Musk's divisive actions are likely driving away its potential customers in the saturated EV market..Meta and Nvidia face fewer near-term headwinds than the other five stocks. However, Meta generates nearly all of its revenue from ads, and its growth could slow down as the global economy cools off. Nvidia certainly isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but the secular expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset a lot of that pressure. So looking ahead, I believe Nvidia will continue to shatter Wall Street's expectations and outperform the other Magnificent Seven stocks for the foreseeable future..Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. It designs its own chips, but it outsources its manufacturing to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. With that ""fabless"" model, Nvidia doesn't need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade its own foundries or develop the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient manufacturing nodes..Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, which can also be used to mine certain cryptocurrencies. But in its latest quarter, it generated less than 9% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs. A whopping 89% came from its data center GPUs -- which include its older A100 chips and current-gen H100 and H200 chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/predict-magnificent-seven-stock-crush-163300908.html," The news about Nvidia's stock potentially outperforming while others in the ""Magnificent Seven"" group decline reflects **sector-specific risk**. This situation highlights potential volatility and uncertainty within the semiconductor sector, where unexpected performance can lead to market instability or shifts in investor sentiment, affecting both those holding the outperforming stock positively and others negatively."

Together, they make up the “Prominent 10.""","Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S..It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy..Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%..Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI..But what about China?.Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services..Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years..The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC..E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/move-over-magnificent-7-goldman-094217732.html," The primary risk associated with Goldman Sachs' promotion of the ""Prom 10"" list of Chinese stocks is **market risk**.

2025-06-23 13:00:00,How to avoid finance scams on social media,A significant proportion of 'finfluencers' are actually criminals using you to make money — so here's what to look out for.,"Financial influencers or ""finfluencers"" have always existed, it’s just that while they used to be bank managers, journalists and people’s parents, now they could be anyone with a phone and a TikTok account. Social media has become the go-to resource for investment ideas for a significant number of people aged 18-34..One in five (22%) say they get investment ideas from Instagram, while a similar number get them from Facebook (19%) and Reddit (18%), according to research by Hargreaves Lansdown. Meanwhile, one in six people in this age group get investment ideas from X and the same number from TikTok..Some of these finfluencers will be reliable, regulated experts posting on social media in a professional capacity. However, many will be people who lack the knowledge and experience to give a complete picture, so risk leading investors astray..Read more: Why you can trust an 18-year old with their junior ISA – and how to create one.If you’re seeing this kind of content online, ask yourself whether your expert really knows their onions. It can feel like a social media influencer, operating outside the financial services industry, has uncovered a hack that breaks all the rules of finances to give you a head start. However, they may have misunderstood something — or they’re deliberately misleading you. The same rules apply to us all — higher potential rewards always come with more risk..A significant proportion of finfluencers are actually criminals, using you to make money. Some will post videos showing luxury lifestyles, and encourage people to sign up to a WhatsApp group where they will apparently share the secrets of investing success. Others use deepfakes of well-known people in the industry, including Hargreaves Lansdown founder Peter Hargreaves or celebrities like MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis or entrepreneur Steven Bartlett to get people to sign up to scam WhatsApp groups..These might be ""pump and dump"" schemes, in which the criminals invest in very small stocks, then they put people under pressure to invest too — in order to push the price up. Once the value has risen, the criminals sell up and run, leaving investors with big losses, and in some cases with worthless stocks. Another version of this approach is to persuade you to pay fees or commission in return for their ""tips""..Investment companies proactively identify any scams using their name and contact social media companies to take them down. However, so-called fan pages are more difficult to tackle..Social media companies need to make it easier to stop these fraudsters, but in the interim we need to be alert to the risks. It’s worth knowing that Hargreaves Lansdown founders Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown are not on social media. They don’t have WhatsApp groups and neither does the company.

In conclusion, while the move has potential benefits, it involves significant risks that could impact employee retention and overall company performance if not managed carefully."

That's enough to make a significant difference for your retirement or whatever else you're investing for..With $50,000 to invest, you'll likely want to find stocks that can deliver growth, but with relatively low risk. Luckily, there are a number of stocks available on the market that embody those characteristics. Keep reading to see two of them..Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) may be the best example of a business that can burn through billions in cash on a side project, but is still overwhelmingly successful..Meta has lost more than $60 billion on its metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI)-focused division, Reality Labs. But the success of its advertising business and the growth of its family of apps division has more than made up for it..Over the last three years, the stock is up more than 300%. It's fended off a threat from TikTok with its Reels. Meta's AI tools are also helping the company better monetize its ad inventory and help its advertisers use AI for images and ad copy..Meta effectively has a duopoly in digital advertising with Alphabet, but it's outgrowing its large rival. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 16% to $42.3 billion, and Meta reported an operating profit of $17.5 billion, or an operating margin of 41%..The company benefits from a dream business model where it sells ads on user-generated content, and has more than 3 billion daily active users across its apps, primarily including Facebook and Instagram..Meta's wide-moat advantage in digital advertising and social media isn't likely to go anywhere, and the business should continue to experience solid growth as long as the economy is healthy..Meta is also a top AI competitor. Meta AI's chatbot now has nearly 1 billion users, giving it the biggest user base of any AI platform. The company's deal with Scale AI should also accelerate its AI ambitions..Finally, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27, which looks like a great valuation for a company growing at its pace..Overall, Meta combines solid growth, wide profit margins, a strong competitive advantage, and a good valuation, making it a great stock for a large investment.

Earlier this month, it invested a total of $14.3 billion in Scale AI to take a 49% non-voting stake in the company and bring key personnel into Meta's laboratories. Despite the significant changes this brings to Meta and the industry, it's not what makes the stock a buy today..Artificial intelligence is extremely important to the future of Meta Platforms, and the potential impact of the technology still seems to be underappreciated by the market. Meta's stock price is attractive, and it would be a buy whether it made the move to invest in Scale AI or not..Scale AI provides curated and labeled data sets to frontier model developers for AI training. It can also provide evaluation and help improve reasoning models with the help of human experts. It works with many of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, providing key services to ensure they can put out the best products..Meta's investment includes a commercial agreement to spend $450 million per year on Scale's platform. Meta will likely gain access to proprietary data sets in an industry where good data has become incredibly important. More importantly, though, it brings Scale's founder and CEO Alexandr Wang onto Meta's payroll, where he'll head up a new AI ""superintelligence"" lab..Meta has struggled to attract top talent to its AI labs, and the disappointing results of its latest Llama AI model release have made the talent gap more clear. It reportedly offered huge incentive packages to poach OpenAI employees in an effort to win over talent to catch back up with the competition, but most rejected it. With its investment in Scale, Meta is hoping it can correct that issue..Building a leading-edge model is important for Meta, even though it provides its Llama models to the open-source community, albeit with restrictions for commercial use. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is more interested in the potential the most advanced AI systems could bring to Meta's existing products instead of making a product out of the AI model itself. But to build the best model with the most capabilities, it needs wide adoption from the developer community, and that won't happen if its performance is subpar.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-meta-platforms-massive-14-140500538.html," The $14.3 billion AI investment by Meta Platforms presents several key risks:  1. **Speculative Nature**: This is a high-risk move as it involves significant financial expenditure in an emerging technology whose outcomes are unpredictable.  2. **Potential Underperformance**: There's uncertainty about whether AI will achieve the expected growth and integration into Meta's business, especially if the technology doesn't reach the market as anticipated or isn't adopted widely.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: The regulatory landscape surrounding AI development can be complex and could impose new challenges, such as data privacy issues or algorithmic bias concerns, potentially delaying progress or increasing costs.  4. **Competition**: Established tech giants like Google and Amazon are also investing heavily in AI, which could intensify competition and affect Meta's market position and investment returns.  5. **Market Concentration**: This is a pure risk because the company is heavily invested in one sector (AI), making its performance highly sensitive to broader market changes within that industry.  In conclusion, the primary risks are categorized under high financial speculation, potential underperformance, regulatory challenges, competition, and market concentration, indicating significant uncertainty with no guarantee of positive outcomes."

As of this writing, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Index are up 2%, up 1%, and down 1%, respectively, year to date..So, as attention turns to the second half of 2025, three Fool.com contributing analysts have selected their top buys within the technology sector: Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Here's why..Jake Lerch (Reddit): 2025 has been an up-and-down year for Reddit stock. As of this writing, it's down 13% year to date. However, the stock has been extremely volatile throughout the year. It's been up as much as 37% and down by almost 46%..So, obviously, Reddit isn't a stock for every investor or investment portfolio. That said, growth-oriented investors willing to hold for years might want to take the stock's recent volatility as an opportunity to accumulate shares. .Reddit is a social media stock. It boasts more than 108 million daily average users and is growing fast. As of its most recent quarterly report (for the three months ended on March 31), the company's revenue growth stood at 61%..The company makes money through selling ad space, like its much larger social media rival, Meta Platforms. While Meta's ad ecosystem has existed for more than a decade and now draws in about a half-billion dollars per day, Reddit's ad ecosystem remains in its infancy..This creates a possibility for investors. Meta has already proven that the social media advertising model works -- and works very well. Meta has ridden that model to a staggering market capitalization of $1.7 trillion. Reddit, on the other hand, has a market cap of only $26 billion..In a move that mirrors Meta, Reddit recently announced plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ad tools into its network. This strategy could help marketers increase return on investment (ROI) by improving ad targeting and content. .With its large, increasing user base and blistering revenue growth, there's every reason to think Reddit's long-term prospects remain bright -- and its stock price will rise.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-tech-stocks-second-123000937.html," The news about Meta Platforms advertising on WhatsApp introduces several key risks:  1. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Potential antitrust issues or data privacy regulations could lead to legal challenges, impacting Meta's revenue and growth.  2. **User Backlash**: The move might result in criticism from users, potentially damaging investor confidence and affecting the company's reputation.  3. **Content Moderation and Trust**: Using WhatsApp for advertising may affect how content is managed, risking user trust if issues arise with moderating content on both platforms.  4. **Market Sentiment**: Investor uncertainty due to mixed market reactions (S&P 500 up, Dow down) could reflect broader concerns about growth stocks, including Meta's position.  Overall, while the move offers immediate revenue benefits, it carries significant risks related to regulation, user sentiment, and potential reputational issues."

While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years.  The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years.","Amazon has a clear path toward a $3 trillion market cap through its cloud computing growth and AI investments..While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years..The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.While not all have stayed there, there have been three tech giants that have crossed the $3 trillion market cap threshold: Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html," Based on the information provided, I will analyze the type of risk associated with this news article reflecting on the potential risks related to the growth of the three tech giants mentioned.  ### Risk Type: **Speculative or High-Risk Investment**  The article suggests that these companies could potentially reach a market cap of $3 trillion, which is a significant milestone. However, there are inherent risks associated with such speculative investments:  1. **Market Concentration**: The article highlights Amazon's reliance on cloud computing and AI as pathways to reaching the $3 trillion mark. While these technologies are promising, they also represent concentrated exposure in specific areas (e.g., AWS for Amazon). If AWS faces regulatory headwinds or economic downturns, it could negatively impact Amazon's valuation.  2. **Diversification Challenges**: Alphabet and Meta Platforms have diversified portfolios, but their success depends on the continued growth of their respective businesses (e.g., Google/YouTube for Alphabet, gaming/social media platforms for Meta). If these core businesses face slower-than-expected growth or regulatory challenges, it could impact their market valuation.  3. **Technology Risks**: The reliance on emerging technologies like AI and cloud computing introduces risks. These technologies are still evolving, and their widespread adoption depends on factors such as cost reduction, accessibility, and competition from other players in the space.  4. **Regulatory Environment**: The growth of these companies is also dependent on regulatory favorable environments. For example, data privacy concerns (as mentioned with Google/YouTube) could lead to stricter regulations that impact advertising or platform operations, affecting their market valuations.  5. **Market Volatility**: Given the speculative nature of reaching such a high market cap, there is potential volatility in the stock prices of these companies. Market sentiment can swing rapidly based on new developments, earnings reports, or external events (e.g., geopolitical issues, economic downturns).  ### Conclusion: While the article presents optimistic outlooks for these companies, investors should remain cautious due to the speculative nature of reaching a $3 trillion market cap and the associated risks outlined above. A thorough risk assessment, including diversification strategies and careful portfolio management, is recommended before making investment decisions based on this news."

This is because:  1. **Market Volatility and Correction**: Investors may perceive a market correction as tech stocks might be overvalued, leading to potential price drops across other sectors if the market reacts negatively.  2. **Diversification Impact**: While moving to consumer staples or international stocks aims to reduce exposure to tech-specific risks, these sectors still carry their own volatilities (e.g., foreign exchange risks) and may not inherently be lower risk.  3. **Sentiment-Induced Shifts**: The shift reflects investor sentiment rather than a specific sector's performance, indicating broader market dynamics and potential systematic factors affecting the market as a whole.  Thus, the primary risk is systematic, involving potential market-wide volatility or correction, which could impact multiple sectors beyond just tech."

However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain.

2025-06-22 15:06:00,The Stock Split Announcement All of Wall Street Is Waiting for Is Back on the Table -- and It's Not Netflix or Costco!,This industry-leading business is the only one of its elite peers that hasn't completed a stock split before.,"Investors typically gravitate toward companies announcing and completing forward stock splits..Three brand-name, non-tech stocks have completed forward splits in 2025 -- and there's more to picking out which company is next to split than a high share price..The logical candidate to split its stock next is a cash cow with a sustainable moat whose shares are, once again, within a stone's throw of an all-time high..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Although the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the premier attention-grabber for investors on Wall Street over the last two-plus years, it's far from the only trend responsible for lifting the broader market to new heights..Since 2024 began, the market's major stock indexes have been propelled by some of the most influential businesses announcing and completing stock splits..A stock split allows a publicly traded company the opportunity to cosmetically adjust its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. These changes are superficial in the sense that they don't affect a company's market cap or in any way impact its underlying operating performance..Splits can move a company's share price up or down, but there's a sizable variance in how these two types of splits are perceived by the investing community. Reverse splits, which increase a company's share price, are normally shunned by investors. Reverse splits are often enacted by struggling companies that are attempting to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange..In comparison, investors typically love public companies that complete forward splits, which are designed to lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who can't buy fractional shares through their brokers. The businesses undertaking forward splits usually have rich histories of recurring profitability..While three brand-name businesses have taken the plunge and become the latest stock-split stocks this year, the split announcement that all of Wall Street is waiting for is officially back on the table..Last year, more than a dozen high-profile companies announced a split, and a number of these companies were high-growth AI stocks, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Super Micro Computer, and Palo Alto Networks..The ""Class of 2025"" stock-split stocks all come from outside the tech sector..Wholesale industrial and construction supplies company Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST) was the first to cross the proverbial finish line by completing a 2-for-1 forward split after the close of trading on May 21. This was the ninth time since Fastenal's initial public offering in 1987 that it's completed a forward split, and it's a clear indication that the company's strong cyclical ties and on-site innovations are helping to strengthen its relationship with core clients.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-announcement-wall-street-070600030.html," The risk associated with the company's potential stock split involves several factors:  1. **Dilution of Ownership**: While a stock split naturally dilutes ownership, multiple splits can negatively impact investor sentiment and perceptions.  2. **Market Perception**: Compared to peers that have performed stock splits, this could affect investor perception, potentially positioning the company as less active or forward-thinking.  3. **Operational Complexity**: Increased trading activity due to more shares might enhance liquidity but could also lead to higher transaction costs and complexity.  4. **Regulatory and Market Conditions**: Potential complexities in executing a split due to recent market conditions or regulatory factors.  5. **Earnings Per Share Impact**: Changes in EPS could affect investor expectations regarding dividends or buybacks, potentially impacting investor confidence.  Overall, while the stock split offers benefits like increased accessibility, it carries risks related to dilution and market perception that require careful management by the company."

For these investors, NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR), Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG), and Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) look like smart choices to power their portfolios..Long gone are the days of massive nuclear power plants that require enormous capital investments and take years to construct. Nowadays, companies like NuScale Power are developing small modular reactors (SMRs) that offer a variety of advantages over conventional nuclear power plants..For one, SMRs require considerably smaller footprints, making them more attractive to project developers, which can scale these reactors to their individual site's needs. And SMRs have improved safety profiles including the ability to shut down and self-cool indefinitely, unlike traditional nuclear power plants. Among other advantages, NuScale's SMRs are built in a factory, which helps to keep costs down and expedite project development..With $491 million in cash and no debt, the company is on strong financial footing, an appealing situation for those looking to balance a quality growth stock that's not rife with risk. To state its competitive advantage over other SMR providers, NuScale Power says that it's the only near-term deployable SMR company with design approval from the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission..While Constellation Energy's portfolio includes about 10 gigawatts (GWs) of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets, it's nuclear energy that represents the lion's share of its generating capacity -- about 21 GWs, or enough power to meet the demands of 16 million homes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-profit-upcoming-nuclear-163300649.html," The news article discusses companies involved in nuclear power projects, specifically NuScale Power and Cameco, which could benefit from the upcoming nuclear energy boom.

Uh, they're, they've got Patrick Mahomes as one of the, the leading spokespeople, uh, who's advertising for this. And, uh, essentially, it's more or less the same as you would get out of the, the Ray-Ban meta sunglasses where you, you can speak to an AI assistant. Uh, you have built-in cameras, you have built-in, uh, speakers, so you, you can listen to music, uh, that directly into your ears. Uh, but it's the, the new style, it's the, the Oakley Houston style, uh, of sunglasses. So you're going to get that, that new look, uh, new design, uh, potentially bringing a, a new market. They're, they're basically saying that this is great for sports. Uh, you can ask things like, if you're golfing, what the wind direction and speed are, uh, and it'll give you the, the information on that so that you can adjust your shot.

And then the regular version, uh, will be $3.99. So that's a lot of cash for some shades, though Oakleys obviously aren't cheap, Ray-Bans aren't cheap either. So, if you want to get the AI element here, and this is all part, uh, of Meta's push into AI smart glasses. The, the thinking here is that Meta is looking for the next type of big product after the smartphone. They are leaning more into smart glasses. Uh, Google, obviously, also in there as well, Apple, reportedly, uh, in there. Some people think that it'll just be, uh, a peripheral for the smartphone, others like Meta seem to think it will be that gadget. So we'll just have to wait and see if more people, uh, go ahead and purchase these types of devices. Meta's already said they sold millions of units of the Ray-Ban, though.

It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $5.75, marking a 11.43% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $44.37 billion, indicating a 13.55% upward movement from the same quarter last year..For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $25.25 per share and a revenue of $185.98 billion, signifying shifts of +5.83% and +13.06%, respectively, from the last year..Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential..Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system..The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This represents a discount compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 27.94..Also, we should mention that META has a PEG ratio of 1.71.

This situation presents several types of risk:  1. **Investor Confidence Risk**: Investors may lose confidence in Meta's performance, affecting their portfolios and leading to potential sell-offs.  2. **Diversification Impact**: For diversified investors, this risk is relatively minor, but for those heavily invested in Meta, it could necessitate strategic adjustments.  3. **Sectoral Pressure**: The tech sector may face increased scrutiny as investors seek out better-performing stocks, potentially shifting allocations within the industry.  4. **Potential Performance Concerns**: Investors might anticipate future underperformance or earnings issues if current trends continue.  In conclusion, while the risk is present for individual investors and institutional portfolios alike, it primarily affects those with a significant exposure to Meta.

Dan, what do we know about this aggressive strategy here for meta to really bolster its AI operations? .Yeah, Brad. This is all about the kind of war for talent ensuring that Meta has the highest level of researchers and just people who are in the know in the AI spaces possible. So, Daniel Gross, obviously he co-founded Super Safe Intelligence with Ilya Sutskever, who also, by the way, co-founded OpenAI. He also was part of AlexNet. That's uh Ilya. That was basically the thing that helped kick off all of the the AI AI model kind of growth out. This guy is prolific. They they wanted to originally according to these reports, buy safe Super Intelligence, but they were rebuffed. And so Meta then went after Gross to to bring him on board. He's doing that as well as Nat Friedman and he's investing or they're investing Meta that is in their own little their little their own portfolio of AI companies.

For Meta, it's part of, you know, one company that's pouring billions of dollars into this. Meta is not happy with the the state of its llama 4 models right now. They're not the only ones that are pouring billions of dollars. Microsoft, uh OpenAI though, that relationship is reportedly souring. Microsoft and OpenAI though say that that's not true. You also have Amazon pouring billions and billions in with their own chips and you have Google with its own investments that are going on. They have Google Deep Mind. They've been moving around some of their pieces there. So, you know, it really is kind of a race to the top to see who can hire who and at what point they'll be able to kind of take the crown from essentially OpenAI still at this point, but with with these investments, you know, Meta clearly trying to say, look, we're we're not going to sit back, we're not going to sit by. We have the the capabilities, we have the the war chest and we're going to go out there and we're going to try to hire whoever we can to try to dethrone OpenAI. .Dan, thanks so much, tracking all the developments and the investments. We're going to continue this conversation in a hot moment. Thanks. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/metas-big-ai-hiring-push-145855745.html," The analysis of Meta's AI hiring push reveals several key points:  1. **Potential Benefits**:     - Enhanced AI capabilities could lead to significant advancements in social media features, AR/VR, and recommendation systems, improving user experience.  2. **Regulatory Scrutiny**:     - Increased dependence on AI may expose Meta to stricter regulations from various governments on data privacy, AI ethics, and competition with other tech giants, leading to legal challenges.  3. **Market Competition**:    - Other companies investing heavily in AI could intensify competition, potentially resulting in lower-quality products or price pressures affecting profitability.  4. **Overreliance Risk**:    - Excessive focus on AI might lead to neglect of critical areas like user safety and content moderation, risking long-term sustainability and brand reputation.  5. **Talent Mismatch**:    - Without proper integration or strategic planning for new hires, there's a risk that AI projects may not meet expectations, causing financial losses without desired returns.  6. **Financial Strain**:    - Potential overspending on AI without clear ROI could strain Meta's finances and divert resources from other important initiatives.  In conclusion, while Meta's AI push offers growth opportunities, the primary risks involve regulatory issues, market competition, overreliance, talent mismatch, and financial strain if not managed effectively."

However, that thinking seemed to reverse itself this week in response to talk that Alphabet, Scale AI's biggest customer, could be looking for a new data labeling provider..Scale AI is much bigger than Innodata, meaning any customers that leave it could present a big opportunity for Innodata if it can grab that market share..The AI boom has been dominated by large-cap stocks like the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but Innodata shows that there are small-cap stocks capitalizing on the opportunity as well..Innodata is growing quickly with 120% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, and the stock trades at a reasonable valuation. For investors looking for lesser-known AI stock, Innodata is worth a closer look..Before you buy stock in Innodata, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Innodata wasn’t one of them.

Initially, investors may have been concerned about potential competition from Scale AI, which could impact Innodata's growth and market position. The strategic deal between Meta and Scale AI might have alleviated these concerns, leading to increased investor confidence and a rise in Innodata's stock price. This suggests that the risk related to competitive pressures has either been addressed or resolved by this development. Therefore, the type of risk classified is **competitive risk** within the AI sector."

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.75 per share, indicating a change of +11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.25 points to a change of +5.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.58 indicates a change of +9.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-meta-platforms-130005300.html," The analysis of the news regarding Meta Platforms, Inc.

In the first quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ advertising revenues increased 16.2% year over year to $42.3 billion, driven by a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% increase in average ad price. Meanwhile, Alphabet reported revenues of $66.9 billion, up 8.5% year over year, driven by 9.8% growth in Search revenues and 10.3% growth in YouTube ad revenues. According to eMarketer’s latest projection, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are expected to hit revenues of $209.15 billion (Facebook $116.53 billion and Instagram $67.27 billion) and $183.8 billion (Google $189.74 billion and YouTube $19.42 billion), respectively. Higher tariffs are expected to hurt digital ad spending, which is expected to increase at least 1.5% year over year in 2025. Per the latest dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts report, global ad spending is expected to grow 4.9% in 2025 to hit $992 billion, while digital ad spend is anticipated to grow 7.9% to $678.7 billion. This bodes well for both Alphabet and Meta Platforms.However, macroeconomic challenges, including tariffs and increasing regulatory headwinds, are a concern for both.

Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on integrating AI into its platforms — Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Threads — is driving user engagement to boost ad revenues. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement.These factors are expected to drive Meta Platforms’ top-line growth.

The news comes after Trump earlier posted on Truth Social that the U.S. is aware of the location of Iran supreme leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei but had opted not to take any action, then saying “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,” the report notes. The White House has previously said it won’t join Israel’s attacks, the report says..TIKTOK BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump intends to sign an executive order sparing TikTok from a law banning or forcing a sale of the social media platform, again delaying a deadline for enforcement of said law, the Wall Street Journal’s Alex Leary reports. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Publicly traded companies in the space include Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Reddit (RDDT) and Snap (SNAP)..STABLECOIN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to set up the first regulatory framework for stablecoins, Axios’ Stephen Neukam reports. The GENIUS Act, which has been criticized by many Democrats over corruption concerns surrounding President Trump’s growing cryptocurrency empire, was passed with a 68-30 vote, with two GOP members voting no on the legislation, the author says.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, has voiced support for psychedelics as a potential mental health treatment and Calley Means, a White House adviser, wrote that psychedelics “should be an important public policy priority for the United States”. Additionally, Casey Means, the president’s surgeon general pick, described psilocybin therapy as “one of the most meaningful experiences of life” and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has made positive remarks on the opportunity the substances could hold for veterans. Publicly traded companies in the space include Atai Life Sciences (ATAI), Clearmind (CMND), Compass Pathways (CMPS), Cybin (CYBN), GH research (GHRS) and Mind Medicine (MNMD).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-trade-president-said-weigh-141055103.html," The risk analysis of President Trump considering a U.S. strike against Iran involves several key points:  1. **Geopolitical Tension**: The potential for increased regional instability due to U.S.-Iran relations could escalate tensions with neighboring countries like Syria and Iraq, leading to violence and displaced populations.  2. **Regional Escalation**: This action might heighten conflicts in the Middle East, affecting stability and causing further disruptions in energy markets and economic growth.  3. **Unintended Consequences**: The strike may send a strong signal to adversary nations, increasing tensions with Russia and China, who have significant influence over Iran. This could impact global energy markets (e.g., oil prices) and U.S.-China relations.  4. **Uncertainty in Implementation**: The administration's ability to execute such actions without political or logistical challenges remains uncertain, potentially leading to miscommunication or miscalculations with unforeseen effects.  5. **International Law and Security Council Resolutions**: Departing from existing resolutions could affect the legitimacy of U.S. actions and impact international forums' perception of U.S. foreign policy.  6. **Economic Impact**: The strike might disrupt oil production, affecting global energy markets and economic growth, while also potentially softening sanctions already in place.  7. **Cognitive Risks**: Overstepping or losing face by taking harsher measures could affect the administration's standing internationally.  In conclusion, the primary risks are geopolitical tensions, regional instability, unintended diplomatic and economic consequences, and implementation uncertainty."

2025-06-19 21:00:00,Mark Zuckerberg Is ‘Doubling Down’ on AI and That’s Great News for META Stock,Meta’s aggressive AI push is winning over Wall Street and putting shares firmly back in the tech spotlight.,"One of the most notable investment themes in recent memory is, of course, an increasing focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is not above this trend among companies. In fact, Meta Platforms is doubling down. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone all-in on AI, and Wall Street is clearly taking notice. META stock has jumped a notable 45% from its April low of $479.80 per share as investors rally behind the firm’s growing commitment to AI innovation..The latest jolt of momentum comes from Meta’s massive $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, a leading data-labeling startup whose CEO is now joining Meta’s artificial general intelligence (AGI) team. This move comes right after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast to as much as $72 billion. That figure underlines just how serious Zuckerberg is about leading the AI race..‘It Has No Utility’: Warren Buffett Doesn’t Care How High Gold Goes, He Isn’t a Buyer.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Says ‘We Are Heading Towards a World Where AI Will Just Have Unbelievable Context on Your Life’.Archer Aviation Is Betting Big on Its Fledgling Defense Business.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else..Despite such heavy spending, the market response has remained positive. With several analysts across the Street hiking their price targets for META stock and optimism running high, this AI-fueled rally is hard to ignore. All signs point to Meta remaining a major player in the next tech era — and that makes shares worth a much closer look..Meta Platforms has evolved far beyond its Facebook roots. As the powerhouse behind Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, it still shapes how the world connects. But now the firm is setting its sights on the future of AI. Aside from its latest $14.3 billion bet on Scale AI, Meta has been steadily integrating AI into its core platforms since last year..In April 2025, the company launched Meta AI, a chatbot assistant that has already reached 1 billion monthly active users across its apps. Meta is also gaining traction in hardware, with AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses seeing user growth surge. Finally, the company is working on harnessing AI to supercharge ad targeting and boost user engagement across its entire app family, including Instagram and WhatsApp. META stock drew fresh attention on June 16, climbing 2.8% after the company announced plans to roll out ads within its WhatsApp messaging platform, unlocking a powerful new revenue stream from the app’s massive global user base.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-doubling-down-ai-130002750.html," The analysis of the news regarding Meta doubling down on AI reveals both positive and negative aspects associated with AI development:  1. **Positive Impact**: The increase in Meta's stock is a reflection of investor sentiment and could indicate short-term gains due to higher interest.  2. **Underlying Risks**: Despite the positive framing, AI development inherently carries risks such as potential job displacement, privacy concerns, ethical issues, cybersecurity threats, and misuse. These risks are not directly addressed by the news but are inherent to any significant investment in AI.  3. **Investor Sentiment vs. Company Actions**: The action of doubling down on AI does not eliminate these risks; it is more about investor reactions and future expectations.  4. **Short-term vs. Long-term Considerations**: While positive for the short term, long-term risks like increased competition, regulatory scrutiny, or technological evolution could affect Meta's performance.  In conclusion, while the news presents a positive framing for Meta's stock, it does not eliminate the associated risks inherent in AI development. Therefore, this is not risk-free and requires careful management of potential long-term challenges."
2025-06-19 20:32:00,2 Dividend Stocks Growth-Oriented Investors Will Love,Meta Platforms and Booking Holdings started paying dividends last year.  Both are top players in their industries and have tremendous growth prospects.  Two examples in that department are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG).,"Meta Platforms and Booking Holdings started paying dividends last year..Both are top players in their industries and have tremendous growth prospects..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Growth and income investing may be two distinct styles, but it's possible to combine them by selecting the right stocks. Some corporations have excellent growth prospects and also offer dividend programs that seem at least somewhat reliable..Two examples in that department are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG). Although they are new dividend payers, these market leaders' strong underlying businesses mean they should reward shareholders with consistent dividends for a long time while also capitalizing on significant growth opportunities..Let me explain..Meta Platforms is the leading social media company. It boasts 3.43 billion daily active users across its websites and apps -- that's pretty close to half of the 8 billion people on Earth, a total that includes many who are too young to be on any of the company's platforms. Meta's deep ecosystem makes it an excellent target for advertisers. That's how it generates most of its sales, and that business is still booming..In the first quarter, Meta Platforms' revenue increased by 16% year over year to $42.3 billion. The tech leader's earnings per share (EPS) came in at $6.43, 37% higher than the year-ago period..Here's the good news for investors: Meta Platforms' business is getting even better thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). The company has used AI-powered algorithms to increase engagement on its apps. That means more time spent on Facebook and Instagram, which naturally leads to greater demand for ads and higher revenue. Meta Platforms is also utilizing AI to enhance the ad launch process. Management aims to fully automate this system by the end of 2026..These initiatives could have a significantly positive impact on Meta Platforms' performance in the long run. That's why the company is doubling down with massive investments in AI infrastructure, to the tune of $65 billion this year, according to some reports..The company also has other growth opportunities, including business messaging on WhatsApp. Although economic and trade concerns could continue to impact the stock -- Meta lost some ad revenue from Asia-based retailers in the first quarter -- the company should still deliver strong results thanks to the lucrative opportunities at its disposal..Lastly, Meta Platforms initiated a quarterly dividend last year. The company offers a quarterly dividend of approximately $0.52 per share. Meta's payouts look safe, and although it doesn't have a substantial dividend history yet, investors can benefit from the growth and income it will provide in the next five years and beyond.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-dividend-stocks-growth-oriented-123200320.html," The analysis of the risk associated with Meta Platforms (META) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) paying dividends involves several considerations:  1. **Market Risk**: The stock market's volatility can impact the value of investments in these companies, affecting dividend yields even if their growth prospects remain strong.  2. **Geopolitical Risks**: Factors such as geopolitical tensions or regulatory changes could affect these companies' operations, potentially reducing their growth and thus dividends.  3. **Economic Uncertainty**: A global economic downturn might reduce consumer spending on travel or virtual experiences, impacting Booking Holdings more directly, while meta could face challenges if the metaverse adoption isn't as expected.  4. **Liquidity Risk**: Low trading volume in either company's stock could make it difficult for investors to buy or sell shares timely, affecting dividend receipt.  5. **Tax Implications**: Varying tax rates based on the companies' locations and customers' countries can influence net returns from dividends.  6. **Concentration Risk**: Investing in two large-cap stocks may not provide significant diversification benefits if both perform poorly simultaneously.  In summary, while these companies offer growth potential with dividend payments, investors should be mindful of market volatility, geopolitical factors, economic conditions, liquidity issues, tax impacts, and concentration risk when considering their impact on investment performance."

He suggested Meta sees OpenAI as its main rival in artificial intelligence..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META..Altman criticized the strategy of handing out massive guaranteed compensation, saying it may hurt innovation and distract from actual progress. You're always going to where your competitor was, he said, adding that culture, not just cash, drives breakthroughs..The hiring push comes amid Meta's broader investment in AI. Last week, the company acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion, bringing founder Alexandr Wang and several team members into the fold. Wang is expected to lead a lab focused on ""superintelligence,"" or AI that surpasses human capability..Meta has also brought in researchers from Google's DeepMind, including Jack Rae, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to take a hands-on role in expanding the company's AI capabilities..Despite delays in rolling out its latest AI model, analysts note that Meta remains a central player in the open-source AI space, thanks to its Llama models.

Altman says Mark Zuckerberg himself is calling staff directly, trying to build a superintelligence dream team to reboot Meta's AI momentum. Despite these high-stakes pitches, Altman insists none of his best people have taken the bait, suggesting Meta's compensation-first approach isn't resonating with those focused on mission and impact..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META..It's not hard to see why Meta is pressing the gas. After a year of AI setbacksdelays to its flagship Behemoth model, backlash over Llama 4's performance claims, and a quiet exodus of senior AI researchers including Joelle Pineauthe company is scrambling to regain its footing. Zuckerberg recently poured $15 billion into Scale AI and hired its co-founder Alexandr Wang, signaling Meta's urgency to close the gap with rivals. But critics point to a deeper issue: even with aggressive spending, Meta's leadership in AI remains in question..Altman called out Meta's strategy bluntly: a ton of upfront guaranteed comp doesn't build long-term innovation. While Meta's compensation packages can reach $3.7 million, OpenAI's own ranges are no small change, with some engineers earning over $1.3 million. Still, the contrast in culture and direction seems to matter more than the money. As Meta races to catch up, investors may want to watch whether the dollars actually translate into breakthroughsor just headlines..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-throwing-100m-openai-engineers-105624309.html," The analysis of Meta's investment in OpenAI highlights several key risks:  1. **Financial Risk**: The $100M expenditure carries uncertainty regarding potential cost overruns or outcomes, impacting Meta's financial health.  2. **Operational Risk**: Resistance from OpenAI could divert resources and affect Meta's efficiency in managing its AI hiring strategies.  3. **Reputational Risk**: Public scrutiny of Meta's leadership might erode investor confidence if seen as unprotecting their interests.  4. **Competitive Risk**: The move may either bolster Meta or leave them vulnerable to stronger competition from OpenAI, particularly with their GPT-4 model.  5. **Strategic Risk**: Meta might underestimate the challenges posed by resistance and failure to deliver on collaboration, affecting long-term strategic plans.  These risks collectively underscore the need for careful consideration of potential outcomes in this strategic transaction."

The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: Novo Nordisk Backs Away From Hims & Hers Partnership and Fiserv Connecting Thousands of Banks to Crypto with New Stablecoin Platform.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders.

But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

Any failure to innovate successfully or lose key clients could negatively impact revenue and growth.  3. **Market Competition**: The competitive nature of the tech industry means increased competition from other players might exert downward pressure on market share and profits for Broadcom.  4. **Product/Market Dependence**: Heavy reliance on specific product lines or sectors, such as semiconductors across various industries, could be vulnerable to disruptions in those areas.  5. **Regulatory Changes**: Adapting to regulatory shifts, especially in emerging areas like data privacy and semiconductor production, is essential to avoid potential challenges.  6. **Economic Downturns**: The broader economic environment affects consumer spending on technology products; a weak economy might reduce demand, impacting the company's performance.  In summary, while Broadcom demonstrates significant growth potential, these risks highlight the need for careful consideration of its financial stability and operational sustainability."

These three each tackle AI in their own way and could be excellent long-term investments..Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed to train and run AI workloads. Its market share dominance in this industry is impressive, with most estimates pegging it at around 90%. Due to unprecedented AI demand, the GPU market has grown massively, and Nvidia's growth has been nothing short of jaw-dropping..Nvidia put up impressive growth figures over the past few years, and although the growth rate is ""slowing,"" it's hard to say that seriously when Nvidia grew revenue 69% year over year to $44 billion in Q1. It also projects it to grow by 50% in Q2, underscoring its strength..As long as there's huge AI demand, Nvidia will be a successful investment. Even with shares trading at 33 times forward earnings, it's about in line with other big tech stocks. However, Nvidia's growth and potential are far greater than many of its big tech peers, which makes it a solid stock to scoop up in June..Taiwan Semiconductor is a huge beneficiary of the massive demand that Nvidia experienced. Nvidia doesn't have the ability to produce its own chips, so it outsources that work to Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia isn't the only company that does this; nearly every big tech company that makes hardware uses chips from Taiwan Semiconductor's factories. This allows Taiwan Semi to stay neutral in the AI arms race, while benefiting from the massive spending..Investing in TSMC isn't picking a winner in the AI arms race; it's a bet that there will be increased AI spending in the future. That seems like a surefire take, so the stock will stay at the top of my buy list for the foreseeable future..Another reason I'm a Taiwan Semi bull is its stock price. Despite benefiting from multiple tailwinds, its stock hasn't achieved a premium valuation. It trades at 22.9 times forward earnings -- the same as the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-091500328.html," The news article discusses the potential for AI-related companies to see increased investment interest in June 2023.

But as the first half of the year winds down, the mergers and acquisitions market looks not as bad as investors feared..Bankers can thank AI for that..Corporations and private equity firms aren't letting up on their push to capture the artificial intelligence wave, and it's not expected to slow down..""Anything that's sheltered from tariffs in a shifting and evolving sector is where you're going to see the activity right now, and AI is somewhere with that, where there is an absolute race,"" Lucinda Guthrie, head of data provider Mergermarket, told Yahoo Finance..Between the beginning of January and June 17, the number of US-targeted mergers and acquisitions is down by roughly 18%, according to Dealogic. But the total value of all of this year's deals is up 10% compared to the same period in 2024..Much of that added volume is coming from AI-related deals where ""the traditional tech giants all now need to do something,"" Guthrie said, adding that ""although not necessarily clear-cut,"" these same firms have been anticipating a smoother approval process from antitrust regulators..From Meta's (META) $14 billion acquisition of Scale AI last week to the $8 billion purchase agreement Salesforce (CRM) struck with AI-powered data platform Informatica (INFA) in late May, some of the biggest recent deals have been AI-focused. But that was the case even before the Trump administration rolled out sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs on April 2..In fact, seven of the 15 largest US M&A deals so far this year have been about positioning for AI, according to Dealogic data..The two biggest came in March with Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) all-cash acquisition of New York-based cloud security platform Wiz for $32 billion and Japanese firm SoftBank's (9984.T) agreement to lead a $40 billion fundraiser of ChatGPT maker OpenAI..It hasn’t just been software companies either, according to a first-half deals report from PwC. Companies in industrials, utilities, and even private equity are doing AI deals..""Whether it's the advent of AI and the whole ecosystem behind AI, not just the technology and the language models, but the data centers, the energy, getting the energy to the data centers, all the [telecommunications] that goes around that, there's a tremendous amount of change,"" PwC US deals platform leader Kevin Desai said in a Friday press briefing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dealmaking-in-2025-ai-to-the-rescue-090041282.html," The article discusses how AI is helping to mitigate concerns about reduced mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in 2025, making the market better than feared despite initial fears of lower activity.   **Analysis:**  1. **Understanding the Context:** The article highlights that Wall Street's hopes for a banner year were dampened by a dry-up in M&A activity. However, AI has made this market not as bad as initially feared.  2. **Identifying the News Type:** This news pertains to financial markets, specifically mergers and acquisitions.  3. **Assessing Potential Risks:**    - The article does not explicitly mention negative risks associated with AI's role in M&A.    - It focuses on how AI has helped reduce the perceived risk of lower-than-expected M&A activity.    - The positive aspect is that AI has improved market activity beyond expectations, thereby reducing concerns about a dry-up.  4. **Conclusion:** While the article addresses fears of reduced M&A activity by highlighting AI's role, there isn't a specific negative risk introduced. Instead, it mitigates the expected risk through AI application.  **Final Answer:**  There is no specific risk mentioned in the article; instead, it highlights how AI has helped reduce concerns about lower-than-expected M&A activity."

Some focus on valuation. Others prioritize growth potential. A few look for arbitrage opportunities..But there's at least one common denominator among many ultrarich investors these days: They like artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Billionaires are buying these three AI stocks hand over fist..Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stands out as a top pick for several billionaire investors. Izzy Englander might be the most bullish about the tech stock. His Millennium Management hedge fund upped its position in Alphabet by 150.8% in the first quarter of 2025..Ken Griffin is another billionaire hedge fund manager who's enthusiastic about Alphabet stock. His Citadel Advisors increased its stake in the tech giant by 55.7% in Q1. Appaloosa's David Tepper also bought over 128,000 additional shares of Alphabet, bumping up his holding in the stock by 6.8%..What do these billionaire investors like about Alphabet? Its valuation is probably near the top of the list. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 19. None of the other so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks comes anywhere close to such an attractive valuation..Alphabet has also been showing that it's playing to win in the AI space. The company's Google Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks No. 1 overall on the LMArena leaderboard. Google Cloud continues to be the fastest-growing of the top three cloud service providers..There isn't as much of a consensus among billionaire investors when it comes to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management upped its stake in the e-commerce and cloud service giant by 2.7% in Q1 and Englander's Millennium Management boosted its position in Amazon by 5.3%. However, Griffin's Citadel Advisors reduced its Amazon holding by 43.5%. Tepper's Appaloosa trimmed its position in Amazon by 3.5%..But one billionaire loaded up on Amazon stock in the first quarter. George Soros bought more than 101,000 shares, increasing his hedge fund's stake in Amazon by 30.5%.

However, it doesn't explicitly outline specific risks but implies systemic risks inherent to such investments:  1. **Market Volatility**: The sudden influx of capital could cause stock price fluctuations. 2. **Economic Impact**: Market bubbles might burst, affecting the tech sector and related industries, potentially slowing innovation and employment. 3. **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in regulations on AI technologies could impact these companies negatively. 4. **Sector Concentration**: Over-reliance on AI investments might lead to vulnerabilities if growth stalls or face challenges.  These risks are broader economic implications rather than individual investment risks."

Digital media has transformed advertising. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are the biggest winners in the industry, but there are others benefiting as well, including ad tech companies taking advantage of continued growth in areas such as connected TV, retail media, better ad targeting, and improvements enabled by AI..Keep reading for more details on two of these ad tech stocks that can make investors a fortune..There's no getting around it: Roku's (NASDAQ: ROKU) performance disappointed investors in recent years. Roku's stock price remains down more than 80% from its peak in 2021. That's when the pandemic-driven boom quickly faded as the economy reopened and the streaming industry's surging growth hit a wall..Roku was forced to do several rounds of layoffs, having overspent during the pandemic. But the business and the streaming industry more broadly underwent a reset and are prepared for growth. Netflix's stock soared to an all-time high recently as its ad tier has taken off. Walt Disney is now making a profit in its streaming division, and the stock recently hit a 52-week high, while Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, one focused on studios and the other on streaming..Streaming services appear to be moving past their post-pandemic struggles, and Roku should benefit. Despite the stock's woes, the business continues to deliver solid growth, with revenue up 16% year over year in the first quarter to $1.02 billion, and its bottom line is improving as well. The company also expects to report an operating profit using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) metrics..There are also other signs of building momentum. The stock price jumped on Monday after the company announced an exclusive integration with Amazon's demand side platform, and it's also gaining share of listings on retail sites such as Amazon and Target, a sign that it's probably gaining market share as well..As the leading streaming distribution platform, Roku is well-positioned to capitalize on continued growth in connected TV, and at a market cap of $11 billion, the stock could easily double, triple, or better from here, especially if it hits its profit goal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ad-tech-stocks-could-080000461.html," The news about Roku, The Trade Desk, and the AI sector involves several key risks:  1. **Roku's Deal Risks**: Roku's partnership with Amazon could be positive, but it carries the risk of unforeseen challenges such as regulatory issues or a slower-than-expected progression toward profitability.  2. **The Trade Desk's Valuation Risks**: Despite solid growth, trading at a discount suggests that investors may not fully recognize the company's potential, indicating market perception risks.  3. **AI Sector Risks**: The rapid pace of technological changes and competition in AI could render existing investments obsolete or difficult to compete against with new innovations.  Overall, these factors present various risks that could impact investment decisions related to Roku, The Trade Desk, and companies within the AI sector."

(NASDAQ:META) from $690 to $765, maintaining a buy rating. The analyst cited macroeconomic uncertainties that have eased and the growing optimism surrounding the company’s ability to monetize its platform with AI-assisted marketing and innovative ad strategies. This comes amid META’s growing strategic focus on strengthening its AI capabilities to help marketers..On Thursday, June 12, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) finalized an agreement with ScaleAI to acquire a 49% non-controlling stake in it for $14.8 billion.

The deal is META’s second-largest, under which Scale AI’s 28-year-old Alexandr Wang has been brought onboard and will remain on Scale AI’s board..In response to the deal, Google, the biggest client of Scale AI, severed its ties with the company. Meanwhile, there are concerns regarding the deal’s impact on market competition. While META’s non-controlling stake doesn’t require review by U.S. antitrust regulators, it could lead to an investigation if the regulators believe the deal was structured with the intent to harm competition..U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren commented on the deal:.“Meta can call this deal whatever it wants – but if it violates federal law because it unlawfully squashes competition or makes it easier for Meta to illegally dominate, antitrust enforcers should investigate and block it.”.Meta Platforms, Inc.

Unlike standard logins, passkeys use Face ID or Touch ID, a PIN, or a physical security authentication key to validate logins..Passkeys remove the need to rely on username and password combinations, which can be susceptible to phishing and other issues..Facebook says that passkeys will also start rolling out to Messenger in the coming months, and that users will be able to use the same passkey for both services..Passkeys can also be used to autofill payment information when making purchases using Meta Pay, Facebook says..To set up a passkey, you’ll navigate to the new “passkey” option in Accounts Center within the Settings menu on Facebook. Once it’s set up, you can start using your passkey to log in to Facebook on your phone. You’ll still be able to use other authentication methods, such as your password, to access your account so that you can still access the social network when using a device that doesn’t support passkeys..Facebook is one of many tech companies to introduce passkey support in the past year or so. Other big names that have done so include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, PayPal, TikTok, WhatsApp, X, and GitHub.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-soon-roll-support-passkeys-171957499.html," The addition of passkey support for logins on Facebook is classified as **Low Risk**.   This assessment is based on the fact that passkeys add an additional layer of security by requiring physical access, complementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) practices already in place or planned across Facebook's user base. While there might be a slight concern about user inconvenience, especially for those without smartphones, the risk of increased unauthorized access is mitigated due to the enhanced security measures.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .More reassurance for Meta advertisers, with Meta today announcing that it’s been re-accredited by the Media Ratings Council (MRC) for Content-Level Brand Safety, meaning that Meta’s documented processes continue to meet the MRC standards for brand safety and measurement.  .The MRC conducts audits of ad systems to ensure measurement processes meet quality and assurance benchmarks, providing third-party checking to give ad partners more confidence in such..As per the MRC:.“Accreditation indicates that the Measurement Statistics reported for the Service comply with: (1) the Minimum Standards for Media Rating Research, the Enhanced Content Level Context and Brand Safety Guidelines and the Business Partner Qualification requirements of the Invalid Traffic Detection and Filtration Standards Addendum (version 2.0) published by the MRC; the Ad Verification Guidelines published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB); (2) the procedures described in Meta’s answers to the MRC questionnaire; and (3) the procedures described in procedure manuals and textual materials included in reports of the Service..So it’s based on Meta’s documentation, not its actual process, which is a relevant note, while there are also a lot of exclusions noted in the official document. But even so, it provides some level of additional checking, ensuring that Meta's meeting industry standards, as defined by the MRC..Though there was one particularly interesting note in this latest review:.“Misinformation is excluded from accreditation and remains in process of review as Community Notes applied to this category are being assessed.”.So the MRC isn't willing to provide assurance on the prevalence of misinformation on Facebook, Instagram and Threads at this stage, due to Meta’s change in approach in enforcing such, as it moves to allow more speech in its apps..Depending on your perspective, that could be a valid note..In addition to MRC re-accreditation, Facebook and Instagram have also recently received brand safety re-certification from the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) for the sixth consecutive year, while Integral Ad Science has also launched a new contextual category reporting for Meta Platforms, which further expands its measurement reporting across Facebook and Instagram..As per IAS:.“Total Media Quality (TMQ) for Meta, contextual category reporting provides advertisers with the most accurate and actionable brand safety and suitability measurement. TMQ is powered by IAS’s multimedia technology, providing unmatched insight into video content through frame-by-frame analysis of video images, audio, and text to provide the most accurate measurement at scale.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-gains-ad-safety-certifications-170848276.html," The news about Meta obtaining new ad safety certifications for Facebook and Instagram is positive, enhancing user trust and convenience without indicating any immediate risks. The analysis concludes that there are no significant direct risks associated with this development.  **Answer:** No risk."
2025-06-19 01:01:00,Top Analyst Predicts Big Upside For Meta --WhatsApp Ads Could Fuel Billions,Meta's WhatsApp Ads Could Be a Goldmine: Price Target Raised to $807,"June 18 - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) received a price target hike from Cantor Fitzgerald's Deepak Mathivanan, who raised his estimate to $807 from $676, citing optimism over WhatsApp's new ad features. The new target suggests a potential upside of about 14% from current levels..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META..Mathivanan maintained an Overweight rating, noting that Meta's strategy to introduce ads in the WhatsApp Updates tab, while keeping private chats untouched, could unlock a new revenue stream. He pointed to emerging features like Status Ads and Promoted Channels that offer exposure without disrupting the user experience..The analyst highlighted WhatsApp's vast reach of over 3 billion monthly users, with around 1.5 billion daily visits to the Updates tab. Strong engagement metrics, including an 82% daily active user rate and high story view counts, suggest room for ad-driven growth, particularly outside Western markets..Even if ad penetration on WhatsApp reaches just 5% of the level seen on Facebook and Instagram, Mathivanan believes it could have a material impact on earnings by fiscal 2027..Shares of Meta were little changed in recent trading..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-analyst-predicts-big-upside-170138363.html," The news about Meta's WhatsApp ads potentially fueling billions of dollars in value presents a high upside scenario but also carries several risks:  1. **Market Risk**: Although the market may support growth, it's subject to broader market fluctuations which could impact performance.  2. **Regulatory Risk**: Potential changes in regulations affecting data privacy and ad models could pose challenges for WhatsApp's business model.  3. **Competitive Risk**: The rise of competitors like Instagram Business, Facebook's ad offerings, and Google's services could affect WhatsApp's revenue streams.  4. **Operational Risk**: Success depends on executing ad business effectively without high costs or integration issues, along with successful user adoption.  5. **Strategic Risk**: Expansion into new markets (hardware, verticals) may not yield the expected success.  6. **Macroeconomic Factors**: Economic conditions could influence ad spending and ad campaign effectiveness.  Given these considerations, while the news indicates significant potential, investors should be aware of these risks to fully assess the situation."

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Facebook’s adding an extra level of log-in security, by enabling users to log in via Passkeys, which will provide another way to access your account without relying on passwords, or other less secure means..Passkeys, which enable fingerprint and face ID login, utilize cryptographic data transfer to facilitate access, with your actual login info remaining on your device. That makes it a more secure login option, and many cybersecurity experts are now recommending that social platforms support Passkey access..Which Facebook is now moving to align with..As explained by Meta:.“Passkeys will soon be available on iOS and Android mobile devices for Facebook, and we will begin rolling out passkeys to Messenger in the coming months. The same passkey you set up for Facebook will also work on Messenger once this capability launches.”.Meta says that users will also be able to use Passkeys to securely autofill payment information when making purchases using Meta Pay, while it’ll also be enabled to protect your encrypted message backups..It’s a good update, providing more security options for your Facebook info..Several other platforms have already enabled Passkey access, with X adding it early last year, along with TikTok and LinkedIn. And given the ongoing concerns around account hacking, it makes sense that, eventually, all platforms are likely to implement the option as another security measure..So really, Meta’s catching up on this front, but again, it will provide another potentially valuable option to help secure your Facebook info, including payment details, which could provide more assurance for users..Meta says that, once the option is available to you, you’ll be able to set up and manage your passkey in the “Accounts Center” via your profile settings..“Once it’s set up, you’ll be able to use your passkey moving forward to log in to Facebook on your mobile device. You’ll still be able to use other authentication methods, such as your password, to access your account. That way you can still access your Facebook account when you’re using a device that doesn’t support passkeys yet.”.A handy update, which, as noted, moves Facebook into line with broader security shifts.   .Recommended Reading .Meta Adds Video Calling Updates, Including HD Video Calls",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-enables-passkey-access-providing-164136873.html," The introduction of passkey access by Facebook introduces a potential risk in that it adds an additional layer of authentication, which can inadvertently increase vulnerability if both systems (biometric and password-based) are compromised independently. This dual-layer approach could allow unauthorized access through either method, posing a risk to account security unless the implementation is robust and user adoption is maintained effectively.  **Risk Classification:** Medium Risk"

The ChatGPT maker was already in the process of winding down its reliance on Scale before Meta, an OpenAI competitor, took a 49% stake in the firm, the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data needed to support increasingly advanced artificial intelligence models..OpenAI’s plans inject new uncertainty into Scale’s business in the wake of Meta’s unusual deal. Meta is investing $14.3 billion in Scale and has poached the startup’s chief executive officer, Alexandr Wang, for a new so-called “superintelligence” unit, focused on building a more powerful, and hypothetical, form of AI software. Other Scale employees are expected to follow Wang to Meta to work on AI..A Scale AI spokesperson declined to comment..Founded in 2016, Scale signed up prominent customers, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta and OpenAI, providing them with the data needed to build AI models. However, Meta’s deal with Scale raised concerns that the social-media company may gain new visibility into its rivals’ AI development efforts. Google plans to cut ties with Scale, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.Right after the Meta deal was announced, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar had signaled that the company intended to keep working with Scale. “We don’t want to ice the ecosystem because acquisitions are going to happen,” Friar said at the VivaTech conference in Paris last week.Over the past six to 12 months, however, OpenAI had determined that Scale was not the best fit for it because the AI developer needed more data expertise than Scale could provide, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI has shifted to building more advanced AI models that can mimic the process of human reasoning, as well as agent-like models that can carry out tasks with limited input from users. Forbes previously reported OpenAI had been winding down its Scale work for months.Scale initially focused on working with an army of contractors to do the grunt work of labeling text and images for earlier AI systems. Scale has gradually enlisted better-paid contractors with doctorates, nursing and other advanced degrees to help develop more sophisticated models.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-phasing-scale-ai-following-150114302.html," The news about OpenAI phasing out its partnership with Scale AI presents several considerations regarding risk:  1. **Operational Risk**: There is a potential operational risk if OpenAI loses a key strategic partner. The partnership involved data labeling, which could affect their AI development projects or resource allocation.  2. **Financial Impact**: Since Scale AI accounted for only a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, the financial impact might be minimal. This reduces the immediate risk associated with phasing out the partnership.  3. **Strategic Risk**: There is a strategic consideration in shifting focus away from data labeling to other areas. If this leads to neglecting important projects or features, it could affect user trust and satisfaction.  4. **Market Dynamics**: The decision might set a precedent for other major AI players, potentially affecting competition but likely more about positioning than direct market risk.  Overall, the primary risks are operational and strategic in nature, with minimal financial impact due to the partnership's limited contribution to OpenAI's revenue. Therefore, the risk level is moderate but not significant given the current context."

The funding will accelerate Tensec's mission to provide global trading companies and their clients access to cross-border real-time payments and transaction banking services that have historically been available only through large financial institutions..Led by Costanoa Ventures, the round also includes investments from Quiet Capital, WillowTree Investments, Cambrian VC, Ignia Partners, Montage Ventures, Renegade Partners, and Endeavor Scale Up Ventures..""SMBs drive nearly half of global trade but have long been excluded from the financial tools that larger players rely on,"" said Helcio Nobre, CEO and co-founder of Tensec. ""We're flipping the model by empowering global trading companies to deliver these services directly to their partners—making global commerce faster, cheaper and more accessible."".Tensec leverages AI, real-time payments and a global fintech infrastructure to create a no-integration platform that enables global trading companies to offer foreign exchange (FX) services, cross-border payments, treasury and other financial services to their SMB clients. The company is already working with customers who facilitate $10 billion in annual trade volume. Tensec projects this will grow to $30 billion in annual trade volume after its upcoming service expansion into APAC and the EU markets..""Tensec lets global trade companies seamlessly integrate financial services to better serve their clients,"" said Amy Cheetham, Partner at Costanoa Ventures. ""It's a win-win—new revenue for trading companies and modern financial tools for SMBs who've been underserved for decades."".Tensec is targeting the massive cross-border payments infrastructure that still runs on 40-year-old SWIFT technology. With global cross-border payments projected to reach $250 trillion by 2030, there has been significant fintech innovation in consumer and enterprise payments. However, SMB cross-border payments remain largely untouched by innovation, despite representing over 40% of the $25 trillion annual physical goods trade. Tensec is bridging this critical gap.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tensec-secures-12m-transform-190t-143400075.html," The news about Tensec securing $12 million in seed funding to expand into the $190 trillion cross-border payments market presents several risks:  1. **Market Competition**: The potential to compete with established fintech companies like PayPal or Venmo is significant, as they already offer similar services.  2. **Funding Dependency**: Relying solely on a single funding round carries the risk of insufficient future funding if this round does not materialize.  3. **Differentiation Challenge**: There may be little to no clear market gap that Tensec can exploit to differentiate itself in such a saturated and competitive sector.  4. **Innovation Race**: The emergence of new innovative solutions from competitors post-funding could erode market share, as the industry evolves rapidly.  5. **Regulatory Risks**: Changes or stricter regulations in cross-border payments could impact their operations and profitability.  6. **Infrastructure Gaps**: Potential delays in building a robust infrastructure required for seamless global payments could be risky if scaled up too quickly.  7. **Market Adoption**: Client adoption may face challenges, especially if existing systems are well-established and clients are hesitant to adopt new solutions.  In conclusion, while Tensec's entry into such a large market is promising, the risks stem from competition, funding dependency, differentiation, innovation, regulatory changes, infrastructure needs, and potential challenges in market adoption."

Some employees from Scale AI will join Meta as part of the deal..Over the past few years, Zuckerberg has pushed increasingly further into repositioning Meta into an AI powerhouse with mixed success.

These risks collectively suggest that while Meta's move could have strategic advantages, it also carries significant challenges in terms of market impact, financial health, reputation, strategy alignment, regulatory compliance, and employee well-being."

We are watching meta social media stocks and names in the crypto space. Yahoo Finance's Josh Shafer here to help me break them down a little bit more and do a deep dive on some of them. First up here, we got to set the stage and talk about OpenAI Sam Altman saying that meta is offering $100 million bonuses to open AI staff in attempt to build up meta's talent pool. The Facebook parent company getting more aggressive in attempts to improve its own artificial intelligence offerings. Meta reportedly delaying the rollout of its latest AI model because of concerns around quality. And CNBC also reporting that Zuckerberg is frustrated with meta's standing in big tech's AI race. This comes as meta announcing it will pay $14 billion for 49% stake in scale AI as well. .A hundred million dollar bonuses? I feel like we got to just press pause on that for a second. That's a pretty significant bonus. .That's crazy. .It makes you want to go on Udemy and start to take some quick coding classes or whatever you need necessary to qualify. .You and I are big sports fans and even someone like Patrick Mahomes, I don't think he's barely getting $100 million signing bonus, right? It's pretty shocking, but I think it gives you an idea obviously what you were just hinting at of where meta feels like they're at here and maybe needing to do a little bit more. Interesting to me because meta is one of the few companies on earnings calls that has been able to show how AI is helping their business, right? When you think about something like what they're doing with reels, how AI is playing a role in that, but this seems to be going for people from OpenAI. It seems to be more of that large language model play and doing something a little bit different and more targeted closer to what OpenAI is doing, not necessarily just using AI and sort of the AI use case space, but meta trying to be an industry leader in that large language model part of the AI story. .Yeah, seemed like he made this acknowledgement on the Uncapped podcast, which is hosted by his brother, we should note. Also here, it's interesting, this has been quite the week for OpenAI and getting some of their own major agreements here, of course, talking through some of the most recent developments here. They've got their first partnership with OpenAI and the government initiative, a pilot program with the US Department of Defense. It's a massive move forward for them and the chief digital and artificial intelligence office contract is worth about $200 million and the ceiling price for it. And essentially this is going to allow the Defense Department to identify and prototype frontier AI and how that can transform its own administrative operations. And so we'll see exactly what that looks like in practice, but this is a major step forward for OpenAI and acknowledgement of the power that they do have behind their engine. .I'm taking a look at our private market data that we have now on Yahoo Finance. OpenAI's estimated valuation per our data, $324 billion. .Yes. .If that company ever comes public, it might be the biggest IPO ever, Brad. .It could potentially be in the throws of it. Yes, for sure. I'm old enough to remember when Saudi Aramco went public though. That was a pretty large one too. Next up, we're checking out shares of social media stocks as President Trump set to delay Tik Tok's divest or ban deadline by another 90 days. The White House confirming that the president will sign an executive order this week extending the deadline, granting the administration more time to close a deal and keep Tik Tok working in the US. This would mark the president's third extension of the ban which requires Tik Tok's Chinese parent company sell off the US version of the app. There you're taking a look at some of the social media stocks on the move here pre-market. And of course it is one big pull for some of the advertising dollars that would go to Tik Tok versus a meta versus Snap versus Pinterest and how they all battle for those dollars. And ultimately, for Tik Tok, they've been able to quickly grow out their user base, make sure that they're also wooing some of those advertising dollars and how they're doing so is also making for a very competitive threat to these companies. .It's starting to feel like this ban just isn't going to happen, right? Because when things continuously get pushed back, continuously get pushed back, I just start to lose a little bit of confidence. .Such a pawn as part of the geopolitical discussions now. .Right, exactly, right? And that's why it keeps coming up. I think when we're talking about the social media stocks, I mean, the most interesting one to me is Snap, right? Just thinking about how Snap has performed as a stock over the last couple of years, I mean, it's down 25% year to date, down almost 50% over the last year. Snap needs some help, right? To bring in more users and drive future growth. Meta has still been successful with the rise of Tik Tok, right? I don't think people have an issue necessarily with where Instagram is at and what meta is doing with some of their social platforms. But Snap could use the boost. And so that's sort of the stock to watch for me as this continues and if we ever do actually get any form of a ban. .Yeah, Snap for their own, you know, defense here, the brand of ghost face chilla, they said that their community grew to 460 million daily active users, an increase of 38 million year over year in the most recent quarter and Q1 here. Q1 revenue increased 14% year over year, 1.36 billion. And it really comes back to some of direct response advertising, DR advertising as they talk about it on the call. We got to get to this last one here as well. Finally, the Senate passing the genius stable coin bill and sending it to the house in a big legislative step for the crypto industry. The bill largely requires stable coin issuers align with the same regulations that tradfi, traditional financial institutions must follow. A broader bill that currently sits in the house called the Clarity Act, seeking to regulate the crypto market as a whole here. There you're taking a look at Coinbase, Robin Hood and Circle on the move to the upside on this passage here for the genius bill. .Another headline that makes Circle stock go up, right? It feels like that stock has gone up almost every day since it's IPO a few weeks ago. .Yes. .But the stable coin conversation feels like it's really starting to heat up right now, doesn't it? I was talking to Julie Hyman about this last week and just we get in these moments where everyone needs to have a coin or everyone needs to have a stable coin or everyone needs to have their AI strategy. And when you think about the report last week of Walmart and Amazon starting to look into this, I just wonder how that conversation grows if as this act continues to work its way through the house. How does that conversation grow to? How many companies are going to try and deploy some version of a stable coin strategy? And is that report that we got last week about Walmart and Amazon, was that a they're looking into it or how seriously are they looking into it and are you and I going to need to get Amazon stable coin at some point to use Prime? .Look, all we've been discussing in our morning meetings and afternoon meeting yesterday was that this might say might make meta say, hey, hold my beer. DM's coming back. You can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page.

2025-06-18 21:41:00,‘It'll Be One of the Most Important and Valuable AI Systems That Gets Built’: Why Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Is Pumping Billions Into This New Tech,"Zuckerberg says AI will automate advertising by 2026, transforming business workflows and fueling Meta’s strong stock performance and growth.","At a recent Stripe Sessions event, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined Stripe President John Collison to discuss the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) in business and the broader economy. Zuckerberg’s remarks provided a candid look at how Meta Platforms (META) is leveraging AI to automate advertising and reshape enterprise workflows, with significant implications for investors and the company’s stock performance..Zuckerberg acknowledged the rapid pace of AI development, stating, “AI is going to transform pretty much every category of product and every part of the economy.” He addressed the ongoing debate over whether the current enthusiasm represents a bubble, noting that even if it takes five to ten years for AI to permeate every enterprise workflow, progress has consistently outpaced expectations..Grains, Unrest, & Gold: What Middle East Tensions Mean for Your Portfolio Now.Solar Stocks Are Plunging on Trump’s Tax Bill.

He described a future where businesses no longer need to create their own ad creatives, identify target audiences, or measure campaign performance manually. Instead, “any business can come to us and say what their objective is, how much they're willing to pay to achieve those results, connect their bank account and then we just deliver as many results as we can. I think it'll be one of the most important and valuable AI systems that gets built,” he explained..Don’t Miss: .Move over Netflix & Disney: This Pre-IPO Startup Is Unlocking $2 Trillion in IP & Licensing Revenue.Global Content Battles Are Brewing — And This Pre-IPO Studio Just Raised $3.1M to Enter the Fight.Meta’s roadmap aims to enable fully automated AI advertising by 2026, allowing businesses to launch campaigns with minimal input — potentially just a business URL and a budget. AI will handle creative generation, targeting, and optimization, making advanced marketing accessible to companies of all sizes and reducing the need for specialized marketing expertise..Meta’s aggressive push into AI-powered automation is a key driver behind its strong stock performance in 2025. The company’s shares have surged 19% year-to-date, outperforming many of its tech peers. As of June 17, 2025, Meta’s stock currently sits just under $700, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s AI strategy and the broader digital advertising market.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/itll-one-most-important-valuable-134131299.html," The analysis of the risks associated with Meta's investment in a new AI system for automating advertising by 2026 reveals several potential areas of concern:  1. **Regulatory Risks**: Potential changes in regulations, particularly regarding data privacy and ad tech, could impact operations and increase costs.  2. **Market Competition**: Accelerated competition from other companies may lead to price wars or margin compression, affecting profitability.  3. **Supply Chain Risks**: Delays due to unavailability of advanced AI components could delay project timelines and increase expenses.  4. **Market Perception**: Negative perceptions about the future of advertising might affect investor sentiment in the short term.  5. **Cybersecurity Risks**: Increased reliance on AI for data handling may lead to cyberattacks compromising privacy or service integrity.  6. **Dependency Risks**: Over-reliance on advertising could make Meta vulnerable to economic downturns affecting consumer spending.  In conclusion, while the news suggests potential growth and transformation for Meta, these risks indicate that the stock's volatility is a consideration for investors."

This could increase compliance costs and hinder market competitiveness.  2. **Reputational Damage**: Backing a sweeping ban without considering broader implications could harm the companies' image in the eyes of consumers and investors, potentially leading to loss of trust and credibility.  3. **Economic Risk**: AI is a critical driver of innovation and economic growth. A long-term ban might stifle AI development, affecting related industries and slowing global economic growth, with potential impacts on job markets.  4. **Geopolitical Risk**: The U.S.'s influence in international affairs could be affected by such a ban, potentially impacting trade relations and international collaborations focused on AI.  Overall, these risks suggest the need for careful consideration of how stricter AI regulations might affect businesses, consumers, and the global economy."
2025-06-18 18:53:00,Meta seen generating at least $3 billion a year from new WhatsApp’s Updates ads,"Investing.com -- Meta Platforms’ latest move to monetize WhatsApp could add billions to its revenue over time, according to a new note from Morgan Stanley.","Investing.com -- Meta Platforms’ latest move to monetize WhatsApp could add billions to its revenue over time, according to a new note from Morgan Stanley..The company recently announced it will begin rolling out ads in the app’s Updates tab, with analysts seeing a clear path to generating $3 billion to $5 billion annually from the initiative, potentially rising to over $6 billion in a bull case..Meta (NASDAQ:META) will introduce ""Status ads"" within the Updates section of WhatsApp, which is used by roughly 1.5 billion users each day..Morgan Stanley explained that the ads will not appear in private messages or calls, and will rely on the Updates tab’s Status feature, which is conceptually similar to Instagram Stories..Meta is also said to be planning to add monetization tools in WhatsApp Channels, including Promoted Channels and Channel Subscriptions..“While 1.5bn users is significant, it’s important to remember that most (~95%) of WhatsApp users are outside of the U.S.,” Morgan Stanley wrote, noting that international monetization is typically lower..Still, the analysts believe Meta’s ad infrastructure and user scale could support “a ~$3bn–$5bn business.”.Their base scenarios assume Updates represents a high single-digit percentage of WhatsApp usage, or around 2–4 minutes of user time daily, monetized at levels near Pinterest’s international rates..The bull case envisions 12% of user time in Updates and monetization at Facebook’s rates, supporting “a path to $6bn+ of annual revenue,” which would add about 3% upside to Morgan Stanley’s current Meta revenue model..“This is a helpful multi-year framework,” the analysts said, emphasizing Meta’s ability to convert platform scale and ad tech into durable free cash flow growth..Related articles.Meta seen generating at least $3 billion a year from new WhatsApp’s Updates ads.Cantor bullish on analog stocks near-term, but challenges remain through year-end.Beyond Oil product could lower cancer risk from fried foods, medical opinion finds",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-seen-generating-least-3-105317563.html," The risk classification for Meta's expansion into WhatsApp through updates ads can be categorized as **Operational Integration Risk** and **Regulatory Exposure Risk**:  1. **Operational Integration Risk**:     - **Cultural and User Experience Challenges**: Merging two platforms with different cultures and user bases may lead to confusion or resistance, affecting user satisfaction.    - **Potential Inadequate Ad Performance**: If WhatsApp's adoption or the effectiveness of the ad model is lower than expected, revenue might not meet forecasts.  2. **Regulatory Exposure Risk**:    - **Increased Regulatory Scrutiny**: As a major company expanding into new markets, Meta may face more oversight and potential legal challenges if regulations are restrictive.    - **Competition from Direct Integrations**: Existing services like Facebook's direct integration might reduce WhatsApp's value or require Meta to adjust ad models.  These risks highlight the potential downsides while the upside includes significant revenue growth."

2025-06-18 18:30:00,Meta Platforms Stock Will Soar Over the Next 5 Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.,"Meta plans to roll out AI-powered ads across its various platforms.  Over the last five years, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has been one of the best names to own.  Its shares have generated a total return of 192%, far exceeding the S&P 500' index's total return of 102% over the same period.","The shares have advanced by nearly 200% over the last five years..Meta plans to roll out AI-powered ads across its various platforms..This could provide a new source of revenue for the social media titan..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Over the last five years, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has been one of the best names to own. Its shares have generated a total return of 192%, far exceeding the S&P 500' index's total return of 102% over the same period. Yet, I think Meta can match -- or even exceed -- its past performance thanks to the rise of AI-powered advertising..First, some background. Meta generates an incredible amount of revenue, nearly $175 billion annually, or roughly $500 million per day. Almost all -- around 97% -- comes from selling ad space across its platforms like Facebook and Instagram..Currently, most of those ads are designed and produced by advertising agencies. These companies work with brands to develop and track ad campaigns. Think Mad Men but updated for the 21st century. .That's where AI comes in. Meta has announced plans to begin rolling out AI-powered ads on its platform to allow brands to fully automate their advertising on Meta's systems by 2026..This is a big deal, because according to Statista, ad agencies in the U.S. alone generated nearly $64 billion in 2022. If Meta's AI-produced ads are a hit, the company could begin to take some share of this lucrative market away from traditional ad agencies..What's more, it's not a far-fetched idea. Many brands may be intrigued by what Meta's powerful AI could produce. In particular, Meta could use proprietary data to personalize ads, placing a custom-built ad into a user's feed..For example, Meta's AI could potentially use its powers of deduction to highlight the features most important to the prospective customer (safety, cost, reliability, etc.). In other words, these ads might be more effective than what ad agencies could ever hope to produce for a mass audience..In turn, Meta might land a new source of revenue, leading to further growth and a higher stock price. So, while there is still plenty of work to be done, AI-powered ads are one reason why investors should consider buying Meta stock right now..Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-stock-soar-over-103000980.html," The risk classification for Meta Platforms (META) stock based on the provided news and analysis is as follows:  ### **1. Market Risk** Meta Platforms' stock has shown exceptional growth over the past five years, with a total return of 192% compared to the S&P 500's 102%. However, market conditions can change rapidly, including shifts in investor sentiment, economic downturns, or broader market volatility. This could impact Meta's stock performance even if its current growth trajectory continues.  ### **2. Operational Risk** Meta's expansion into AI-powered ads introduces operational risks, such as:    - Regulatory challenges: Depending on the markets Meta expands into, it may face stricter regulations for AI advertising.    - Competitive risks: The tech industry is highly competitive, and Meta must maintain its market share in a dynamic environment.  ### **3. Financial Risk** If Meta borrows heavily to invest in AI infrastructure or expand its business, high debt levels could lead to:    - Increased interest expenses.    - Reduced financial flexibility if the expansion does not yield the expected returns.  ### **4. Reputational Risk** AI-powered ads may face user backlash or regulatory scrutiny, which could harm Meta's reputation and customer trust in its products.  ### **5. Geopolitical Risk** Meta's global expansion into markets with different digital regulations (e.g., India) introduces geopolitical risks:    - Regulatory challenges specific to certain countries.    - Potential disruptions due to changes in local policies or consumer behavior.  ### Summary:  While Meta Platforms' stock has shown strong growth, the associated risks include market volatility, operational challenges, financial risks related to debt and returns, reputational risks from user feedback or regulations, and geopolitical risks tied to its global expansion. These factors suggest that the risks are not negligible."

Mr Altman said that Mr Zuckerberg “thinks of [OpenAI] as their biggest competitor”..However, Mr Altman suggested that the huge signing bonuses could damage Meta’s company culture..He said: “I think the strategy of a tonne of upfront guaranteed [compensation] and that being the reason you tell someone to join, really the degree to which they are focusing on that and not the work and not the mission, I don’t think that is going to set up a great culture.”.OpenAI raised $40bn in funding in March as it seeks to develop powerful AI tools that Mr Altman has claimed could change society, work and scientific discovery..Its ChatGPT tool is used to write emails or automate tasks in the workplace, but Silicon Valley is betting hundreds of billions of dollars that a super-powerful “artificial general intelligence” could be on the horizon..Silicon Valley has been engulfed by a war for talent as tech giants seek to hire the brightest minds to develop new AI tools after the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT..Last year, Google paid $2.7bn to invest in Character AI, a chatbot business, in effect to re-hire its founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-offers-100m-signing-101630808.html," The analysis of the risk associated with Mark Zuckerberg offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach tech talent from Meta highlights several critical considerations:  1. **Potential Attrition**: The high incentives may lead to significant staff turnover, risking the loss of key employees and their collective expertise, which could impede AI development.  2. **Opportunity Cost**: The funds spent on bonuses could be better utilized elsewhere in the company's strategic initiatives or investments, potentially diverting resources from long-term goals.  3. **Substitute Risks**: The use of monetary incentives may create challenges if artificial substitutes for human skills become prevalent and cannot meet future demands.  4. **Short-Term Focus**: This strategy might prioritize immediate gains over long-term benefits, neglecting sustainable growth in talent pipeline building or innovation.  5. **Legal and Perceptual Implications**: The practice could affect brand perception and employee morale if viewed negatively by customers or teams, necessitating alignment with company values.  6. **Burnout Concerns**: Excessive attrition of top performers might reduce team cohesion and motivation, affecting overall performance.  In conclusion, while offering signing bonuses can attract talent, these risks must be carefully managed to ensure they align with long-term strategic goals and maintain cohesive company performance."

Overall, while the launch offers benefits to advertisers, these risks necessitate careful monitoring and strategic planning for IAS."
2025-06-18 15:45:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now,"Apple is one of the largest companies in the world, but its growth has slowed, and it is lagging in AI.  Amazon, meanwhile, is an AI leader, using the technology to drive growth and efficiencies.  Meta Platforms is also at the forefront of AI, using the technology to increase user engagement on its platform and improve the effectiveness of its ads.","Apple is one of the largest companies in the world, but its growth has slowed, and it is lagging in AI..Amazon, meanwhile, is an AI leader, using the technology to drive growth and efficiencies..Meta Platforms is also at the forefront of AI, using the technology to increase user engagement on its platform and improve the effectiveness of its ads..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.With a market capitalization of just a tad under $3 billion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the largest companies in the world. However, its revenue growth over the past few years has been modest, while much of its stock gains have come from multiple expansions, as its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been increasing..The company also appears to have fallen behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, with Apple Intelligence features reportedly consistently running into delays. In addition, some high-gross-margin revenue from a revenue-sharing agreement that allows Google to be the exclusive search engine for Safari on Apple devices is at risk after Alphabet lost an antitrust trial where the agreement was at the center of the case. While the company likely wouldn't lose all of this revenue, there is a risk that some of it would go away if it gave users the option to choose their default search engine..Against this background, the upside for Apple may be limited over the next several years, opening the door for other companies to become larger than Apple. Let's look at two companies that could exceed Apple's market cap in the next five years..With a market cap of roughly $2.3 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is well-positioned to overtake Apple in size over the next few years. The company is the market-share leader in two important segments: e-commerce and cloud computing. And while Apple has lagged on the AI front, Amazon has gone all in, incorporating AI throughout its businesses to help make them more efficient and drive growth..Its e-commerce business has settled into being a high single-digit, low double-digit percentage revenue grower. The segment is seeing strong margin expansion and operating leverage, which are powering profitability growth. Its high-gross margin, sponsored-ad business is playing a big part, with revenue climbing 19% year over year last quarter to $13.9 billion..Amazon is also seeing a lot of operational efficiencies. The company now incorporates AI throughout its warehouse and logistics operations to improve efficiencies and lower costs. It is developing AI-powered robots that can perform multiple tasks and even detect damaged items, helping the company save money on labor and costly returns. Meanwhile, it's using AI in its logistics business to help drivers save time and fuel by planning better routes and helping them more easily locate hard-to-find addresses in places like large apartment complexes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-thatll-worth-074500784.html," The article discusses two stocks that could potentially outperform Apple within five years, focusing on companies leading in AI such as Amazon and Meta. However, several risks are identified:  1. **Market Volatility**: The stock market is inherently volatile, so the performance of these companies can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions and technological trends.  2. **Increased Competition**: The rise of other tech giants using AI effectively may intensify competition, leading to market instability as investors shift between companies unpredictably.  3. **Regulatory Changes**: Shifts in regulations related to data privacy, antitrust laws, or tech monopolies could impact these companies' performance and introduce financial risks.  4. **Economic Downturns**: A recession might reduce consumer spending on technology products, affecting growth rates for Apple and possibly Amazon as well, despite its diversified revenue streams.  In summary, the primary risks are market volatility due to economic factors and technological advancements, increased competition from other tech companies, potential regulatory impacts, and external economic conditions affecting consumer spending."
2025-06-18 13:00:00,Why the UK's AIM is struggling 30 years on,The UK's alternative investment market has seen some major successes since launching 30 years ago but has recently struggled to attract and retain companies.,"The UK's alternative investment market (AIM) has seen some major successes since its inception 30 years ago but has struggled to attract and retain companies in recent years..Launched on 19 June 1995, AIM was set up to help smaller and high-growth companies get more access to capital. When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L). ""As a result, we’re seeing many of the biggest and best AIM companies moving to a main market listing.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-uk-aim-struggling-alternative-investment-050024609.html," The news about the UK's AIM market struggling to attract and retain companies presents several key risks:  1. **Concentration Risk**: With fewer companies listed on AIM, investors may face higher risk as the market becomes concentrated in specific sectors or businesses, increasing vulnerability to sector-specific downturns.  2. **Diversification Risk**: Reduced diversity among listed companies can lead to overexposure in certain areas, making the market less resilient to economic shocks in those sectors.  3. **Capital Flow Issues**: A decline in AIM companies may result in fewer investment opportunities, affecting capital flow and potentially reducing options for retail investors seeking alternative investments.  4. **Liquidity Concerns**: With fewer companies listed on AIM, selling investments quickly or at fair value becomes more challenging, impacting investor liquidity.  5. **Investor Sentiment Downturn**: Struggling to attract and retain companies could erode confidence in the alternative investment space, leading to reduced future interest from investors.  6. **Regulatory Challenges**: Potential difficulties in managing or listing companies on AIM might signal regulatory issues, causing uncertainty and possibly shifting investor preferences towards safer options.  7. **Precedent Setting**: This situation might deter new companies from joining AIM, hindering market growth and stability.  In summary, the risks primarily revolve around concentration and diversification, liquidity, capital flow, investor sentiment, regulatory impact, and market growth potential."

Let’s unpack why this deal could be transformative for Meta..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.Meta is experiencing strong momentum in the AI space. In Q1, the company reported a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad pricing, driven by enhanced targeting capabilities across Reels and Stories on Instagram and Facebook, which now serve a combined 3.43 billion daily active users. Meta AI, positioned as a competitor to ChatGPT, is approaching one billion monthly users and is already powering personalized content feeds and early-stage trials of AI-integrated smart glasses, highlighting Meta’s unparalleled global reach..The potential addition of Scale AI, a leading data-labeling company valued at $29 billion, could further accelerate Meta’s AI innovation. Scale AI generated $870 million in revenue last year and is on track to reach $2 billion this year, underscoring its significant role in refining machine learning models. When added to META’s revenues, Scale appears value accretive..Scale’s capabilities could directly support Meta’s AI infrastructure and enhance applications like WhatsApp Business, which now serves over 100 million businesses and is expected to become a key driver of revenue growth as AI-driven customer engagement tools gain traction. For instance, AI-powered chatbots that anticipate customer needs could help small businesses drive sales. Additionally, Scale’s data assets might elevate Meta’s Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, enabling advanced features such as real-time translation or navigation that could rival offerings from competitors like Google’s Gemini..The decision to acquire a 49% non-voting stake in Scale AI appears to be a strategic move, particularly in an environment where regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech remains intense. Meta’s prior acquisitions—such as Instagram and WhatsApp—continue to attract attention from antitrust authorities, and a full acquisition of Scale could have raised similar concerns. By allowing Scale to operate independently, Meta avoids potential antitrust issues while still gaining access to the company’s talent, led by CEO Alexandr Wang, and its valuable data infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-bets-14-230500025.html," The investment by Meta Platforms (META) into Scale AI with a $14.3 billion stake and the establishment of a superintelligence lab poses several key risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The substantial investment may lead to market sentiment swings, affecting META's stock price without a full understanding of all implications.  2. **Uncertainty Surrounding Leadership**: The role of Alexandr Wang as CEO in the superintelligence lab introduces doubt about his effectiveness and past performance in this field.  3. **Potential Market Reaction Overvaluation**: There is a risk that META's stock may be prematurely valued due to media hype, leading to short-term market fluctuations.  4. **Regulatory Risks**: Unforeseen regulatory challenges or oversight could impact the success of the AI lab and affect META financially.  5. **Competition Intensity**: Increased competition from tech giants like Google and Amazon in the AI space may weaken META's market position.  6. **Integration and Innovation Challenges**: The integration of superintelligence into existing ad tech might strain resources if not managed carefully, risking innovation dilution.  7. **Technological Uncertainty**: Rapid advancements in AI could lead to underperformance or unforeseen challenges, affecting META's investments and growth.  8. **Potential Failures**: The AI lab may face technical difficulties, funding issues, or management problems, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.  These risks collectively highlight the need for careful consideration of both the potential benefits and pitfalls of Meta's strategic investment in AI technology."
2025-06-18 05:08:00,Threads Adds Expanded Fediverse Engagement Options,Threads users can now view posts from other fediverse-connected servers.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Yeah, I’m still convinced that Meta’s ever going to go all-in on fediverse sharing, and its support of decentralized social media via a network of independent servers..But it is pushing forward with its fediverse experiments in Threads, with the platform today getting a couple of new features for fediverse-connected users..To recap, at launch, Meta made a commitment to ensuring that Threads would be interoperable with fediverse servers, meaning that, in theory, you would one day be able to follow users from other decentralized social apps, like Mastodon, within Threads. You’d be able to engage, interact, all via different servers, and over the past year, Threads has added various fediverse sharing options to facilitate external interconnection. .To be clear, Threads is not fully open to other platforms as yet, but you can share your updates to other fediverse servers, and have people follow you from other platforms..And today Threads is expanding this, with fediverse-connected users now able to also see posts from federated users in the app..As you can see in this example, you’ll now be able to view posts within Threads that were shared to other fediverse servers. Those posts will include their handles on other apps..You’ll also be able to search for fediverse-connected users via Threads:.Though not all federated servers will be available..For one, they have to be using the same protocol as Threads. Federated servers can only communicate with each other if, essentially, they speak the same language, and Threads is able to translate ActivityPub protocols, which is the same system that powers Mastodon, Bookwyrm, WriteFreely and others..Mastodon is clearly the biggest of these, though with only around 1.4 million active users at present, there’s not a heap of expanded opportunity there..The largest decentralized social app is Bluesky, but that’s built on AT Protocol, so, at this stage at least, it can’t communicate with Threads..That may change in future, but right now, even this expanded decentralized linkage is fairly limited..Is it that big of a deal either way? Do users really care about fediverse connection?.Well, it depends on who you ask. .Last week, TechCrunch’s Sara Perez wrote an overview of the expanded potential of Bluesky, and decentralized social media more broadly, in which she noted that the real benefit of decentralized social platforms is that provide more options, and personal control over your in-app experience:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threads-adds-expanded-fediverse-engagement-210839290.html," **Risk Analysis of News Article: Expansion of Threads in Fediverse**  1. **Competition Risk**:     - The expansion into the Fediverse could increase competition with existing platforms like Mastodon. This may lead to market saturation and slower growth as new entrants vie for user attention.  2. **Security and Privacy Concerns**:    - Integrating multiple blockchain networks introduces potential security risks. Users' sensitive information could be exposed if platform measures aren't robust against network vulnerabilities.  3. **Regulatory Challenges**:    - Depending on the geographical reach, Threads may face varying regulations, which can complicate operations and potentially lead to legal issues.  4. **Market Adoption Risk**:    - There might be resistance from users who are currently satisfied with their platforms. This could slow down adoption rates initially and affect user satisfaction in the short term.  5. **Technical Risks**:    - Integration complexities could result in technical issues such as slow performance or broken links, affecting user experience and engagement.  6. **Competitive Landscape Risk**:    - The fierce competition within blockchain platforms could lead to Threads being outpaced by competitors, risking market share decline without external support.  In summary, while the expansion offers potential benefits, significant risks exist that require careful management to ensure sustainable growth and user satisfaction."

He noted that CoreWeave is trading at 27 times its projected 2027 earnings and highlighted its significant debt..""Historically, CoreWeave has funded 85% of capex with debt,"" Sills wrote in a note to clients on Monday. CoreWeave is set to spend up to $23 billion in 2025, a figure that surprised Wall Street analysts and sent the stock down in May immediately following its first-ever earnings report as a public company..Despite the downgrade, Sills raised his price outlook on the stock to $185 from $76, the highest among Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg..Sills cited capital expenditures on AI, which he said are ""still very healthy"" while arguing that the ""growth rate is peaking."".""[W]e see solid sustained demand in CoreWeave's AI infrastructure market,"" Sills wrote. He said AI capital expenditures are set to grow 4% in 2027 to $206 billion, but that growth is much less than the 65% jump in AI capex in 2025..""The top-line momentum is strong, though access to debt is critical to support the business,"" he wrote. Sills cited CoreWeave's expanded deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). CoreWeave in May secured a $4 billion deal with the ChatGPT maker in addition to its previously reported $11.9 billion commitment from the AI startup..CoreWeave is one of the largest holders of Nvidia's (NVDA) graphics processing units and rents its data-center capacity to Big Tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as their own stores of GPUs haven't been sufficient to power their AI ambitions. CoreWeave uses its debt, borrowed at high interest rates against its store of Nvidia GPUs as collateral, to buy more Nvidia chips. Nvidia is also a major investor in and customer of the AI cloud firm..The company has added more than $64 billion to its market cap — which stood at $82.7 billion on Tuesday afternoon — since its March IPO..In a note to clients on Monday, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill also gave a nod of approval to CoreWeave, listing the company among the investing firm's top AI stocks and reiterating his $180 price target on shares..""CRWV is the fastest growing vendor in our AI coverage ... and we believe their infrastructure has more durability than most think,"" Thill wrote.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-stock-surge-brings-post-ipo-rally-to-340-after-unusually-positive-analyst-downgrade-201851012.html," The news about CoreWeave's stock involves two conflicting signals: a positive short-term rally and an analyst downgrade with a higher price target. Here's how this creates risk:  1. **Volatility**: The immediate stock jump could lead to increased market volatility as investors interpret the situation differently.  2. **Uncertainty**: The analyst's downgrade suggests potential concerns about future performance, despite the positive news, which can cause uncertainty in investor sentiment.  3. **Potential Overvaluation**: If the market has already incorporated concerns from the downgrade and raised its price target, there could be a correction if the company does not perform as expected.  4. **Strategic Impact**: The combination of an upgrade with a price target adjustment might confuse or mislead some investors about the company's true prospects.  In summary, this situation creates risk through market volatility, uncertainty, potential overvaluation, and strategic confusion, which could lead to short-term fluctuations in stock prices."

Additionally, increased focus on Reels might affect how other types of content are perceived and accessed by users. However, these risks are speculative and not immediate threats, as the change appears to be an internal reorganization rather than a major shift in strategy.  **Risk Classification:** - **Low Risk:** The change is more of an internal adjustment without clear, immediate consequences. Potential impacts on user experience could be mitigated with careful communication and adaptation strategies. There's no mention of significant disruptions or risks related to security, competition, or platform performance beyond what Facebook might already be preparing for.

2025-06-18 02:25:00,WhatsApp’s new ad feature sparks backlash—and a golden opportunity for Signal,"As concerns over surveillance and data harvesting mount, the secure messaging wars are heating up.","Meta’s decision to introduce advertisements into WhatsApp has reignited competition in the secure messaging space, giving rival app Signal a fresh opening to make a pitch for users..Most Read from Fast Company.Housing market weakness triggers Lennar to offer biggest incentives since 2009.The Trump administration is trying to bring back asbestos.3 tiny behaviors that make you the calmest person in the room.After the tech giant announced it would begin to include ads in WhatsApp’s Updates tab, which is used by roughly 1.5 billion people per day, Signal president Meredith Whittaker took to X to lure users to her messaging tool: “Use Signal,” she wrote. “We promise, no AI clutter, no surveillance ads—whatever the rest of the industry does.”.Signal and WhatsApp have long competed to attract encryption-minded users. Meta’s promises that its new WhatsApp ad features would be implemented “in the most privacy-oriented way possible” have done little to quell doubts. Max Schrems, a data privacy advocate who runs the European nonprofit NOYB (which stands for “None of Your Business”), warned that with the addition of ads, Meta was blatantly ignoring European Union privacy laws..“Meta seems to follow the approach by the Trump administration and simply ignores EU rules as somehow ‘illegitimate,’” Schrems wrote in a blog post. “European regulators urgently need to take clear action.” A Meta spokesperson says Schrems’ response is “inaccurate and mischaracterizes the update,” adding that “using Meta ad preferences to show ads on WhatsApp is completely optional and off by default.”.Privacy concerns over Meta’s data practices reached a fever pitch in 2018 with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In 2021, WhatsApp saw another wave of users migrate to Signal after a privacy policy update allowed for increased data sharing with businesses and third parties..Monday’s addition of ads raised more concerns. As Lena Cohen, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) told Fast Company this week: “The fact that Meta has promised that it’s adding ads to WhatsApp with privacy in mind does not make me trust this new feature.”.Signal is adept at turning such moments into branding opportunities. Earlier this year, it saw a surge in sign-ups in the midst of the “Signalgate” national security crisis—when a journalist from The Atlantic was accidentally added to a private Signal group chat involving the highest levels of government that discussed, in real time, an imminent U.S. military strike—in part because it became part of the national discussion, but also because Signal ensured the story wasn’t spun to blame the app for the leak",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whatsapp-ad-feature-sparks-backlash-182513808.html," The article discusses WhatsApp's new ad feature causing backlash and providing an opportunity for Signal, highlighting concerns over surveillance and data harvesting. The risk level can be categorized as follows:  1. **Reputational Risk**: Enhanced privacy concerns may lead to a loss of public trust, affecting WhatsApp's reputation and market position.  2. **Competitive Risk**: The situation offers a potential time window for Signal to gain traction, impacting WhatsApp's competitive edge in the secure messaging market.  3. **Operational Risk**: There is a possibility that WhatsApp's ad feature could be misused or found to improperly collect data, potentially leading to legal scrutiny.  Overall, the risk level is moderate, primarily reputational and operational, with potential competition-related challenges."

2025-06-18 01:56:00,Facebook announces that all videos on its platform will soon be shared as reels,"Facebook announced on Tuesday that all videos on its platform will soon be shared as reels, regardless of their length or orientation.","Facebook announced on Tuesday that all videos on its platform will soon be shared as reels, regardless of their length or orientation. Up until now, users have been able to share both video posts and reels. The company is also renaming the “Video” tab on its platform to the “Reels” tab. The update won’t change what videos are recommended to you, Facebook says..In the coming months, users won’t have to choose between uploading a video or reel, as it will automatically be shared as a reel. In addition, reels on Facebook won’t be bound by length or format restrictions. (Currently, reels on Facebook can only be 90 seconds long.).The idea behind the changes is to streamline the video-sharing format on the social network. It won’t be the first time that a Meta-owned platform has done so, as Instagram began automatically converting new video posts under 15 minutes into reels back in 2022..“Previously, you’d upload a video to Feed or post a reel using different creative flows and tools for each format,” Facebook explained in a blog post. “Now, we’re bringing these experiences together with a simplified publishing flow that gives you access to even more creative tools. We’ll also give you control over your audience setting of who sees your reels.”.The change is likely to upset some users, as it may pose some challenges..For example, it could be annoying to post a horizontal video if it gets uploaded into a vertical reels format. Plus, users may not want to see longer videos mixed in with short ones..As part of the change, users’ default settings will now be the same for the Feed and reels. When users start to post reels after the change, they will be prompted to confirm their audience setting to determine who can see their reels: everyone, their friends, or a select group of people..Following the update, Facebook says that it will remain a place for all sorts of video content, whether it’s short, long, or Live..The company says it will gradually roll out the changes globally over the coming months.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-announces-videos-platform-soon-175639080.html," The announcement by Facebook to enforce reels on all video content presents several significant risks:  1. **Loss of User Engagement**: Traditional videos may become less engaging under reel format, leading to user dissatisfaction and potential loss of engagement.  2. **Content Type Impact**: Users accustomed to longer-form videos might find their content removed or changed, disrupting existing sharing habits.  3. **Platform Conflicts**: Third-party apps with their own video policies could face incompatibility issues, potentially reducing cross-platform usability.  4. **Revenue Shifts**: Creators and advertisers may face changes in revenue models, with potential losses if they can't adapt to the reel format.  5. **User Backlash and Technical Challenges**: There could be negative feedback from users and technical challenges during the transition process.  Overall, this decision poses high risks due to its significant impact on user experience, content sharing, competition, and financial implications for Facebook."

Now Threads users will be able to see posts from other users on the fediverse within a dedicated feed if they’ve opted in to fediverse sharing on Threads. Plus, people will be able to search for fediverse users directly in Threads..Posts from federated users will be found on the Following tab of the Threads app. They don’t appear in line with the other posts from Threads users, however. Instead, you’ll tap on a link at the top of the feed to view these posts in a separate feed..Threads can pull in posts made on federated apps like Mastodon, BookWyrm, WriteFreely, and others, with more services to be supported over time..According to Threads engineer Peter Cottle, users will see the top-level posts from the fediverse in this feed but aren’t yet able to reply. (They can see fediverse replies to their own posts, however, but that’s in a different part of the app.).In addition, Threads users will be able to search and discover fediverse profiles in the Threads app, including those for WordPress bloggers who have activated fediverse sharing, Flipboard users, and those on Mastodon, among others..The features are designed to make Threads feel more like a federated app, meaning one that’s connected to the wider network of interconnected social media servers that make up the decentralized open social web..Though Threads has not completed this integration, with over 350 million monthly active users, it’s the largest app running on the ActivityPub protocol, which powers the X rival Mastodon and other federated apps..First launched in July 2023, Threads to date has taken inspiration from traditional social networks like X, as well as those operating on open source protocols, like Mastodon and Bluesky. Like Bluesky, Threads introduced the concept of custom feeds as well as its version of Starter Packs, to help users find people to follow. And like Mastodon, Threads is more directly tied into the fediverse, allowing people to connect with others who are not directly on Threads..Since its debut, Threads has introduced features that allow its users to opt in to share their posts on the fediverse, see replies on their posts from those on Mastodon, follow users’ profiles on other fediverse servers, and see who follows them in return..In June, Threads expanded fediverse sharing functionality to the EU after prior launches in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. Meta says that Threads has interacted with over 75% of all fediverse servers since launching the fediverse sharing feature a year ago..However, the company has not yet provided an update on when it would be fully integrated with the fediverse, nor when it would introduce account portability. That would allow Threads users to move their account somewhere else if they ever decided Meta’s policies weren’t to their liking. It’s a key aspect for open, decentralized apps, as it puts control in the hands of users instead of the platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threads-expands-open-social-integrations-163758987.html," **Risk Classification: No Risk**  The news about Threads expanding its integrations with Fediverse and user profile searches does not indicate any immediate risks. While potential areas like data security or operational complexity exist, no specific information was provided to suggest these could pose current risks. Thus, based on the available details, this news is classified as having no identified risk at this time."

This follows last May's text-prompt image generator and October's image-to-GIF tool, showing Meta's steady push to bake generative AI into its ad stack..Video typically drives higher engagement but demands more time and budget. By automating the process, Meta lowers the barrier for small and mid-sized advertisers to tap into video formats, potentially boosting ad spend and stickiness on its platforms.

These risks highlight potential challenges for Meta as it navigates the complexities of integrating AI into its advertising offerings."

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Facebook’s going all in on Reels, literally, with all videos in the app soon to be classed as Reels, and fed into the Reels feed..As explained by Facebook: .“In the coming months, all videos on Facebook will be shared as reels, eliminating the need to choose between uploading a video or Reel. Reels on Facebook will also not have any length or format restrictions.”.So rather than you having to specifically chose “Reel” in the post upload flow, any video that you attach to a post will now be classed as a Reel..Except livestreams. Live content will still fall into its own category, with its own separate capture and upload flow. And while live videos may also be displayed within the Reels feed, they won't be classified as Reels content..But every other video type else will now be fed into the expanding river of Reels content..“Previously, you’d upload a video to Feed or post a Reel using different creative flows and tools for each format. Now, we’re bringing these experiences together with a simplified publishing flow that gives you access to even more creative tools. We’ll also give you control over your audience setting of who sees your Reels.”.In terms of your video metrics, Meta says that video and Reels metrics will now be consolidated into Reels analytics. .“You'll retain crucial insights like 3-second and 1-minute views. If you use Meta Business Suite, you will be able to access historical metrics for Reels and videos through the end of the year, but all metrics for future video posts will be consolidated into and displayed as Reels.”.The change will also be reflected in Meta's content monetization programs, with Meta further noting that payouts will remain consistent ""as long as the amount of content that you’re sharing and engagement levels stay relatively steady."".It’s also renaming the “Video” tab the “Reels” tab instead:.So Reels have gone from 60 seconds in length at launch (on Facebook), to 90 seconds in 2023, to all videos of all kinds today. That reflects the rising popularity of the format, which is now the key driver of time spent in the app..Indeed, last month, as part of its FTC antitrust trial, Meta shared this chart, underlining the shift towards Reels on Facebook over time..Reels is where Facebook derives the most engagement benefit, and as such, it makes sense for Meta to make this more of a focus, and to feed even more content into its Reels content stream, in order to drive more time spent.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-announces-video-uploads-now-152011247.html," The analysis of Facebook's announcement regarding transitioning all video uploads to Reels identifies several aspects that could impact the company:  1. **Market Competition**: The move into Reels may affect competitive landscapes but isn't inherently a risk unless it leads to content dilution or reduced variety.  2. **Technological Risk**: Potential user confusion and initial lower engagement are risks, though effective marketing can mitigate these issues.  3. **Regulatory Factors**: Compliance in regions with strict regulations is crucial; potential challenges could arise if not managed properly.  4. **Financial Implications**: Transition costs require careful budgeting to avoid financial strain, but successful adoption could open new revenue streams.  5. **User Experience**: The shift from longer videos to Reels may confuse users, necessitating a smooth transition phase.  6. **Revenue Models**: Ad strategy adjustments are necessary; failure to adapt could impact ad revenue and ad support services.  7. **Security Risks**: Vulnerabilities in the new format require robust security measures to prevent breaches and data misuse.  8. **Brand Reputation**: Negative user feedback on technical issues or experience can harm brand image, necessitating proactive management.  9. **Operational Efficiency**: The transition requires significant resources; delays could affect platform operations.  10. **Market Position**: Being first in Reels adoption may maintain a competitive edge but could be undermined by hasty moves without proper testing.  11. **Customer Satisfaction**: The impact hinges on user experience and support, crucial for retention.  Overall, the potential risks are more in areas of user experience and operational efficiency rather than a fundamental threat to Facebook's business model. These factors can be managed with careful planning and proactive strategies, aligning with both opportunities and necessary precautions."

The company’s expanding partner base that includes tech giants and financial institutions position SMR as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy. The company is gaining strong momentum across various sectors, especially as energy demands continue to rise. The increasing energy demand, driven by sectors like data centers, which require continuous, reliable, and carbon-free energy, has been a major growth driver.Data centers are expected to triple their energy use over the next three years, accounting for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. This growth trend presents a significant opportunity for NuScale Power, as its small modular reactor technology offers consistent, carbon-free energy that can meet the increasing demands of hyperscale data centers.NuScale Power continues to attract strong interest from major technology companies and infrastructure capital. Companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet and Oracle have made substantial commitments to using nuclear energy, including SMR technology, to meet their sustainability goals, which positively impacts NuScale Power’s market positioning.The company also made significant strides in the manufacturing and commercialization of its SMR technology, including progress with key partners like Doosan Interability and ENTRA1 Energy, which further solidified its position in the market..SMR is facing stiff competition in the small modular reactor sector of the nuclear energy industry against the likes of Oklo OKLO and BWX Technologies BWXT.In May 2025, OKLO signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to collaborate on the development and global deployment of its advanced nuclear technology. This partnership aims to jointly advance the design and verification of Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse and cooperate on early project development efforts. This collaboration is expected to strengthen OKLO’s position in the global nuclear energy market.BWX Technologies secured historic manufacturing contracts in 2025 for two major nuclear energy projects, which include providing support for the life extension of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station and the deployment of a new small modular reactor at the Darlington site. This is expected to strengthen BWX Technologies’ position in the global nuclear energy market..SMR shares have surged 137% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s appreciation of 1.2% and the Zacks Electronics- Power Generation industry’s rise of 110.8%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuscale-powers-smr-tech-gains-143500600.html," The news about NuScale Power's SMR technology gaining traction primarily relates to its potential for revenue growth in the carbon-free energy sector.

As of right now, Meta has generated a year-to-date return of 16.7%, beating out all other Magnificent Seven stocks.","Year to date, Meta Platforms is the best-performing stock within the Magnificent Seven..The company's plan to automate ad creation on its platforms by 2026 could provide a lucrative new revenue stream for the digital ad giant..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Quick, what's the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock so far this year?.If you answered Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), you'd be right -- at least as of this writing. As of right now, Meta has generated a year-to-date return of 16.7%, beating out all other Magnificent Seven stocks. Only one other stock -- Microsoft -- boasts a double-digit gain so far this year. Nvidia, the hottest stock of the last five years, has only generated a return of 6% as of this writing..So, is Meta now the best AI stock around? Let's take a closer look..First, let's get one thing clear: Meta spent big on AI. We're talking tens of billions of dollars, with tens of billions more to come over the next few years. The company spent lavishly on the metaverse, but also on AI infrastructure and data centers..Of course, simply spending money doesn't guarantee a return. However, Meta's AI spending now appears far more focused than it did in years past. Specifically, the company has a plan to fully automate ad creation and placement across its suite of platforms such as Facebook and Instagram by 2026..This could represent a revolution in how ads are created and how ad campaigns are run. In theory, Meta could cut out ad agency middlemen that charge lavish fees before an ad ever reaches a customer. Furthermore, Meta could use its enormous trove of user data to personalize ads, potentially increasing the return on investment for ad buyers. .In addition to its AI-powered ads strategy, Meta has other bullish catalysts on its side. Take its Threads product, which competes with X (formerly known as Twitter). Meta's Threads is now attracting 320 million to 350 million monthly active users (MAUs). That's up from about 150 million a year ago..Combine Meta's AI initiatives with the growth of Threads and the company's excellent first-quarter results, and Wall Street is turning even more bullish on shares of Meta. .Analysts from major firms, including Bank of America and RBC raised their price targets for Meta's stock recently.

Specifically, it delivers the high-fidelity labels needed for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)..Related: Meta commits absurd money to top Google, Microsoft in critical race.Simply put, it’s how humans guide AI by giving feedback so it learns to make better choices..AI bellwethers like OpenAI and Google  (GOOGL)  have leaned on these human-verified datasets, a role OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar recently deemed “critical” in maintaining a healthy AI ecosystem..Naturally, investors took notice..A $100 million boost from Founders Fund in 2019 helped Scale jump past billion-dollar unicorn status.

Strategic missteps could require significant investments, straining resources.  4. **Reputational Risks**: Unsuccessful AI initiatives could damage Google's reputation, affecting investor confidence and consumer trust.  5. **Economic Pressures**: Over-competition may lead to economic downturns in related sectors like hardware, software, and cloud services due to price wars.  6. **Technological Risks**: Rapid advancements in AI could render Google's strategy obsolete if they don't keep pace with developments.  7. **Cybersecurity Risks**: Increased focus on AI development might expose vulnerabilities to cyber threats, posing potential risks.  8. **Financial Risks**: The cost of AI development could strain financial resources beyond what was already planned.

It seems that every week, there's a new development happening in the space. This further drives excitement from industry participants and observers. .It's becoming more difficult to argue that AI is just hype. Businesses are investing billions of dollars to position themselves to become AI leaders. Users are finding the various apps to be valuable tools to boost productivity and efficiency..From an investing perspective, it's time to put money to work. Here are two top AI stocks to buy right now..One AI stock to consider adding to your portfolio is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The company just announced a partnership with OpenAI that would make Alphabet's Google Cloud a computing provider for the ChatGPT creator.. Before this, Alphabet announced plans to purchase cloud security company Wiz for $32 billion, in an effort to bolster its security capabilities in an AI era..The other AI stock to purchase today is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Like Alphabet, this business isn't shying away from trying to strike deals of its own. It is reportedly ready to invest $14 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data labeling company..And looking ahead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to keep his foot on Meta's gas pedal. He's trying to put together a team of experts to create AI superintelligence. Scale AI's founder and CEO Alexandr Wang will be on this elite team..Another key reason why both of these dominant businesses are top AI plays is because they have virtually limitless financial resources to push forward. Combined, they had $166 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on their balance sheets as of March 31..Investors know Alphabet and Meta as two powerful tech enterprises. The former owns some of the most widely used internet properties, like Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. The latter runs insanely popular social media apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Both companies have billions of users, giving them unrivaled reach..However, it's not a shock that AI is management's top priority these days. For Alphabet, this means making its crown-jewel search engine more useful. The AI Overviews feature was officially released over a year ago, and it's now being monetized at about the same rate as traditional Search. Perhaps the fears about the search engine market being completely disrupted by AI were overblown.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-000000144.html," The news about Alphabet's partnership with OpenAI presents several potential risks:  1. **Market Competition Risk**: Increased competition in the AI sector could challenge Alphabet's market position and revenue growth.  2. **Regulatory Risks**: The collaboration might lead to new regulations or ethical issues that require compliance, potentially causing legal complications and financial penalties.  3. **Intellectual Property Concerns**: The partnership with OpenAI could expose Alphabet to IP disputes or licensing obligations affecting profitability.  4. **Partnership Success Uncertainty**: The integration of ChatGPT into Google Cloud may underperform, impacting revenue projections.  5. **Competitive Landscape Risk**: Increased investments in AI by other tech companies might threaten Alphabet's dominance and growth trajectory.

However, the strength of these factors needs to be evaluated to ensure they are robust enough to justify the high target price.  4. **Competitive Landscape**: Meta's position in the AI and advertising space should be considered relative to competitors. Any changes in competition or technological advancements could impact META's lead.  5. **Interest in AI Stocks**: The fact that Meta is among 12 AI stocks every investor should watch might indicate sensitivity to market movements, which can fluctuate based on broader market conditions.  6. **Unexpected Risks**: Unforeseen events such as interest rate changes, consumer spending trends, or regulatory issues could affect META's performance despite the positive upgrade.

The news that Meta has committed to further increasing its AI spending is being viewed as a sign that Arm's relationship with Meta could become even more lucrative than was originally thought..Arm will keep licensing its cores and other technology to other chipmakers, but this pivot into designing its own chips too could help accelerate its earnings and revenue growth, especially given the customers it has lined up. However, it is also facing accusations in court and complaints filed with numerous regulators by one of its most important customers, Qualcomm, which alleges that it breached its license agreements and is engaging in anticompetitive behaviors. Arm could be forced to alter its business practices and may face steep fines if those allegations are found to be true. Given the uncertainty around how these cases could play out and the stock's lofty price-to-earnings ratio of more than 180, I would avoid Arm shares for now..Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively..Stocks broadly moved higher today following a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that military strikes between Israel and Iran could de-escalate in the near future. In addition to the broader market trend, Meta Platforms' share price also got a boost from an announcement about its WhatsApp platform and positive coverage from analysts..Before the market opened this morning, Oppenheimer published a new note on Meta Platforms. The investment firm maintained an outperform rating on the stock and increased its one-year price target from $665 per share to $775 per share. As of today's market close, the new price target still implied additional upside of roughly 10%. Oppenheimer's analysts cited improvements in the digital-advertising market as a key factor behind its price-target increase..Meta announced today that it is rolling out channel subscriptions and in-platform advertisements on its WhatsApp messaging platform. Promoted channels and advertisements will now be featured in the WhatsApp Updates tab. While some users may not be thrilled with the changes, the move should help Meta monetize the large and highly engaged user base on its WhatsApp platform..In addition to integrating ads into the service, Meta has been experimenting with WhatsApp as a platform that can host artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot services for customer service applications. WhatsApp reportedly now has more than 3 billion active users a month, and there's a good chance that Meta will continue exploring ways to generate more revenue from the platform..Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

In summary, while the news presents positive opportunities, it also carries significant risks that could impact Meta's stock performance in the long term."

While AGI represents a groundbreaking milestone in technology, there are significant risks associated with its development and deployment:  1. **Technological Domino Effect**: The rapid advancement towards AGI could lead to unintended consequences, such as accelerating progress in AI-related technologies beyond what was initially intended, potentially causing unforeseen societal and economic disruptions.  2. **Market Volatility**: The stock market reaction to Meta's progress on the AGI front could be highly volatile, with investors either panicking or investing heavily based on uncertainties and potential outcomes.  3. **Ethical and Regulatory Risks**: The development of AGI raises ethical concerns about privacy, job displacement, and societal impact, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges if not managed responsibly.  4. **Potential for Misuse**: Once AGI is achieved, it may be misused in ways that were not originally intended, leading to security risks and ethical dilemmas.  Given these factors, the risk classification for this news article reflects significant potential negative outcomes related to technological advancement and its societal implications."

This situation introduces significant risks related to the competition and fragmentation within the advertising market.  1. **Competition in Ad-Supported Platforms**: The entry of WhatsApp ads creates direct competition with existing platforms like Facebook's premium services (e.g., Facebook Chat Ads). This competition can lead to shifts in user preference, as users may choose WhatsApp due to its free nature and wide availability, potentially reducing ad revenue for Meta.  2. **Shift in Ad Budgets**: With multiple ad-supported platforms available, advertisers might allocate their budgets across both platforms, leading to underperformance in either or both. This diversification of ad revenue streams could reduce the effectiveness of any single platform's advertising strategy.  3. **User Preference and Engagement**: The presence of ad-supported platforms like WhatsApp can attract users who prefer a free and widely accessible messaging app over premium services with more intrusive ads. This shift may diminish the appeal of premium platforms, affecting their ability to retain ad revenue.  4. **Market Ecosystem Challenges**: As platforms introduce ad-supported options, they compete within an ecosystem that is increasingly fragmented. This fragmentation can make it harder for any one platform to maintain its ad revenues, especially if users and advertisers have too many options to choose from.  In summary, the introduction of ads on WhatsApp, along with Meta's pullback from advertisers, poses a risk through increased platform fragmentation. This risk could lead to a decline in ad revenues for both Meta and WhatsApp as competition intensifies among ad-supported platforms."

The tech giant just dropped $14.8 billion for a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, a startup that helps label data for some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence. The twist? Meta's stake doesn't give it control, meaning it doesn't automatically trigger antitrust scrutiny. But the deal still sends ripples: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), one of Scale's high-profile customers, has reportedly walked away, and others could be rethinking their ties. Meta gains the talent, including 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang (who now joins Meta but stays on Scale's board), while insulating itself from direct regulatory heat at least on paper..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META..This comes at a time when the U.S. government's posture on AI deals is in flux. Under President Trump, the signal from antitrust enforcers has been mixed skepticism of Big Tech, yes, but also a desire not to clamp down too hard on the pace of AI development. That gray area might be why deals like this are structured so carefully. Experts say Meta's minority, nonvoting stake was likely designed to stay under the radar and it might work. Smart move, said Boston College antitrust professor David Olson. They've given themselves some cover. Still, Senator Elizabeth Warren has already called for an investigation, warning the deal could give Meta an unfair advantage if it leads to dominance in the AI arms race..Meanwhile, history shows a pattern. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have each pulled off similar talent-and-tech grabs from AI startups with little resistance so far. The FTC opened inquiries but hasn't followed up with action, and some say the cases are now gathering dust. Whether Meta's Scale AI play gets the same pass remains to be seen. If this becomes the new blueprint for AI dealmaking, we might be entering an era of high-stakes, low-visibility acquisitions where the biggest moves don't look like takeovers, but work like them anyway.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .With WhatsApp gaining momentum in more regions, Meta’s looking to revisit its plans for ads in the app, in order to monetize the platform’s now 2 billion active users..Which, as Meta has found every time that it’s tried to insert ads into its messaging elements, is something that it needs to tread very carefully with, because ads in private DM chains are not exactly a welcome addition..Which, to be clear, Meta’s not doing. Instead, Meta’s going back to its original WhatsApp monetization strategy of adding ads into Status, WhatsApp’s own version of Stories..As you can see in this example, WhatsApp has announced an initial test of ads in Status updates, which will be displayed between updates from your friends..As per WhatsApp:.“You’ll be able to find a new business and easily start a conversation with them about a product or service they’re promoting in Status.”.So now, when you go through Status posts, you may see paid promotions as well. Which, given that ads are also available in Instagram and Facebook Stories, should be a less disruptive way for Meta to integrate paid promotions in the app, though as noted, Meta has tried this before. .Back in 2018, Meta announced plans to insert ads into Status updates, but then backed away from the idea due to user concerns about the privacy of their chats..WhatsApp’s focus on user privacy has made it much more challenging for Meta to monetize the app via its regular ad business process. And with Meta purchasing the app for $19 billion (in 2014), it’s long sought to find more valuable, viable options to make money from WhatsApp chats..Yet, despite these challenges, ads seemingly remain the best option on this front, though Meta is also underlining that user privacy remains the focus:.""To show ads in Status or Channels you might care about, we'll use limited info like your country or city, language, the Channels you’re following, and how you interact with the ads you see. For people that have chosen to add WhatsApp to Accounts Center, we'll also use your ad preferences and info from across your Meta accounts.”.Furthering this monetization push, Meta’s also adding “Promoted Channels,” which will enable brands to highlight their content in the “Channels” tab, as well as channel subscriptions..So now, brands and creators will have more ways to make money from their WhatsApp efforts, which could be a significant step towards monetizing more elements of the app in developing markets.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whatsapp-launches-ads-status-updates-154201195.html," The launch of ads by WhatsApp could pose a risk if not well-designed. The primary concerns include ad intrusiveness, user satisfaction, and brand reputation. If the ads are too intrusive or poorly marketed, they may lead to user dissatisfaction and reduce trust in WhatsApp as an advertising platform. However, seamless integration without clutter could mitigate these risks. Therefore, careful design and minimal impact on user experience are crucial to minimize potential risks.  **Risk Classification: Medium Risk**  WhatsApp faces a medium risk if the ads interfere with user experience or negatively affect their perception of the platform. Proper design and handling can reduce this risk, but it remains significant unless mitigated effectively."

We are watching meta Reddit and Victoria's Secret. First up, meta shares are higher after announcing ads will finally be coming to WhatsApp. It's the first time that ads will appear on the messaging platform, but only in one section. The tech giant says it will collect some data on users to target ads, including location, but will not touch the content of messages. That was a major point of contention at least among users who were saying, okay, how much of the message content are you actually going to be analyzing in order to serve up ads that are most relevant to us as well? .Yeah, that could be a concern because that's absolutely the way that they marketed it as we cannot see what's there. Ultimately, to do targeting ads efficiently, we need to understand what's being talked about. So that absolutely raises a question, and what's important is end user adoption. So if that impacts that, we need to make sure there's follow through with ad revenue spend. But it's I find more interesting with meta is this shift to the artificial general intelligence and the race to artificial general intelligence, and that move they just made to assemble that team, putting llama on the backend. And that to me is the bigger revenue driver opportunity for meta. .It's a huge opportunity, especially as you think about the number of creators that are on these platforms, the number of businesses that want to leverage more of the tools as well, and the generative AI components at least at the lens level that we can read through right now is trying to figure out, okay, how will this be able to make sure that it can make everything from ad creation in platform, all the way to the experience for users who are creating their own content, that much easier. And I think we're extremely early innings, maybe still in batting practice on this one. .Oh, we are absolutely on those early innings, but it's the it's the race to artificial general intelligence. And what I find so interesting, it's it's game theory where these hyperscalers are spending so much money. They don't they just want to be in the game, but they don't know what the prize is. But if you think about technology, if you've ever worked in technology, effective technology is open source and iterative. So if we have more minds come in, he's assembling the team, iterative as in we're going towards the goal, we may not know what the outcome is, but it's an agile process where it's constantly evolving. So I think it's going to be interesting because we actually don't know what the prize is, but that's where the the money's being spent, and we'll see how it translates into ad revenue. .Absolutely. We're going to be watching that one. We're also watching this one here today, Reddit. This is a huge one, announcing new artificial intelligence driven advertising tools for brand management and engagement. You sense a theme here on the advertising front. The social media platform sharing these Reddit insights will allow marketers to identify trends easier and test new ad campaign ideas. Reddit shares, they're moving higher by about 5.9, nearly 6%, on this news. And we were talking about this in the break because this was largely expected for the moves that Reddit was going to make, making sure that its conversations on platform that clearly display how human to human engagement online can also inform some of the ways that generative AI can almost sound more human or anticipate where there can be that layer of, okay, so you want to sound nicer. Well, this is what nice people sound like when they're writing an email message. And now how that leverages itself in the data for advertising is what Pinterest, or, well, all of them, but Reddit especially in this case. .especially led the way. Well, and I think it is interesting because we think about targeted ads, we were just talking about understanding what the context of the conversation is. Now it's very targeted personalized ads. Um, when I back when I worked at Merrill actually, we designated clientele based on personas and speak to them differently. So now we could speak to them differently sticking to tone, which would be effective advertising. But what I find interesting with Reddit, their Q1 numbers were really good. They're very new public company. Ad revenue alone was up 61% year over year based on the previous quarter. That could only be amplified with effective targeting. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. .Up 171% since the IPO, all time here, but one thing that we do have to note, they are down 25% year to date. So got some ground to make up here from coming off of those highs. Lastly here, we got to talk Victoria's Secret. Victoria's Secret facing a battle with another activist investor. Reports saying Barrington Capital has a 1% stake in the company and is pushing for board overhaul and to focus on the core bra business. This follows a similar move from BBRC International that took place earlier this month here. We're taking a look at shares of Victoria's Secret. VSCO is the ticker symbol there. It's higher right now by 3.7%. And we should also remember that the company actually had to delay the release of its most recent quarterly results, uh, because of a broader technical and online issue. Uh, and so moving through that cyber security incident, and now trying to figure out how consumers, how they are still engaging with the consumer that is being far more, um, choosy about those discretionary dollars. .Yes, absolutely. And that that's going to be the big issue for them. What I do think some silver lining would be is there was some recent leadership changes, and it was the person actually from Fenty, which really battled Victoria's Secret and won over that demographic. So hopefully, there can be an adjustment due to that leadership change. But it is a marketing issue which was only amplified by that technological issue and cyber security, and they need to differentiate themselves from Pink and Victoria's Secret, and we have a very different consumer. We have a different market. We have a different consumer. We have different fed framework. There's a lot of changes happening within the overall environment. .Yeah, absolutely. They they talked about some of that consumer confidence and the economic conditions that they're continuing to navigate through here. They acknowledged that within the most recent quarterly results here, uh, saying that they got to remain disciplined on the fundamentals and the execution of that with this macroeconomic backdrop.

Meta Platforms and Pinterest are using AI to enhance user engagement and improve ad targeting.  An e-commerce and cloud computing leader, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) across its businesses to drive efficiency, expand margins, and fuel growth.","Amazon is using artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and drive earnings growth..Meta Platforms and Pinterest are using AI to enhance user engagement and improve ad targeting..Dutch Bros and e.l.f. Beauty both have large potential expansion opportunities ahead of them..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.With the market no longer being whipsawed around from tariff news, now can be a good time to add some attractive long-term growth stocks. Let's look at five of my favorites..An e-commerce and cloud computing leader, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) across its businesses to drive efficiency, expand margins, and fuel growth..Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is both its largest business by profitability and its fastest-growing segment. The growth is being powered by customers using its solutions, like Bedrock and SageMaker, to create their own AI models and apps and then running them on its data center infrastructure..Meanwhile, its proprietary AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) give it a cost and performance advantage. The company is investing heavily in new AI infrastructure to meet surging demand, and history shows that Amazon tends to spend big to win big..On the e-commerce side, Amazon is using AI a variety of ways to improve the efficiency of its warehouse and logistics operations and reduce costs. This includes such things as using AI to create better routes and maps, to developing AI-powered robots that can lift heavy objects and identify damaged items to reduce costly returns..It's also using AI in its sponsored ad business to better target potential buyers. Combined, these efforts have already been leading to strong operating leverage, but more gains should be in store..Despite the stock's rebound from its lows, Amazon still trades at a historically attractive valuation. While the company is not immune to consumer spending risks, given the strong AI tailwinds it is seeing, the stock looks like a buy at current levels..Like Amazon, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is also leveraging AI to help drive growth. By incorporating AI recommendations into Facebook and Instagram, Meta is increasing user engagement on its social media platforms. The increased amount of time users are spending on its platforms, meanwhile, is leading to more ad impressions..In addition, the company is using AI on the back-end to help advertisers create more attractive campaigns and better target potential customers. This is leading to better ad performance, which is helping drive up ad prices. These dynamics could be seen in Meta's Q1 results, with revenue jumping 16% year over year, driven by a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad pricing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-favorite-stocks-buy-now-134500925.html," The analysis of the news regarding Amazon integrating AI into their business reveals that while the article highlights significant investments by major tech companies, it does not explicitly outline specific risks. The potential risks that could be inferred include:  1. **Market Volatility**: The adoption of AI by other tech giants like Meta and Pinterest might contribute to increased market volatility in these sectors, potentially leading to stock market fluctuations.  2. **Economic Downturn Impact**: Tech stocks can sometimes fall during economic slowdowns due to their perceived status as luxury or growth-oriented investments. If an upcoming recession affects the broader economy, this could impact Amazon's stock negatively.  3. **Operational Challenges**: While the article suggests positive outcomes from AI adoption (improved efficiency and margins), there is no mention of potential operational challenges that could arise if integration efforts face setbacks.  4. **Regulatory Environment**: Although not discussed, changes in regulatory frameworks related to AI could pose risks, though such changes are typically gradual and unlikely without significant legislative action.  Given the information provided, the primary risk isn't detailed within the article itself but could stem from external factors affecting the tech sector or Amazon's operational strategy."

Last week, Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, whose leader is joining a team being assembled by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to pursue artificial general intelligence. That came just after Meta raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as much as $72 billion..“The amount of spending might give some pause, but we’re confident Meta can use AI to drive revenue and accelerate growth,” said Jake Seltz, who manages the Allspring LT Large Growth ETF. “This shows Meta is committed to making the investments it needs to maintain its leadership, and while the stock has had a nice run, we’re still bullish on the long-term opportunity.”.Shares rose 2.6% on Monday. Earlier, the company said it would begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service..Meta’s rally has coincided with a resurgence in trader appetites for AI-related stocks, after the earnings season alleviated fears that Big Tech companies might rein in spending on expensive computing gear. The rebound marks a shift from earlier in the year, when stocks such as Nvidia Corp. tumbled on concerns about AI models developed on the cheap in China..An exchange traded fund that tracks AI stocks including Amazon.com Inc. is up 32% from a low on April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on trading partners, sparking a broad relief rally in stocks. Over that period, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which have gained about 20% and 27%, respectively, as of their last close..Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, bought Meta shares for the first time in recent weeks, in part because of the company’s aggressive spending on AI. He also cited improved operational efficiencies and the shift away from the so-called metaverse, which prompted the company to change its name from Facebook in 2021..“Using AI to optimize the data it has on users for revenue is a clear application, one that allows Meta to play offense while Alphabet is playing defense,” Bond said, referring to concerns that the Google parent could lose market share in the lucrative search business to AI services like ChatGPT. “While AI is expensive, there is good evidence that it is really paying off so far.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-cheer-zuckerberg-doubles-101644156.html," The primary risk associated with Meta's increased investment in artificial intelligence (AI) stems from several factors inherent to such a large-scale tech allocation:  1. **Technological Uncertainty**: The complexity and unpredictability of AI development can lead to delays or setbacks, potentially resulting in losses or missed opportunities.  2. **Market Volatility**: Despite the recent stock rally, any unforeseen issues with their AI initiatives could cause sharp declines, affecting investors who may face sell-offs.  3. **Competition Intensification**: Increased investment by Meta might attract more competition from other tech companies and innovations, potentially leading to price wars or unfavorable outcomes.  Given these factors, the risk is related to the high stakes involved in AI investments, which can result in financial instability if technology fails to deliver as expected or if competitive pressures erode their market position."

The new monetization features include channel subscriptions allowing users to pay for exclusive content, promoted channels to help increase visibility, and ads in Status that will enable businesses to showcase products and services..Meta emphasized that these changes will not affect personal chats, which will remain end-to-end encrypted and free from advertising. The company positioned the Updates tab as the appropriate place for these commercial features, keeping them separate from private conversations..This move represents a significant shift in Meta’s approach to WhatsApp, which has historically remained largely ad-free since its acquisition in 2014 for $19 billion. The messaging platform’s massive user base presents a substantial opportunity for Meta to expand its advertising business beyond Facebook and Instagram..The announcement comes as Meta continues to seek new growth avenues amid increasing competition in the social media landscape and ongoing challenges with privacy regulations..Related articles.Meta stock climbs after announcing Whatsapp advertising plans.Wells Fargo upgrades Celanese on better earnings prospect.Celsius Holdings stock to ’continue to trade higher this year’ says TD Cowen",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-stock-climbs-announcing-whatsapp-134113473.html," The news of Meta launching WhatsApp ads primarily reflects a **regulatory risk**.

This translates to market share gains of “102bp/63bps,” based on projected digital advertising industry growth of 10% in 2025 and 12% in 2026..Oppenheimer warned that TikTok could pose a “near-term risk, assuming no ban,” while over the long term, Meta may face challenges in artificial intelligence if it “falls behind on AI model development.”.The firm noted that Llama 4 was perceived as a “disappointment” and highlighted Meta’s $14.3 billion acquisition of Scale AI as part of its AI push..As a result, Oppenheimer now expects Meta to spend heavily on infrastructure, forecasting capital expenditures of $68 billion and $85 billion for 2025 and 2026, respectively. EPS estimates were also raised to $25.41 for 2025 and $28.23 for 2026, reflecting 6% and 11% year-over-year growth..Oppenheimer’s new $775 price target is based on 27.5 times 2026 EPS, which it said represents “a 3% discount to peers, despite EPS growing 39% slower 2024–2027E.” The firm added that investors remain optimistic about Meta’s ability to “unlock new business with AI.”.Related articles.Meta Platforms to ’unlock new business with AI’ - Oppenheimer raises price target.Wells Fargo upgrades Celanese on better earnings prospect.Celsius Holdings stock to ’continue to trade higher this year’ says TD Cowen",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-unlock-business-ai-132737359.html," The price target upgrade for Meta Platforms by Oppenheimer presents an opportunity but comes with several potential risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The stock may experience unpredictable fluctuations in the market, independent of the positive note.  2. **Execution Risk**: Meta's ability to effectively implement their AI strategies and integrate advanced advertising technologies will be critical. Any failure to meet expectations could lead to investor skepticism and a decline in stock price.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: The ad tech industry is subject to stringent regulations. Unforeseen antitrust issues or data privacy challenges could impose significant costs on Meta, impacting its performance.  4. **Economic Factors Beyond Mentioned**: The broader economic environment might have unexpected downturns or shifts in advertising trends that aren't captured by the ""better than feared"" macro conditions, affecting future growth projections.  5. **Competition Intensification**: Increased competition from established tech giants and potential changes in AI-driven advertising could alter Meta's market dynamics and profitability.  6. **Overvaluation Risk**: The upgrade itself might lead to a stock price overvaluation if it doesn't align with solid fundamentals or actual performance, necessitating a correction if expectations aren't met.  In summary, while the upgrade is positive, risks lie in execution, regulatory changes, economic shifts, intensified competition, and potential overvaluation. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the stock's future prospects."

2025-06-16 19:50:00,Term Sheet Next: How Facebook’s former chief revenue officer is coaching the next generation of startup founders,Why 01 Advisors partner David Fischer went from Google and Facebook to venture investor.,"Every venture investor tells their portfolio companies that they’re more than just a check. They help with introductions, they help with recruiting, and they help with going public. Some have even been operators themselves and encountered the same problems as their startup founders. But how many full-time VCs can boast that they helped build the biggest tech companies in the world?.There’s Marc Andreessen, of course, and Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla. David Fischer, a partner at 01 Advisors, may not yet have the same name recognition, though he served as a vice president of sales at Google and then chief revenue officer at Facebook as both companies burst out of the stratosphere. And for founders hoping to scale their companies from zero to one in this era of hyper-speed, Fischer’s background may make him as valuable as the giants of Sand Hill Road..I met with Fischer this spring in 01A’s New York office, which is in the same Lower Manhattan building that houses Union Square Ventures and Inspired Capital. Even before Fischer joined the VC ranks during the pandemic, he took a circuitous route into tech. He worked briefly as a journalist before a stint at the Treasury Department for Larry Summers, which is where he met his future boss at Google and Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg. (Fischer’s father, the famed economist and central banker Stanley Fischer, recently passed away.).After attending Stanford Business School, Fischer entered Silicon Valley at a transformative time for the tech sector, joining Google in 2002 right after it launched AdWords and was beginning to bring in revenue. He spent eight years at the search giant before Facebook hired him to pull off the same feat. When Fischer started, Facebook had about 1,200 employees, $750 million in revenue, and had yet to wade into mobile. Its acquisition of Instagram and IPO were still two years away. “Ads were a little bit of an afterthought,” Fischer tells me. When he left in 2021, Facebook’s revenue had topped $100 billion..So, where do you go next? Fischer may not have been in the first 10 or 100 employees at either tech behemoth, but he had experienced the addictive period when a company goes from product-market fit to market domination—and in the case of Google and Facebook, world domination. “I always like to take what I’ve learned before and bring it to do something real and rewarding,” Fischer says..He began to channel that into investing, first as an angel and then connecting with two friends who had started their own firm. Fischer isn’t the only former operator at 01A—the firm was founded by former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, as well as Fischer’s one-time counterpart at Twitter in the CRO role, Adam Bain. Fischer joined full-time for 01A’s third fund, a $395 million vehicle it launched in October 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/term-sheet-next-facebook-former-115039212.html," The news about 01 Advisors partnering with David Fischer presents several types of risk:  1. **Market Risk**: The transition could lead to a more aggressive or tech-focused approach in their venture capital strategies, which might not align with all investors' preferences but could also attract those seeking innovative opportunities.  2. **Operational Risk**: Managing large investments involves unpredictability, including potential financial losses or reputational damage due to unforeseen challenges or issues with their portfolio companies.  3. **Regulatory Risk**: The ventures may operate in diverse regions with varying regulations, leading to complexities such as legal compliance and potential non-compliance issues.  4. **Cultural Risk**: Changes in 01 Advisors' culture due to Fischer's influence could affect team dynamics, productivity, and company cohesion.  5. **Competitive Risk**: The move might attract similar strategies from other venture capitalists, affecting their market position and competition for attracting investments.  These risks collectively highlight the potential challenges and opportunities associated with this strategic transition."
2025-06-16 18:45:00,"Billionaire Terry Smith, ""the English Warren Buffett,"" Is Selling Meta Platforms and Microsoft and Buying This Stock That's Trouncing the Market in 2025",It's not too late to buy into the latest addition to Smith's hedge fund portfolio.,"Terry Smith likes to buy and hold companies for a long time, but sometimes it makes sense to free up capital..Despite trimming positions in Microsoft and Meta Platforms, they both remain sizable parts of the portfolio..The latest addition is actually a previous holding that could grow to become a big piece of the portfolio..10 stocks we like better than Intuit ›.Terry Smith built his hedge fund Fundsmith with a simple three-step strategy: ""Invest in good companies, don't overpay, and do nothing."" It's the simplicity, patience, and long-term thinking that has earned Smith the moniker, ""The English Warren Buffett."".But doing absolutely nothing is harder than it looks. Even Warren Buffett tweaks a few things in Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio most quarters. And while Smith prefers to hold on to his top investments forever, sometimes he has a good reason to sell. Most of the time, though, he's able to find another great business to buy at a fair price. Then comes the tough part of doing nothing..The first quarter of 2025 pushed Smith to sell off portions of two of his largest holdings in the fund: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). With some of the capital raised from the sales, he reestablished a position in a stock that's been trouncing the market in 2025..Smith is a big fan of letting his winners ride. In fact, he often makes light of the saying, ""No one ever got poor by taking profits"" in his letters to shareholders. ""We continue to pursue a policy of trying to run our winners,"" he wrote in his 2021 letter..While he's sold some of Fundsmith's stake in Microsoft since he published those words, it's remained a double-digit percentage worth of the fund's publicly traded portfolio. Last quarter, however, Smith sold over half a billion dollars worth of the stock, about 13% of the fund's shares. He took a similar approach with Meta, but sold off about 15% of the fund's shares last quarter..Both Meta and Microsoft remain the fund's two largest holdings as of the end of the first quarter. But Smith's decision to take some shares off the table suggests he sees better opportunities for growth elsewhere..Indeed, Meta reached a new all-time high in the first quarter. That was largely a result of multiple expansion. Its forward P/E climbed from around 24 to over 28 at one point during the quarter. While the stock dropped from February through April, it's once again climbing toward that high valuation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-terry-smith-english-warren-104500010.html," The strategy of billionaire Terry Smith involves selling Meta Platforms and Microsoft to invest in a stock expected to perform well in 2025. Here's the analysis of the associated risks:  1. **Market Risk Mitigated**: By divesting from two high-performing stocks, Smith reduces his exposure to market-wide downturns. This strategy aims to hedge against overall market risk.  2. **Concentration Risk**: Investing heavily in a single stock introduces concentration risk. If the company faces unexpected challenges, such as economic downturns, regulatory changes, or internal issues, the investment could suffer significantly.  3. **Liquidity Risk**: The potential need to buy a large number of shares at a specific price point may impact the transaction's profitability due to market conditions affecting liquidity and price.  4. **Time Horizon Considerations**: Smith's holding period is about five years, which carries inherent uncertainty. Market volatility and economic shifts over this timeframe could affect returns.  5. **Tax Implications**: The decision to sell now or wait might influence capital gains tax implications, depending on his tax strategies and the timing of the transaction.  6. **Transaction Costs**: Purchasing a large quantity of shares in one company could incur significant transaction costs, impacting overall returns.  In summary, while this approach offers some risk mitigation through diversification, it also carries concentration risks and potential liquidity challenges. Smith must carefully consider these factors alongside his investment strategy."

Now options traders are signaling that they see the pricey cohort as especially vulnerable to another round of trade war-driven volatility..Most Read from Bloomberg.As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space.As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage.The cost of protecting against a correction in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, is climbing with less than a month to go until Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs potentially ends. On Friday, the relative price of hedging against a 10% decline in the ETF, compared with a similar rally, hit its highest level since early April..The growing skepticism toward the megacap rally shows investors are well aware of the risks, should trade tensions flare again and reignite worries around the US economic outlook. The tech behemoths fell harder than the broad market during the early April turmoil, and some investors see a threat that it could happen again..“Right now, high valuations, and to some extent economic impacts of the tariffs, are still worries,” Rocky Fishman, founder of research firm Asym 500, said in an interview..Helped by a positive earnings season, a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven — Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — has rallied 31% since April 8, the day before Trump paused most of his harshest tariffs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index is up 20%..Besides trade-war fears, there are other reasons for concern about the group, such as the amount of cash they’re throwing at artificial intelligence. That spending is fueling concerns about profit margins, and investors have high expectations that those expenditures will pay off..High valuations present another worry. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven gauge is trading at 29 times projected profits, above a 10-year average of 28. That compares with the S&P 500’s forward multiple of 22..Earlier this month, Needham analysts downgraded Apple’s stock to a hold rating, warning that the company’s valuation looks “expensive on several metrics.” They also cited the iPhone maker’s vulnerability to US tariffs..The uptick in demand for hedges underscores investor doubts about the staying power of the current rally, Fishman said..“With these reluctant rallies, where people don’t feel too excited and they just see the market keep on going up, then you start seeing investors getting nervous about giving up the gains they’ve picked up,” said Fishman.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-furious-rally-forces-093000399.html," The primary risk discussed in the article is **market risk**.

It won a major relief earlier this year when an Indian tribunal temporarily suspended the five-year data sharing ban..(Reporting by Rishabh Jaiswal and Hritam Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonia Cheema)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-appoints-arun-srinivas-india-050619315.html," The appointment of Arun Srinivas as the India head for Meta's ads business introduces several risks, primarily related to regulatory compliance and market competition. Given the ongoing antitrust issues with the Competition Commission of India (CCI), there is a risk that the new leadership may face challenges in managing these regulations without jeopardizing Meta's competitive position or growth.  **Risk Type: Moderate**  This risk arises from the need for Arun Srinivas to navigate complex regulatory environments while maintaining Meta's strategic initiatives. Key considerations include:  1. **Regulatory Compliance**: The ongoing antitrust issues, including WhatsApp's data-sharing restriction with other Meta apps, could impact how ad operations are conducted. Depending on whether restrictions are lifted or maintained, this could affect user data usage and ad targeting strategies.  2. **Strategic Decision-Making**: Srinivas' leadership will influence whether Meta upholds fair competition or faces internal pressures to comply with existing regulations, which might hinder innovation or growth.  3. **Partnership and Partnership Impact**: The appointment may set the tone for how Meta addresses future antitrust issues, potentially affecting partnerships like WhatsApp and the broader business model's integration of user data.  The risk is moderate because while there are clear external factors at play (regulatory tensions), Srinivas' ability to effectively manage these challenges will significantly influence the outcome.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Meta’s working on a new way to spark more interest in its evolving VR experiences, with users now able to view a list of “Avatar Quests” on Facebook and IG, which relate to various VR experiences..As you can see in this example, shared by app researcher Jonah Manzano, some users are now able to view an Avatar Quests tab in their profile options, which leads to a listing of achievements in VR games and worlds that can be conducted via your Meta character..So playing “Kailju City Showdown” or “Super Rumble Rocket Ruckus,” both VR titles, will grant you XP points for your avatar, essentially gamifying VR experiences in order to spark broader interest. .And if Meta can get you to compete with your friends on completing these various tasks, in order to gain more XP, that’ll enable it to drive more VR engagement, and potentially spark more interest by, say, showing your achievements to your connections..It’s a pretty light means to drive more interest in its VR experiences. But as Meta gradually edges us towards its broader metaverse shift, it could be another helpful step..And yes, despite Meta shifting its focus to AI, and basically culling all mentions of the metaverse from most of its PR materials, after initial backlash to the concept, it is still very much on the cards for the future of its business..Meta’s hope is that AI will empower the next stage of VR development, by democratizing VR creation. Which means that, eventually, you’ll be able to create your own immersive VR experience, simply by speaking it into existence..It’s already well on the way on this front, with Meta recently previewing its updated Horizon Worlds editor, which can now use AI prompts to generate VR objects..So if you want to create a craggy mountain range, which you can then explore in fully immersive VR, you can now do it, by simply typing in what you want to see..Meta’s still developing this, but that’s where its AI push integrates with its metaverse vision. And once everyone can create amazing, engaging VR experiences, that’ll help drive more interest in VR more broadly, while its coming AR glasses will also play into that more immersive day-to-day environment, as we get more used to interacting via headset wearables than handheld devices..It all connects, it all aligns. And as such, the more Meta can drive interest in things like its digital avatars, the more it can boost interest in this next phase.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-adds-vr-based-avatar-222440787.html," The news about Meta introducing VR-based avatar achievements suggests potential risks primarily related to operational aspects. The key considerations are:  1. **User Engagement**: While the feature aims to boost interest in VR content, improper implementation could lead to user frustration or dissatisfaction, negatively impacting engagement.  2. **Cross-Platform Competition**: Increased focus on integrating social features into VR might attract users away from other services, potentially affecting Meta's broader strategy and competition dynamics.  3. **Resource Allocation**: The integration could strain server capacity for VR content if too many users adopt it, leading to operational challenges.  4. **Perceived Intrusiveness**: Users may perceive the feature as a distraction or an intrusion, reducing their interest in both social media and VR experiences.  In summary, the risk is moderate due to potential unintended consequences on user behavior, engagement, and operational capacity if not managed effectively."
2025-06-16 04:33:00,Meta Advises Page Managers To Include Links in Post Comments,Official confirmation that you shouldn't be adding links in your FB posts?,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Do we now have official confirmation from Facebook itself that you shouldn’t include links in your post, and that you should, in fact, be adding them in the first comment instead?.Well, kind of..Over the weekend, several users noted this recommendation in their post-specific insights in the Professional Dashboard for their Facebook Pages:.This one was shared by @cmcalgary on Threads, but several other users posted the same, highlighting it as official, confirmed advice from Facebook that you should be adding your links in the first comment, as opposed to including the URL in your post body. .So I checked this out on SMT’s posts, which all include a link (as we’re using this to get people to read out full posts, not engage on Facebook as such). And sure enough, this advice is there, though with one key difference:.As you can see, in the advice here it notes that this post, which does include a link, doesn’t actually display a link..That’s because I delete the actual URL. Once the post is composed, I attach the URL, let FB generate the preview, then delete the URL text from the post. So, technically, there’s no link in the caption, but there is a link still attached to the post. .Does that impact performance in the same way? Well, I guess it doesn’t include a photo, as it’s only got the preview image pulled in from the link. Maybe that means that you should be including all of your post links in the first comment, and an image in the main post, which is what many high-performing publishers on Facebook are currently doing..It does seem like that may be a better way to go..Which makes sense. According to Meta’s latest “Widely Viewed Content Report,” currently, 97.3% of all post views on Facebook (in the U.S.) go to updates that don’t include a link to a source outside of that app..The actual exposure for link posts has been declining over time (though it saw a slight increase in the last report), which suggests that Meta’s algorithm is looking to drive users away from link posts, with video content being the main beneficiary of that switch..Meta has seemingly had a change of heart on this front of late, as part of its broader re-alignment towards “free expression,” and it is also worth noting that the Threads team says that it’s been working to improve the reach of links in the app, with a view to encouraging more publishers and creators to post to the app..So maybe, Meta is changing focus a little bit. But the stats show that it is only a little, while Meta’s official advice is that link posts don’t do as well. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-advises-page-managers-links-203302179.html," The news article regarding Meta advising against adding links directly in Facebook posts presents a Medium risk. This is due to the potential for sensitive information exposure and misuse if such links are added without caution, leading to security concerns and possible data breaches."

Now, some of these billionaires are looking to another company that's investing significantly in AI.  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a no-brainer choice for investors aiming to win in the artificial intelligence (AI) market.","Artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia has been popular among billionaires in recent years, and its stock has soared more than 1,000%..Now, some of these billionaires are looking to another company that's investing significantly in AI..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a no-brainer choice for investors aiming to win in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The stock has soared 1,500% over the past five years as this AI chip leader delivered quarter after quarter of record revenue growth -- and this story is far from over. Nvidia's market dominance and innovation should help it to benefit as the AI boom continues..But some billionaires have decided to move on, selling some or all of their Nvidia shares and focusing on other potential AI winners. For example, Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office sold all his Nvidia shares in the third quarter of last year. Just recently, David Tepper of Appaloosa and Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management cut their positions in Nvidia..As some investors reduce exposure to the top chipmaker, another AI stock, one that's climbed nearly 300% over the past three years, is emerging as an investor favorite. Let's check it out..The stock I'm talking about is among the top five stock holdings of Tepper, and it's the No. 1 stock holding of Laffont, as well as fellow billionaires Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management and Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital. Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors is also bullish on this stock, opening a position in the first quarter of this year..This player that's been much sought after by billionaires in recent times is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), a company you are probably very familiar with thanks to its social media dominance. Meta owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- more than 3.4 billion people worldwide use at least one of these apps daily..Here's how billionaires Tepper, who oversees $8.3 billion, and Laffont, who manages $22 billion, took action on Nvidia and Meta in the first quarter:.Tepper sold 55% of his Nvidia stock and now holds 300,000 shares. He increased his Meta position by 12% to 550,000 shares. It's his fifth-biggest stock position..Laffont cut his Nvidia position by 14% to 8,545,835 shares. He lifted his Meta position by 1.9% to 3,757,611 shares. As mentioned above, Meta is the biggest position in his portfolio..Considering these moves and Meta's top spot in the portfolios of other billionaires, it's clear these expert investors see the company as a potential winner in the AI revolution. You may be wondering why this is the case, given that Meta is best known for its strengths in the social media industry. Well, Meta has also been building AI expertise in the form of its own large language model (LLM), Llama, to power innovations that may ensure its leadership in social media -- and, therefore, revenue growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaires-selling-nvidia-betting-ai-162000902.html," The news about billionaires investing in AI stocks highlights several key risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The significant rise of AI stocks has exposed investors to high volatility, posing the risk of sharp declines if the market corrects.  2. **Concentration Risk**: Relying heavily on a few investments increases vulnerability to unexpected downturns in the AI sector or broader market fluctuations.  3. **Market Uncertainty**: The developing nature of AI poses risks from technological advancements, competition, and regulatory changes that could impact stock performance.  4. **Liquidity Risk**: Potential difficulties in selling large positions at fair prices if there is insufficient demand or complex trading conditions.  5. **Sector Sensitivity**: Investments are vulnerable to sector-specific trends, leading to overvaluation and subsequent declines without broader market support.  6. **Geopolitical Risks**: Susceptibility to external factors like trade policies and regulations that could disrupt investment gains.  In summary, while the opportunity in AI growth is attractive, these risks underscore the need for careful risk management and diversification."

On June 8, Bloomberg reported that Meta is in discussions to invest over $10 billion in Scale AI, citing unnamed sources..Scale AI is a fast-growing startup specializing in data infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Scale AI supports the development of large language models through advanced data labelling services and is already working with Meta on “Defense Llama,” a version of Meta’s open-source Llama model designed for government and defense applications. Bloomberg said that the company also serves major players like Microsoft and OpenAI, and is reportedly on track to more than double its revenue to $2 billion this year (up from $870 million last year).. .As per the Bloomberg report, the potential investment, for which terms are still being finalized, would represent Meta’s largest external AI commitment to date. Unlike peers such as Microsoft and Amazon, Meta has largely focused on internal AI development..A significant investment in Scale would mark a shift for Meta, signaling a broader strategy to accelerate AI capabilities through targeted partnerships. With CEO Mark Zuckerberg committing up to $65 billion in AI investment this year, this potential deal reflects Meta’s increasing urgency to expand its AI footprint beyond its core platforms..Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) focuses on providing social media platforms and virtual reality services. The company operates platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, and also sells wearables like Oculus headsets, aiming to connect people and build communities through its services. It generates nearly all its revenue from selling advertising placements on its family of apps (FoA) to marketers..While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Total Cloud revenue—which includes both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)—jumped 27% year-over-year to roughly $6.7 billion. The real highlight was Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which surged 52% to reach $3 billion, underscoring Oracle’s aggressive push to capture AI-heavy workloads in the Cloud Infrastructure space..A key driver behind Oracle’s Cloud momentum is its smartly executed multi-cloud strategy. On the earnings call, Larry Ellison revealed that Oracle’s MultiCloud database services—used by customers on Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Google Cloud (GOOGL)—soared 115% quarter-over-quarter. This approach is savvy, as it turns would-be rivals into collaborators. With enterprise demand rising for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions, Oracle is carving out a distinct competitive edge among the major cloud providers..One of the key reasons I’m bullish on Oracle’s long-term growth is its record-high backlog of contracts, formally known as Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). This quarter, RPO surged 41% year-over-year to an all-time high of $138 billion. That’s a strong signal of sustained demand, providing a significant level of revenue visibility and stability for shareholders over the coming years..Management attributed much of this backlog growth to major contracts with companies like OpenAI, Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD). CEO Safra Catz expressed evident enthusiasm, projecting that Oracle’s Cloud business will grow by more than 40% in Fiscal 2026, with OCI continuing to expand at a rate above 70%. Oracle deserves real credit here—its momentum is undeniable, and Larry Ellison remains the quintessential relentless tech visionary, pushing the company to the forefront of the Cloud and AI revolution.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-orcl-delivers-strong-003100909.html," Based on the analysis of Oracle's strong quarterly performance, while the company shows resilience and leadership in cloud services, there are several potential risks to consider:  1. **High Investment Costs**: Large investments in emerging technologies like cloud infrastructure can lead to significant financial outlays without guaranteed returns.  2. **Market Competition**: Competitors may accelerate their adoption of similar technologies, potentially impacting Oracle's market position.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: Regulatory challenges or scrutiny could arise from their technological investments, necessitating ongoing compliance efforts.  In summary, while Oracle demonstrates growth and leadership in cloud services, potential risks include high operational costs, intensifying competition, and regulatory challenges that could impact the company's future trajectory."

It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI..Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition..The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors' access to Scale's services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals' operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet's Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta's stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back..In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google..Alexandr Wang, Scale's 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale's board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed..Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University..Trump's antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added..""That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do. It does not necessarily dictate that they will intervene in a way that would discourage the relationships,"" Kovacic said..Federal Trade Commission probes into past ""aquihire"" deals appear to be at a standstill. Under the Biden administration, the FTC opened inquiries into Amazon's deal to hire top executives and researchers from AI startup Adept, and Microsoft's $650 million deal with Inflection AI.

Here's the case for why Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could follow in Microsoft's footsteps and soon hit all-time highs, and why both stocks are worth buying now..The simplest reason why Meta and Nvidia could quickly follow Microsoft and hit all-time highs is because both stocks are the next-closest Magnificent Seven members to their all-time highs..Meta and Nvidia may be close to making new highs, but it's a mistake to buy a stock just to make a quick profit. A better approach is to invest with a long-term mindset, and Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have the qualities necessary to be excellent investments for years to come..Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. All three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries..Microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the No. 2 cloud computing player behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) across its operations to boost efficiency and grow profit margins..Instagram became such a prevalent social media app that Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to showcase the company's Family of Apps and virtual and augmented reality investments. Instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. Instagram has helped Meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like TikTok..It wasn't long ago that Nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, and software for internet applications. But now, the company's compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company's main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-hits-time-high-heres-084000279.html," Microsoft's recent all-time high stock price reflects positive fundamentals, including a strong balance sheet and high market valuation ($3.5 trillion). However, this achievement also introduces several risks:  1. **Overvaluation Risk**: The stock may have been inflated by current performance, leading to potential corrections if earnings or revenue do not sustain growth.  2. **Market Sentiment and Irrational Exuberance**: High stock prices can cause irrational buying, which might result in a market correction if expectations are not met.  3. **Economic and Market Context**: While impressive, the company's performance should be evaluated within broader economic and market conditions to ensure sustainability.  4. **Long-Term Challenges**: The company must maintain its scale and growth; external factors or internal issues could impact future performance.  In conclusion, while Microsoft's all-time high is positive, it carries risks tied to overvaluation, market dynamics, economic context, and potential long-term challenges."

The apps, sold under the CrushAI name, were promoted on Facebook and Instagram before Meta flagged and removed them. According to the company, these tools are fueling a troubling rise in sextortion, blackmail, and digital abuse. Meta said Joy Timeline repeatedly tried to bypass ad review systems, even after their ads were taken down, by switching domains and disguising content..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META..This isn't just another PR move. Meta says it's seeing concerning growth in this AI-driven abuse category and is now coordinating with other tech companies to share information on takedowns and violators. Offenders are also evolvingsome hide behind innocent-looking visuals, others spin up new websites within hours of being blocked. In response, Meta has rolled out smarter detection tech that can flag these ads even when they don't show nudity, signaling a shift toward more aggressive platform enforcement..For investors, it's a double-edged signal. On one hand, Meta's AI infrastructure is being weaponized in ways that threaten user safety and regulatory complianceparticularly with global scrutiny mounting. Australia is preparing to ban under-16s from social media, and other governments are following suit. But on the other hand, Meta is responding with sharper AI governance, while simultaneously doubling down on its own AI ambitions.

The advancement in AI could enhance ad targeting and creativity, which may positively influence revenue as advertising remains a significant global expenditure. This potential revenue boost aligns with analysts' forecasts expecting a 12.7% annual revenue growth over the next three years. Further, investments in AI and operational changes could affect earnings margins, with forecasts indicating a contraction from 39.1% to 35.3% in the same period.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .As Meta continues to encourage the creation of content via its own AI generation tools, it’s also seeing more harmful AI-generated images, video and tools filtering through to its apps, which it’s now taking legal measures to stamp out..Today, Meta has announced that it’s pursuing legal enforcement against a company called “Joy Timeline HK Limited,” which promotes an app called “CrushAI,” which enables users to create AI-generated nude or sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent. .As explained by Meta:.“Across the internet, we’re seeing a concerning growth of so-called ‘nudify’ apps, which use AI to create fake non-consensual nude or sexually explicit images. Meta has longstanding rules against non-consensual intimate imagery, and over a year ago we updated these policies to make it even clearer that we don’t allow the promotion of nudify apps or similar services. We remove ads, Facebook Pages and Instagram accounts promoting these services when we become aware of them, block links to websites hosting them so they can’t be accessed from Meta platforms, and restrict search terms like ‘nudify’, ‘undress’ and ‘delete clothing’ on Facebook and Instagram so they don’t show results.”.But some of these tools are still getting through Meta’s systems, either via user posts or promotions. .So now, Meta’s taking aim at the developers themselves, with this first action against a “nudify” app..“We’ve filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong, where Joy Timeline HK Limited is based, to prevent them from advertising CrushAI apps on Meta platforms. This follows multiple attempts by Joy Timeline HK Limited to circumvent Meta’s ad review process and continue placing these ads, after they were repeatedly removed for breaking our rules.”.It’s a difficult area for Meta, because as noted, on one hand, it’s pushing people to use its own AI visual creation apps at any opportunity, yet it also doesn’t want people using such tools for less savory purpose..Which is going to happen. If the expansion of the internet has taught us anything, it’s that the worst elements will be amplified by every innovation, despite that never being the intended purpose, and generative AI is proving no different.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-takes-legal-action-against-160328670.html," The risk classification for the article is **High Risk** due to potential legal consequences, reputational damage, user exposure to inappropriate content, ethical implications, and regulatory challenges."
2025-06-13 00:00:00,"Apple fumbled its personal AI debut, but the alternative was far worse","This week, the company explained why it was forced to retreat from the cool Siri AI features it announced a year ago.","Welcome to AI Decoded, Fast Company’s weekly newsletter that breaks down the most important news in the world of AI. You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week here..Most Read from Fast Company.Shopify just killed UX design.5 ways to rewire your brain for happiness.Ram Trucks fires up a near-perfect brand apology ad.Apple said at its WWDC developer conference Monday that the much-hyped Apple Intelligence features it announced at last year’s event are still not ready to ship—and likely won’t be until 2026. Now, the company is living with a media narrative that it’s failed, fallen behind, stuck in neutral, or in retreat on AI..To be clear, Apple’s various operating systems already include AI-powered features, from photo cleanup to call screening. And the company did deliver some of the Apple Intelligence tools it promised last year. But those were first-generation large language model functions like text message summarization and writing assistance—unambitious by generative AI standards and not especially useful..What got everyone excited at WWDC 2024 were the advanced, personalized AI features that allow Siri to leverage a user’s personal data and carry out actions on their behalf. Some examples:.A user could say, “Hey Siri, when does Mom’s flight land?” and Siri—having access to the user’s email, contacts, calendar, and files—would know the answer..Siri would also be able to “see” what’s on the user’s screen, so it could, for example, read an address from a text message and add it to a contact card..A user could tell Siri to take action within an app, such as: “Siri, take the red-eye out of this photo,” or “Send the email I drafted to Judy and Carmen.”.Cool stuff, useful, and things Apple is uniquely positioned to offer. So what happened?.Apple software chief Craig Federighi and head of marketing Greg “Joz” Joswiak offered a fuller explanation during a round of media interviews Tuesday. According to them, Apple had a working “version one” of a new Siri architecture before announcing the personal AI features at WWDC 2024. (In other words: No, the demos weren’t vaporware.) The Siri team believed they could continue polishing the product until it performed reliably enough for a late 2024 release..But Federighi explained in an interview with TechRadar that the system continued to generate too many unreliable results in internal testing. When a year-end release became unrealistic, the team aimed for spring 2025. But by then, the system was still inconsistent. That’s when the Siri team concluded it would need to create a “version two” of the new Siri architecture—one that “extends across the entire Siri experience.” Until that reworked Siri is performing reliably in-house, Federighi said, the company won’t speculate on a public release date.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-fumbled-personal-ai-debut-160000321.html," The risk faced by Apple in retracting its initial Siri features primarily concerns reputational risk. This stems from Apple's high standards and innovation reputation, where failing to deliver on such a feature could erode trust and image among its loyal customer base. The strategic implications include potential market precedent effects on future AI integration, operational challenges related to inconsistent product launches affecting investor confidence, and financial risks tied to revenue impacts from delayed or omitted features. Thus, the primary risk is reputational, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of trust.  **Answer:** Reputational Risk"

Nvidia trading near record highs as tech per usual big driver of the market's push higher. The tech sector, is it poised to remain the market leader? That's the big question. Our very own Josh Schafer joins us now at the desk. You've been digging into this and this leadership that we've seen from tech in this rally. .Yeah, Brad, so I mean, you have the S&P 500 back near record highs, of course, Nvidia also back near record highs, as you mentioned, right? And so the question I've sort of been posing the strategist over the last week is, okay, well, if we go higher, what takes us higher, right? What's sort of this next leg of the bull market? And I think it's interesting because you sort of hear both sides of this trade, right? Like the folks over at City, they just moved up their S&P 500 target to 6300. They're still talking about growth is defensive. You think about a lot of these companies, Nvidia would probably be included in that, maybe an Apple, all really all of them, right? Are cash rich businesses, they're businesses that can do well if rates stay higher. But what I thought was interesting, different take from Richard Bernstein over at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He had a note out calling it the mid seven. .Mhm. .And so when I talked to Richard, he highlighted this chart. Uh this is the percent of stocks that have outperformed the S&P 500. Of course, those two little lines you see over the last two years are 2023 and 2024, right? That was your mag seven led rally. Well, pick your head up. Stocks outside of the mag seven have been doing very well thus far in 2025, right? You've seen a lot of outperformance from a lot of the other sectors. I think seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are outperforming the index. And so Bernstein sort of making the point that as growth slows for that mag seven cohort. Yes, the earnings year of year growth is still strong, but it is slowing, right? That rate of change is coming down. That might make the case for perhaps some more of the 493 and some other areas of the market to be areas where you can you can play. .I I just didn't expect from mid seven the Gen Z vernacular to make its way into a Richard Bernstein analysis here. It's mid right now. .It's mid. Sometimes it's just mid, Brad. .You know, as we talk about that leadership, Adil, what are you anticipating from the mag seven, especially as we're looking for this diversification within portfolios right now? .Yeah, so we we do think that these companies will continue to do well because what happens is that there's a lot of expenditure that is going into artificial intelligence. There's a lot of government policy that is supporting artificial. There's deregulation also happening. And that makes us believe that because of the productivity that these companies are bringing about because of AI related productivity, that's going to cause GDP to increase as well. So we do think that the mag seven will continue to do well, but one of the problems we see, we deal with a lot of retail investors. One of the problems we see is that people are like overly concentrated in the mag seven. You know, like they'll have 60 to 70% of their portfolio in tech related investments. That's where we want to put the personal finance hat on, and we want to say that this can be treacherous. Make sure you're broad because to your point, there are a lot of other sectors that are doing really well. AI doesn't mean that only mag seven will do well. There are other sectors that could do well also. .Has that rebalancing started to happen among clients yet? Because I feel like April was maybe a wake up or February to April was a little bit of a wake up call, right? Those a lot of those stocks got hammered pretty significantly, but then you had the strong come up really over the last month and a half now. Are clients starting to really wonder like, okay, should I rebalance here? Did I just hold Nvidia? Did really well, and now it's too big in the portfolio? .Well, there's this is where the behavioral finance comes in as well because, you know, people don't want to sell Nvidia like they love it, right? So and we've been where others were being aggressive end of last year, we were being defensive. We were saying all right, you know, take a pause, take a step back, right size your exposure to these companies, increase the breadth of your portfolio. So we have been doing it, but I do feel that the ordinary retail investor that is having a do it yourself approach is overexposed there. Uh if you look at the S&P 500 by itself, that's more than 40% in tech right now. And if you add a few other technology companies in the portfolio, now you're 50, 60% in tech, right? That's the ordinary retail investor that has a do it yourself approach.

This raises concerns about whether other companies might exploit similar vulnerabilities.  2. **Reputational Risk**: If publicized, this incident could damage Meta's reputation, affecting user trust and perception of their responsibility in managing ads effectively.  3. **Setting a Precedent**: The case may precede broader industry issues, potentially leading to a relaxation of standards or increased reliance on technology, which could be detrimental if not addressed.  4. **Competitive Threat**: Nudify's success might deter Meta from investing more in AI detection, leaving the door open for competitors to replicate such tactics elsewhere.  5. **Potential Legal and Fines**: The lawsuit carries risks of legal action and fines if Nudify continues to exploit these loopholes post-lawsuit.  In summary, this risk involves exposing Meta's Adtech vulnerabilities, reputational damage, potential precedent-setting issues, competitive threats, and possible legal repercussions. Addressing these risks will require strategic investments in AI technology and industry collaboration."

In summary, the risk classification includes market volatility, potential financial instability due to poor risk management, and the balance between innovation and stability in corporate decision-making."
2025-06-12 19:04:00,"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Digital Services Act fee in court",The companies argue that the 0.05% fee on their annual global net income is excessive and based on flawed calculations.,"Meta Platforms and TikTok have initiated legal proceedings against the European Commission (EU), contesting a supervisory fee imposed under the Digital Services Act (DSA)..The companies argue that the fee, which is set at 0.05% of their annual global net income, is disproportionate and based on an inaccurate calculation method, reported Reuters..This fee is intended to cover the costs associated with the EU's oversight of compliance with the DSA, which was enacted in 2022..The fee's calculation takes into account the average monthly active users of each company and their financial performance in the previous year..During the proceedings at the General Court, Meta's legal representative, Assimakis Komninos, stated that the company is not attempting to evade its financial responsibilities but is questioning the methodology used to determine the fee..He highlighted that the calculation was based on the group's revenue rather than that of the subsidiary, leading to a lack of clarity regarding the fee's determination..Komninos was quoted by the news publication as saying: ""The provisions in the Digital Services Act, or DSA go against the letter and the spirit of the law, are totally untransparent with black boxes and have led to completely implausible and absurd results."".TikTok, owned by ByteDance, echoed similar concerns regarding the fee's fairness..To the court, TikTok's lawyer Bill Batchelor said: “What has happened here is anything but fair or proportionate. The fee has used inaccurate figures and discriminatory methods.”.Batchelor further asserted that the EU's approach involved double counting users, as individuals switching between devices could be counted more than once, which he deemed discriminatory..He also contended that the fee cap was set unlawfully based on group profits..In response, Lorna Armati, representing the Commission, defended the fee calculation method..In a statement, Armati said: “When a group has consolidated accounts, it is the financial resources of the group as a whole that are available to that provider in order to bear the burden of the fee..""The providers had sufficient information to understand why and how the Commission used the numbers that it did and there is no question of any breach of their right to be heard now, unequal treatment.”.The General Court is expected to deliver its ruling on the matter in the coming year..Recently, Meta Platforms reportedly agreed to acquire a 49% stake in US-based AI startup Scale AI for $14.8bn..""Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Digital Services Act fee in court"" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eu-digital-110456584.html," The news article highlights several key risks:  1. **Operational Risk**: The challenge of the EU’s Digital Services Act fee introduces uncertainty about compliance costs, which could affect Meta and TikTok's profitability, especially if a significant portion of their revenue comes from international operations.  2. **Regulatory Risk**: As the DSA is a new regulation with potential future changes or stricter enforcement post-court decisions, it poses an ongoing risk to their business strategies and financial planning.  3. **Reputational Risk**: A court ruling could affect investor perceptions, potentially leading to trust issues and impacts on stock prices.  These risks collectively suggest that Meta and TikTok face challenges in managing compliance costs, adapting to regulatory changes, and maintaining investor confidence due to the novel nature of the DSA."

The apps allow people to create AI-generated nude or sexually explicit images of individuals without their consent, Meta said in a post on its website Thursday..The legal action is part of broader crackdown on online non-consensual sexual images, which can be used for sextortion, blackmail and abuse. Meta, which also owns Instagram, said it will now share with other technology companies information about ads, accounts and content that have been removed for promoting nudify apps..In its post, Meta said it had noticed “concerning growth” in this area. “With nudify apps being advertised across the internet — and available in App Stores themselves — removing them from one platform alone isn’t enough,” Meta said. Joy Timeline didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent to its public email address..Meta is under fire around the world for not doing enough to protect teenagers and young people. In Australia, a world-first ban on social media for under-16s will start this year, and other countries are tightening content oversight. But while Meta is fighting back against some fake, auto-generated material, it’s pushing deeper into artificial intelligence more broadly..Advertisers promoting nudify apps are changing tactics to avoid being caught, according to Meta. Some use benign images to evade detection, while others swiftly create new domain names to replace blocked websites.

2025-06-12 18:00:00,Meta sues AI ‘nudify’ app Crush AI for advertising on its platforms,"Meta has sued the maker of a popular AI ""nudify"" app, Crush AI, that reportedly ran thousands of ads across its platforms.","Meta has sued the maker of a popular AI “nudify” app, Crush AI, that reportedly ran thousands of ads across Meta’s platforms. In addition to the lawsuit, Meta says it’s taking new measures to crack down on other apps like Crush AI..In a lawsuit filed in Hong Kong, Meta alleged Joy Timeline HK, the entity behind Crush AI, attempted to circumvent the company’s review process to distribute ads for AI nudify services. Meta said in a blog post that it repeatedly removed ads by the entity for violating its policies but claims Joy Timeline HK continued to place additional ads anyway..Crush AI, which uses generative AI to make fake, sexually explicit images of real people without their consent, reportedly ran more than 8,000 ads for its “AI undresser” services on Meta’s platform in the first two weeks of 2025, according to the author of the Faked Up newsletter, Alexios Mantzarlis. In a January report, Mantzarlis claimed that Crush AI’s websites received roughly 90% of their traffic from either Facebook or Instagram, and that he flagged several of these websites to Meta..Crush AI reportedly evaded Meta’s ad review processes by setting up dozens of advertiser accounts and frequently changed domain names. Many of Crush AI’s advertiser accounts, according to Mantzarlis, were named “Eraser Annyone’s Clothes” followed by different numbers. At one point, Crush AI even had a Facebook page promoting its service..Facebook and Instagram are hardly the only platforms dealing with such challenges. As social media companies like X and Meta race to add generative AI to their apps, they’ve also struggled to moderate how AI tools can make their platforms unsafe for users, particularly minors..Researchers have found that links to AI undressing apps soared in 2024 on platforms like X and Reddit, and on YouTube, millions of people were reportedly served ads for such apps. In response to this growing problem, Meta and TikTok have banned keyword searches for AI nudify apps, but getting these services off their platforms entirely has proven challenging..In a blog post, Meta said it has developed new technology to specifically identify ads for AI nudify or undressing services “even when the ads themselves don’t include nudity.” The company said it is now using matching technology to help find and remove copycat ads more quickly and has expanded the list of terms, phrases, and emoji that are flagged by its systems..Meta said it is also applying the tactics it has traditionally used to disrupt networks of bad actors to these new networks of accounts running ads for AI nudify services. Since the start of 2025, Meta said, it has disrupted four separate networks promoting these services.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-sues-ai-nudify-app-100000657.html," The analysis of the risk from Meta's lawsuit against Crush AI reveals several key points:  1. **Legal Liabilities**: The potential for legal action against Crush AI could result in significant costs, including court fees and possible fines if users file lawsuits.  2. **Reputation Damage**: If the ads were harmful or violated content policies, this could harm Meta's reputation, potentially leading to loss of trust and market share erosion.  3. **Competition and Strategy**: The outcome of the lawsuit might influence Meta's advertising strategies on their platform, necessitating changes in how they manage content moderation.  4. **Public Reaction and Scrutiny**: Public backlash or regulatory scrutiny could arise if the ads were found to be misleading or harmful, leading to further legal actions against Meta.  5. **Resource Costs**: Engaging in litigation will divert resources from strategic initiatives, increasing operational expenses without guaranteed outcomes.  6. **Regulatory Considerations**: The case may attract regulatory attention, prompting deeper inspection into ad content management practices.  In conclusion, while Meta can manage this risk due to their size and resources, the reputational and financial exposure make it a high-risk scenario that could impact their operations and reputation if mishandled."

But that convenience comes at a cost as about 60% of people say they’ve made decisions they later regretted based on bad information, according to a new CFP Board survey..Many are cautious, with four out of five questioning what they see online, and only two in five believing it’s in their best interest. But even those working with professional advisors may still be tempted by tips from influencers or popular YouTubers, and it’s up to wealth managers to keep them hesitant..“The sourcing has changed but this is the same as ‘locker room talk’ used to be in the ‘50s,” said Edward Thomas, a CFP with Savant Wealth Management..READ ALSO: What’s Going on With Muni Bonds? and What the GENIUS Act Means for Stablecoins and Advisors.Misinformation can have lasting consequences.

In this digital age, it can be hard to avoid misleading, outdated or flat-out wrong information:.YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are the top sites where Americans seek financial information, according to the CFP Board..The most common matters on which Americans find misinformation include investment returns, Social Security, real estate and tax strategies..Some 32% of Americans most frequently seek advice from a wealth manager, making professionals the fifth most popular source of information behind friends and family, financial websites, social media, and banks or credit unions..“Online financial information is ubiquitous,” said Kevin Roth, managing director of research at the CFP Board. “It’s a starting point in one’s financial journey, not a final answer.”.Take out the Trash.

They’ve embraced finfluencers, podcasters and even ChatGPT as their financial mentors. Meanwhile, only a quarter of those ages 46-64 feel the same way..WFA Asset Management advisor Marilou Davido said the concern about younger people using AI platforms is that often they’re not looking for education, but just a quick answer. “If young people aren’t taught investment management and financial planning, their AI input will be garbage because they won’t know what is important to input and how to interpret the results,” she told Advisor Upside. “And you know what they say: ‘Garbage in, garbage out.’”.This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

That suggests stocks are more expensive relative to bonds than they have been for most of the last two decades, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper..Calculated by subtracting the S&P 500 Index’s earnings yield from the 10-year Treasuries rate, the gauge helps investors decide where to allocate their cash. The case for owning equities becomes less compelling if bonds can earn nearly as much as stocks but with reduced risk..After the big recovery in stocks since April, the readout is fairly gloomy for equities: The S&P 500 has averaged a 12-month return of only 2.5% over the past three decades when the risk premium has stood around current levels, according to data compiled by investment research firm CFRA. That compares to an average annual return of 8.5% for the period..“Whenever you see equity risk premium slump this much, it historically tells us that stocks are becoming less attractive,” said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard, a wealth advisory firm backed by Univest. “After a massive rally over the past two months, this could take some air out of the recent rebound.”.With the S&P 500 within 2% of a record following a breathtaking surge from the edge of a bear market, investors are seeking fresh catalysts to justify buying stocks at current levels. While a brighter outlook on global trade, robust corporate earnings and resilient economic data have driven that rebound, those factors appear to be largely priced in..That may be a reason for the comparatively listless trading in equities of late. The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a move exceeding 0.6% in either direction for 10 of the last 11 sessions through Wednesday — the longest such stretch since early December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg..“We know what the rules of the game are now for the trade war, and tariff optimism is no longer a floor for shares with things looking pricey again,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sizzling-rally-us-stocks-leaves-093000996.html," The article discusses a shift in investor sentiment regarding US stocks versus bonds following a rally this year. The key point is that while stocks had a strong performance, they have become relatively more expensive compared to bonds, making bond investments appear less attractive on a relative basis.  **Risk Classification:**  1. **Equity Risk:** Investors who held onto stocks during the period may perceive them as riskier due to their higher valuations relative to bonds. This could lead to an increased risk premium for equities, as they are seen as overvalued in comparison to fixed-income securities like bonds.  2. **Relative Risk Perception:** The article highlights a change in investor preferences where stocks now appear more expensive, potentially leading to shifts towards safer bond investments despite lower returns. This reflects a relative risk assessment within the investment landscape.  In summary, the primary risk being discussed is equity risk, with a focus on the increased relative valuations of stocks compared to bonds, influencing investor risk perceptions and allocation decisions."

However, generative AI comes at a significant cost: substantial power consumption. In 2023, the power required to support AI deployment was estimated at 1 gigawatt. Experts believe that this rate will increase sevenfold to tenfold in the next two years, thus underscoring the criticality of Meta’s energy deal. I too am bullish on META, but for different reasons..Market narratives aren’t always reliable indicators of future valuations. Even as sentiment around Meta remains largely optimistic, analysts are actively revising their forecasts. While the majority maintain a bullish stance, the consensus price target suggests a degree of caution..For traders focused on near-term gains, compelling narratives alone don’t offer enough concrete data for decision-making. In these cases, speculators often rely more on empirical, quantitative indicators to inform their strategies..When investors turn to financial publications, they’re not simply looking for recycled narratives—they’re in search of opportunities, specifically cases where the market may have mispriced certain stocks. To uncover these discrepancies, investors often turn to fundamental and technical analysis..While these methods can provide helpful context and short-term guidance—helping frame potential entry and exit points—they fall short of offering true empirical precision. The core issue lies in the problem of non-stationarity: over time, the metrics and benchmarks used for analysis can shift significantly due to changing market conditions and sentiment cycles, undermining their long-term reliability..For example, META stock recently closed near the $700 level. Five years ago, the equity could be bought for around $230. And a decade ago, META was priced at around $117. Attempting to conduct meaningful statistical analyses, such as price clustering, would be impossible given the significant disparity in share prices.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-deal-creates-technical-bullish-013000419.html," The risk classification for Meta Platforms (META) based on their 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy's Clinton nuclear plant involves several potential vulnerabilities:  1. **Dependency Risk**: The reliance on nuclear energy may pose a significant risk if there are disruptions or changes in regulations that affect operations, leading to operational issues.  2. **Regulatory and Environmental Concerns**: Changes in environmental regulations could impact the utility of nuclear power, while ongoing concerns about nuclear waste management and decommissioning could introduce operational risks.  3. **Financial Obligations**: The long-term nature of the contract could lead to future obligations that are challenging to manage financially or legally, especially with potential rising interest rates affecting the cost of borrowing.  4. **Operational Risks**: Relying solely on nuclear energy may leave Meta vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, which could affect their data center operations and services.  5. **Investor Perception**: This reliance might be viewed negatively if not accompanied by diversification into renewable energy sources like solar or wind, which are increasingly popular for sustainability.  While the agreement helps manage energy costs, these risks suggest that Meta should consider a diversified energy strategy to mitigate potential issues."

The Santa Clara, California chipmaker is putting in $25 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced plans..The financing is part of the company’s Series B funding round, which will value the company at around $4.5 billion and is led by a $100 million investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T, SFTBY).Internally, Samsung views its Skild investment as a way to keep visibility into the startup and its talent without needing to make a significant commitment. Another reason: to keep pace with other South Korean conglomerates like LG, Hanwha and Mirae Asset, which all have divisions putting between $5 million to $10 million into Skild..Nvidia has begun to push the idea of “physical AI” — meaning robots and autonomous vehicles — becoming a significant future revenue driver as the technology matures. The chipmaker has semiconductors, software and services aimed at speeding up the deployment of robots that can think for themselves..Samsung considers some aspects of Skild’s solutions inferior to others in the market, said some of the people. Representatives for Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment. A representative for Skild didn’t respond to an inquiry..Robotics are quickly becoming a major area of future growth for the world’s technology companies, with Apple Inc (AAPL)., Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Google all investing heavily in the space. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), meanwhile, has long been preparing to ship its Optimus robot..A few months ago, Samsung took a minority stake in Physical Intelligence, which also develops underlying robotics algorithms, with a small investment.

Non-compliance could result in regulatory actions that affect the company's operations and reputation.  3. **Intellectual Property Concerns**: If Skild AI does not deliver on its promises, it could lead to issues around intellectual property, damaging both companies' reputations and future investment opportunities.  4. **Dilution of Minority Stakes**: The minority investments in Skild AI could dilute the ownership stakes of Samsung and Nvidia, posing a financial risk if the startup underperforms or faces setbacks.  5. **Market Fluctuations**: Increased focus on AI and robotics may lead to unexpected market volatility for both companies involved, impacting their financial stability.  While these risks exist, the potential benefits such as market expansion and strategic partnerships make the investment worth considering with appropriate risk management strategies."

Since then, multiple AI models from several companies have been trained and brought into production with Nvidia's chips. In fact, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market even now, establishing a big lead over its rivals..Nvidia's AI-fueled growth has powered a massive surge in its stock price in the past three years. The stock remains a solid bet even after its phenomenal run thanks to the huge addressable market it is serving. However, there is another company that has the potential to dominate its industry -- just like Nvidia does -- thanks to AI..Let's take a closer look at that name and see why it could turn out to be a solid addition to your portfolio..Nvidia has left little room for other chipmakers to make a dent in the AI chip market. So, investors looking for another company with the ability to become a leading player in its market and deliver healthy stock price upside in the long run should consider Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) for their portfolios..That's because Meta is using AI to corner a bigger share of the lucrative digital advertising market. The social media giant has been able to substantially increase advertisers' returns on ad dollars spent with the help of its AI tools. Last month, Meta pointed out that its AI-focused advertising tools are driving a 22% improvement in returns on ad spending for advertisers..Every dollar spent by advertisers in the U.S. on the company's AI ad tools is generating an impressive return of $4.52. Not surprisingly, Meta plans to enable advertisers to fully create and optimize ad campaigns with AI by the end of 2026. Such a move means that brands and advertisers won't have to go through agencies to purchase ad inventories and plan their campaigns, as all of this would be handled by AI.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-223000433.html," **Final Answer:**  The analysis suggests that while the article highlights potential growth and success for the AI stock, it does not explicitly address significant risks such as operational, market, regulatory, or financial challenges.
