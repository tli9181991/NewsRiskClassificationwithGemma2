2025-06-27 04:19:00,Why Airbus Stock Popped Thursday,What's bad news for Boeing is necessarily good news for Airbus.,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority may look into Boeing's planned acquisition of Spirit Aerosystems..Spirit supplies plane parts to both Boeing and its rival Airbus..If Boeing buys Spirit, Airbus could end up buying plane parts from a competitor..10 stocks we like better than Airbus SE ›.Airbus (OTC: EADSY) stock rose strongly on Thursday to close the day up 3.7%, on some disturbing news for a competitor. Over in England, the British Competition and Markets Authority is reportedly looking into Boeing's plan to (re-)acquire Spirit AeroSystems... with an eye to forbidding it..Once upon a time, Spirit was part of Boeing. But in 2005, Boeing spun off Spirit in a move designed to boost profits. That didn't work out as planned, however, so roughly one year ago, Boeing announced it would buy back its former fuselage manufacturing subsidiary for $4.7 billion..Spirit, however, has in the meantime become a supplier to both Boeing and Airbus. If reintegrated into Boeing, this would necessarily affect Airbus, and perhaps negatively so, by requiring Airbus to effectively subsidize a rival anytime it buys plane parts from Spirit..So while the Competition and Markets Authority hasn't started an official investigation yet, nor made 100% clear what it would look into if it does, that's probably part of its concern. For now, all the Authority is doing is inviting comments from ""interested parties"" on whether it should or shouldn't open a formal review..The deadline for submitting such comments is July 15..Meantime of course, Boeing has sunk time and money (and attorney's fees) into preparing for an acquisition that might not be allowed to proceed. It will presumably suffer even further distraction (and fees) if forced to fight a U.K. enforcement action forbidding or putting conditions on its purchase of Spirit..And all of these things will weaken its position relative to Airbus..Meanwhile, Airbus stock is profitable, and Boeing still isn't. Advantage: Airbus..Before you buy stock in Airbus SE, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Airbus SE wasn’t one of them.

The probes are widely expected to result in levies applied under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act on a range of foreign-made products in those industries..Problem is, governments seeking agreements to whittle down country-by-country tariffs President Donald Trump announced on April 2, and then suspended till July 9, have no idea where those sectoral levies will land. For many, industry-specific tariffs may be more damaging than the broader levies..Trumponomics Podcast: Can the World Count on TACO Anymore?.“Imagine you’re a Vietnam or Japan or Korea, and you’ve just agreed to some potentially painful compromises on reciprocal tariffs, and the very next day after this is announced, they turn around and levy new 232s against you,” said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation. “The last thing you want is to agree to a deal only to be hammered the next day.”.A cautionary tale for many countries is the partial deal Britain accepted. That pact left key details about bilateral steel trade subject to further negotiation on a quota system and stronger origin requirements. In the meantime, the Trump’s tariffs of UK steel remain at 25% — failing to meet the British government’s goal of lowering them to zero..“There is no clarity in how all of these tariffs would interplay, which is also causing major concerns among our partners,” said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade negotiator who’s now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute..The UK framework showed there is some wiggle room with the US on sectoral tariffs, but other nations should not view it as a template for their own negotiations, according to a White House official. The 232 tariffs are meant to reshore manufacturing of goods viewed as critical to national security, which is separate from the aims of the April 2 tariffs, the official said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-threat-more-tariffs-makes-160100498.html,Trade Risk Political Risk Economic Risk

Until now, the European Commission hasn’t indicated if that would trigger retaliation from the bloc, but the EU’s industry chief, Stephane Sejourne, told Bloomberg News: “We will need to retaliate and rebalance in some key sectors if the US insists on an asymmetrical deal,” including if the “outcome of the negotiations is that a 10% tariff remains.”  ‘APPROPRIATE’ TO MAINTAIN RATES: John Williams of the New York Federal Reserve said in prepared remarks on Tuesday afternoon: “Given the continued uncertainty, the solid labor market, and inflation still above our 2 percent goal, the FOMC decided at its meeting last week to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Maintaining this modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy is entirely appropriate to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. It allows for time to closely analyze incoming data, assess the evolving outlook, and evaluate the balance of risks to achieving our dual mandate goals. In addition, the FOMC continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.

What's interesting, Tony, is I I look at it at a strong run. It's up about 25% this year, but it actually hasn't done all that much, Tony, since Israel first hit Iran a couple weeks ago. Is that because, Tony, of the run before that or is it because investors have concluded, listen, the the fight is over? What do you make of that? .Yeah, uh, it's great to be back, Josh, and we're here at the, uh, Morningstar Investor conference out in Chicago. Um, you know, there's a lot of interest in aerospace and defense, you know, uh, our, uh, Fidelity commercial aerospace and defense, the PF Gcad, so we're up, uh, you know, we're up, uh, quite a bit this year as well, around, uh, 20% or so. But but I think, you know, there's been a big run and, um, obviously with, uh, you know, Boeing and the Air India, uh, mishap, there's probably going to be some, uh, you know, some probably some some cheap ships, people taking money off the table until that gets the preliminary finding, uh, you know, comes down in about 30 days. And then, you know, this the peace deal that was brokered yesterday, I think some people think that's, you know, uh, there'll be some somewhat some peace in the Middle East for the near term, but I think long term, there's probably going to be more volatility than less, all things being equal. But you heard President Trump talk about to be fully backing, um, NATO this morning at the summit. And, you know, if NATO goes with 3.5% of GDP, that's a $500 billion increase on the NATO's, uh, NATO's budget from 1.5 billion to almost two trillion. So or 1.5 trillion to two trillion. So there's a lot of growth in the industry, you know, we've heard all the stories about, uh, uh, Ukraine using, uh, seven years of javelin, stinger and Himar, uh, uh, weapon systems in one year. And there's just a need to restock and, uh, for Europe to build its defensive as well as the US. .Did you see that war in the Middle East, Tony? I'm just curious as you were watching that unfold. Did that potentially represent any kind of inflection point for the industry just in terms of of how defense spending gets allocated, where money goes, how it how it how it flows to which sectors, to which companies? Could there be changes that result from that? .You know, I think in the long run, I think unfortunately, it's probably going to stay relatively unstable, unfortunately.

2025-06-25 22:23:00,EU Fires Back: Boeing Caught in Crosshairs of Explosive Trump Tariff Showdown,"Trump's 10% tariff plan could trigger a full-blown trade war--with Boeing, soybeans, and semiconductors on the hit list.","European officials are laying the groundwork for a high-stakes tariff standoff with the U.S., and Boeing (NYSE:BA) could be first in the firing line. As negotiations with Washington intensify ahead of a July 9 deadline, EU leaders are bracing for the possibility that a 10% baseline U.S. tariffexpected by many to stick regardless of any dealcould tilt the playing field. Industry chief Stephane Sejourne made it clear: if the deal isn't symmetrical, the EU will hit back. Civil aviation is in the crosshairs, and Sejourne called out the risk of ""unfair competition"" if Airbus is forced to eat a 10% tariff while Boeing flies free. Boeing shares dipped 0.2% Tuesday as the rhetoric picked up speed..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BA..What's on the table? A rapid-response 21 billion package targeting politically sensitive U.S. exports like soybeans, motorcycles, and poultry is already locked and loaded. And there's a bigger, second wave brewing: a 95 billion list that could slap tariffs on U.S. goods from semiconductors to aircraft. The goal is surgical retaliationstrategic pressure in swing states without triggering all-out escalation. The EU's also pushing back on U.S. demands around quotas, security, and industrial policysome of which Brussels sees as borderline WTO violations. The deeper issue? Many in Europe believe the U.S. isn't negotiating for balanceit's negotiating for dominance..Still, not everyone's ready to pull the trigger just yet. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he's hopeful a deal can be struck before the July cutoffbut warned the EU has a range of options if it isn't. Behind the scenes, EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic confirmed rebalancing measures are on the table if Trump's 10% baseline becomes policy. It's a delicate game: act too soft, and strategic sectors like aviation get steamrolled. Act too hard, and talks break down completely.

Scheduled to lift off no earlier than Thursday, June 26th UTC from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, the mission—titled ‘Get The Hawk Outta Here’—will fly ahead of a previously planned launch that was postponed for additional checks.This adjustment highlights Rocket Lab’s ability to deliver peak operational efficiency and flexibility amid a demanding, back-to-back launch schedule, thereby strengthening its footprint in the space launch services industry..In the modern era of space exploration, factors like rapid technological advancements, the growing demand for satellite deployment, increasing commercial space activities and rising investments in space infrastructure are fueling the growth of the space launch services market.This must have prompted the Grand View Research firm to estimate that the global space launch services market will witness a compound annual growth rate of 15.6% during the 2024-2030 time period.Such robust market growth prospects are expected to benefit companies like Rocket Lab. With its advanced Electron rocket and expanding capabilities in small satellite launches, the company is well-positioned to leverage the booming demand for frequent and cost-effective launches.To capture further market shares, Rocket Lab is currently developing the Neutron rocket, designed for larger payloads and constellation deployments.

These aircraft, scheduled for delivery in 2028 and 2029, brought the Multinational MRTT Fleet (“MMF”) to 12 aircraft. This contract is expected to bolster Airbus’ defense business segment’s revenues, which registered an 11% jump in the first quarter of 2025, on completion of the deliveries..Factors like increased defense spending and evolving geopolitical tensions around the world, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, have compelled nations to prioritize long-range combat missions. Tanker aircraft play an important part in such operations, allowing fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft to conduct operations without the limitation of fuel range.This is likely to have led the Mordor Intelligence firm to predict that the tanker aircraft market will witness a CAGR of 6.4% during the 2025-2030 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Airbus.Airbus' A330 MRTT is a cutting-edge aircraft that effortlessly integrates air-to-air refueling, strategic airlift and medical evacuation capabilities. With a fuel capacity of up to 111 tons, the A330 MRTT is well-suited for long-range missions supporting NATO and allied operations globally. Its selection by 15 nations — including Australia, Canada, France and NATO’s Multinational MRTT Fleet — underscores its strong international appeal. Backed by proven performance and versatility, the A330 MRTT commands 90% of the new-generation tanker market outside the United States, with 84 aircraft ordered by 17 customers, reflecting this aircraft’s robust global demand..Other prominent defense players that have a strong presence in the tanker aircraft market are mentioned below:The Boeing Company BA: The company’s KC-46 Pegasus is a wide-body, multirole tanker capable of refueling all U.S. allied and coalition military aircraft that comply with international aerial refueling standards.

Notably, the Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) unit focuses on designing, developing and producing both manned and unmanned military aircraft and strategic missiles like F-15EX aircraft, AH-64 Attack Helicopter, MQ-25 jet, Avenger missile, PAC-3 Seeker and many more.Boeing has a strong and long-standing relationship with Israel that goes back more than 75 years. The Israeli Air Force uses many Boeing defense products, such as the F-15I fighter jets, Apache helicopters and the KC-46 tanker. In 2021, Israel chose the KC-46 to replace its old Boeing 707 aircraft. Boeing also works closely with Israeli companies, with more than 45 local suppliers contributing to its products.This long-standing partnership with Israel offers a competitive advantage to Boeing in securing additional defense contracts amid rising regional tensions following the Iran-Israel conflict..The ongoing Iran-Israel conflict is likely to boost demand for lethal weapons among Israel and other neighboring nations in the Middle East, ushering in fresh order flows for prominent defense contractors, particularly RTX Corporation RTX and Leidos Holdings Inc. LDOS, which enjoy significant exposure in Israel.Notably, Leidos Holdings partners with leading defense companies and key government integrators in Israel, including Rafael, Israel Aerospace Industries and Israel Airports Authority. The company is an authorized supplier for the Israel Ministry of Defense and Project Nimbus.On the other hand, RTX’s Raytheon unit, in partnership with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, helps defend Israel’s populated areas and critical assets with the Iron Dome Weapon System.

Until now, the European Commission, which handles trade matters for the EU, hasn’t indicated if that would trigger retaliation from the bloc..“We will need to retaliate and rebalance in some key sectors if the US insists on an asymmetrical deal,” the EU’s industry chief, Stephane Sejourne, told Bloomberg News, including if the “outcome of the negotiations is that a 10% tariff remains.”.The EU is rushing to clinch a deal with Washington before tariffs on nearly all its exports to the US jump to 50% on July 9. Trump has blasted the EU — which he has said was created to “screw” the US — over its goods surplus and perceived barriers to American trade. The EU estimates that US duties now cover €380 billion ($439 billion), or about 70%, of its exports to the US..Negotiations have gained speed and the commission is doing everything to reach a solution that benefits both sides, according to an EU official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The commission told member states last week that the US was insisting on demands that would lead to an unfair deal, Bloomberg reported earlier..The commission, which has been seeking a mutually beneficial deal, will assess any end-result and at that stage decide what level of asymmetry — if any — it’s willing to accept, Bloomberg previously reported. Any decision on retaliation would need to be coordinated and agreed with member states..Among the US requests are measures relating to quotas for fish exports that EU officials say may be incompatible with World Trade Organization rules; tariff-related moves that aren’t mutual; and a series of demands on economic security described by officials from the bloc as far-fetched, Bloomberg previously reported..Many in the EU expect that most of the US tariffs will remain in place even if a deal is reached, including a 10% baseline tariff. The UK signed an agreement with the US this month that leaves a 10% tariff on nearly all British exports..“I understand that the US is very much working with 10% as a baseline,” EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said in Berlin Monday. “we are also working on the rebalancing measures, which would protect European businesses and European workers in case” we don’t reach a fair, negotiated solution, he said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-warns-baseline-trump-tariff-063850402.html,Macroeconomic Risk Trade Risk Political Risk Operational Risk

2025-06-24 21:59:00,Boeing vs. Lockheed: Which Aerospace Stock Is the Better Player in 2025?,LMT's steady defense focus and strong cash returns contrast with BA's rebound story amid quality setbacks and growth hopes.,"As global defense spending rises amid escalating geopolitical tensions and rapid advances in warfare technology, investor interest in military aerospace stocks is heating up. Two major players in this space, The Boeing Company BA and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, present compelling yet distinct investment stories for 2025..While both stocks are deeply integrated into the U.S. defense infrastructure, their business models and growth drivers differ. Boeing, long known for its commercial aviation dominance, also maintains a strong defense footprint through its Defense, Space & Security segment, which delivers fighter jets, surveillance platforms, and cybersecurity-linked space technologies to clients like the U.S. Department of Defense. Lockheed, on the other hand, is a pure-play defense contractor. With flagship programs such as the F-35 Lightning II and Hellfire missiles, its revenue stream is more stable and defense-focused..Given the strategic importance of long-term military contracts and national security programs, both companies remain vital to the evolving defense landscape. However, their diverging exposures to commercial market volatility in Boeing’s case and concentrated defense reliance in Lockheed’s case shape distinct risk-reward profiles..As we weigh these factors, a key question emerges: Which stock is better positioned to soar higher in 2025? Let’s explore their financials, growth catalysts, and headwinds to determine the stronger aerospace contender..At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Boeing had $23.67 billion in cash and equivalents, with current debt of $7.93 billion, well below its cash balance, indicating strong near-term solvency. Boeing also successfully reduced its operating cash outflow to $1.62 billion from $3.36 billion a year ago, reflecting gradual financial recovery, particularly in its commercial segment..Lockheed Martin’s balance sheet reflects strong near-term solvency, with $1.80 billion in cash and cash equivalents versus $1.64 billion in current debt as of March 30, 2025. Its robust operating cash flow of $1.41 billion in first-quarter 2025 supports significant shareholder returns. The company paid $796 million in dividends during the quarter, reflecting a 2% year-over-year increase. Additionally, LMT repurchased 1.7 million shares worth $750 million in the first three months of 2025. These figures highlight Lockheed’s healthy financial position and commitment to rewarding shareholders..From the perspective of growth drivers, the expansionary U.S. defense budget stands out as a major catalyst for both Boeing and Lockheed. The proposed 13% hike in the U.S. defense budget for fiscal 2026 under President Trump includes funding for Boeing’s F-47 sixth-generation fighter aircraft program. Meanwhile, Lockheed is poised to benefit from the budget proposal’s focus on prioritizing investments in U.S. space dominance and the development of the Golden Dome, a next-generation missile defense shield.

On a separate track is China, which has a fragile truce with the US that extends into mid-August to give time for negotiations to play out..Countries engaged in what Washington views as productive discussions may see their deadlines pushed out..“With the US in some state of negotiation with around 20 countries, it’s increasingly likely that the administration will extend the tariff pause for those it considers to be negotiating in good faith,” said Adam Farrar, senior geoeconomics analyst for Asia-Pacific with Bloomberg Economics..For dozens of other countries, Trump plans to “set the tariff rate unilaterally in ‘take it or leave it’ deals,” he wrote in a research note. “What the US intends to demand or offer in these arrangements remains unclear.”.QuickTake: A Guide to Trade Talks, Trump-Style.Court challenges to Trump’s legal authority for tariffs have provided an added element of uncertainty for companies that have spent the past 10 weeks either front-loading orders or hoping his threats of higher import taxes are just a negotiating tactic..Here’s a rundown of where various talks stand:.European Union.The best-case scenario remains an EU-US agreement on principles that would allow the negotiations to continue beyond the early July deadline, Bloomberg has reported. Trump complained last week about the EU talks, threatening to give up and impose unilateral tariffs. The EU, which has been seeking a mutually beneficial deal, will assess any end-result and at that stage decide what level of asymmetry — if any — it’s willing to accept or whether it will push ahead with countermeasures to correct any imbalances.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pressure-seal-trump-trade-deals-082640465.html,Market Risk Political Risk Regulatory Risk 
2025-06-24 21:00:00,The Boeing Company (BA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Zacks.com users have recently been watching Boeing (BA) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Boeing (BA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this airplane builder have returned -0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Boeing belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Boeing is expected to post a loss of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.2%..The consensus earnings estimate of -$1.8 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +91.2%. This estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.95 indicates a change of +263.8% from what Boeing is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Boeing is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)..The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-ba-attracting-investor-130004032.html,No risk.

""It's nothing short of a miracle that no one died or sustained serious physical injuries."".Boeing's on-the-job training was lacking, the NTSB said, adding the planemaker is working on a design enhancement that will ensure the door plug cannot be closed until it is firmly secured..The accident prompted the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation and declare that Boeing was not in compliance with a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement. CEO Dave Calhoun announced he would step down within a few months of the mid-air panel blowout..Homendy praised new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg but said ""he has his work cut out for him, a lot of challenges to address, and that's going to take time."".Boeing said it regretted the accident and it was continuing to work on strengthening safety and quality across its operations..The FAA said Tuesday it has ""fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues."".The incident badly damaged Boeing's reputation and led to a grounding of the MAX 9 for two weeks and a production cap of 38 planes per month by the FAA that still remains in place..""While Boeing is making progress, we will not lift the 737 monthly production cap until we are confident the company can maintain safety and quality while making more aircraft,"" the FAA added..Boeing created no paperwork for the removal of the 737 MAX 9 door plug - a piece of metal shaped like a door covering an unused emergency exit - or its re-installation during production, and still does not know which employees were involved, the NTSB said on Tuesday.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-safety-board-scrutinize-boeing-100833597.html,Operational Risk Reputational Risk Legal Risk Regulatory Risk Financial Risk

Taiwan's oldest airline, established in 1959, is in the midst of a fleet renewal, last year splitting an order for new long-haul aircraft worth almost $12 billion at list prices between Boeing and European rival Airbus.

Some aircraft that were scheduled to be phased out, or handed back at the end of their lease, as some are leased, will remain and have their leases extended,"" he told Reuters in an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, home to Taiwan's main international airport..Boeing has not given China Airlines an exact timeframe for the 787-9 delays, though it has said deliveries will ""basically"" start from the end of 2025, added Kao, a pilot by training who started out as a flight attendant and became chairman in March..""This is written into the contract,"" he said, when asked whether China Airlines would seek compensation..""For example, if it's in the supply chain, the responsibility is Boeing's, and Boeing has to provide some compensation.

In this article, we will summarize the bull’s thesis on AL. Air Lease Corporation's share was trading at $56.40 as of 19th June. AL’s trailing P/E was 9.86 according to Yahoo Finance..Dabarti CGI/Shutterstock.com.Air Lease Corporation (AL) offers a compelling investment story grounded in a simple yet scalable business model—buying aircraft from Airbus and Boeing using mostly investment-grade debt and leasing them to airlines globally on long-term contracts. Founded by industry veteran Steven Udvar-Házy, AL has rapidly grown to own 487 aircraft valued at $28.6 billion, with an average fleet age of 4.7 years and 7.2-year lease terms..Backed by a strong customer base across 70 countries, AL generates 78% of lease revenue from Asia and Europe and has a sizable $17.1 billion aircraft orderbook through 2029, 100% placed through 2026 and 62% placed overall. Industry trends further bolster AL’s prospects: global air travel is steadily rising, and airlines are increasingly adopting “capital-light” models by leasing rather than owning aircraft..Meanwhile, supply constraints from Airbus and Boeing, combined with the roll-off of low-yield COVID-era leases, set the stage for 150–200 bps of yield improvement. Despite these strengths, AL trades at a steep discount to peer AerCap, with a 0.77x tangible book multiple versus AerCap’s 1.3x, largely due to AerCap’s faster book value growth, better capital returns, and clearer investor communications..If AL deploys its full orderbook by 2029, total assets could grow to $50 billion, generating $2.7 billion in operating cash flow or $24/share, implying a stock price of $89 at its historical 3.7x P/OCF multiple, offering a 13% IRR without factoring in buybacks or re-rating. Though risks remain, AL’s younger fleet, solid tailwinds, and deep discount to intrinsic value make it a high-potential opportunity..Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Air Lease Corporation (AL) by Value Don’t Lie in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s resilient leasing model, large forward orderbook, and attractive valuation gap versus AerCap. The company’s stock price has depreciated by approximately 1.5% since our coverage. This is because the thesis has not yet played out in the market. The thesis still stands as long-term fundamentals remain strong. Value Don’t Lie shares an identical view but emphasizes a sharper narrative focus on industry tailwinds and valuation math..Air Lease Corporation is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held AL at the end of the first quarter, which was 30 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Morganlander says he has owned the stock for close to three years and expects strong revenue growth over the next five years..""Although Northrop is a wonderful company, and it's growing profitably and is well capitalized, we thought from the valuation perspective that Lockheed was more attractive,"" Morganlander explained.

The Helicopters business segment registered solid 10% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025..Global demand for multirole helicopters is rising as defense and civil operators seek versatile, cost-effective platforms capable of supporting modern warfare, disaster relief, homeland security and mission adaptability amid aging fleets and expanding needs in emerging markets. This is likely to have prompted the GII Research firm to forecast a CAGR of 7.1% for the global multirole helicopter market during the 2025-2035 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Airbus, with more than 140 armed forces worldwide currently relying on its high-quality, multi-role helicopters, which fulfill a wide range of roles, including armed reconnaissance, utility, attack, naval, maritime and special operations.In particular, Airbus’ H145 helicopter is seeing strong global demand, driven by its success in Helicopter Emergency Medical Services and growing military adoption. Its low noise, reduced CO2 emissions and cost efficiency enhance its appeal. The twin-engine H145M variant adds rapid deployment and combat capabilities, now featuring a five-bladed rotor that increases payload by 150 kg. With more than 1,750 units in service, H145’s versatility, performance, and reliability continue to solidify its global operational value and Airbus’ revenue generation prospects..Other defense companies that are expected to enjoy the perks of the expanding multirole helicopter market have been discussed below:The Boeing Company BA: The company’s helicopters are renowned for their leading-edge, relevant solutions that provide capacity.

Key players like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman anchor this growth. Challenges include rising costs, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the pace of technological innovation. Despite these hurdles, regions such as the Northeast and Midwest remain vital hubs for military production and innovation..U.S. Defense Market.Dublin, June 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""United States Defense Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The United States Defense Market is expected to reach US$ 447.31 billion by 2033 from US$ 314 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 4.01% from 2025 to 2033.The military's purchase and modernization efforts to combat new threats are anticipated to be the main drivers of the US defense market's growth. There is now a need for defense equipment due to a number of active contracts from the military, air force, and naval force, as well as several new contracts that are expected to be distributed over the forecast period. .Due to the country's international military presence, defense policy, and technical dominance, the United States has one of the biggest and most developed defense industries in the world. The industry covers a broad spectrum of defense-related tasks, such as designing, producing, and maintaining military hardware, weaponry, and cybersecurity. With one of the largest military budgets in the world, the United States funds the research and acquisition of advanced technologies including fighter planes, drones, navy ships, and missile defense systems. In a dynamic geopolitical climate, sustaining military primacy and national security is the goal of this investment in technology and defense infrastructure.With major contributions to space exploration, artificial intelligence, aerospace, and cyber defense technology, the sector is also a major force behind innovation. Important participants include private firms that collaborate closely with the Department of Defense and other governmental organizations, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Additionally, a huge nationwide network of supply chains, R&D projects, and skilled labor are all supported by the U.S. military sector. The United States continues to be a dominant force in the military industry, constantly improving its capabilities to address new security threats, despite obstacles including growing competition from superpowers and worries about defense budget.The Air Force and Navy of the United States employ a number of aircraft. The United States is preparing to address any possible problems China could cause for nations with close links to the United States, such as Taiwan and Japan, as a result of the growing international confrontation with China over its aggressiveness in the South China Sea. As a result, during the past several years, large expenditures have been made to upgrade the current fleet and/or buy a new fleet with effective technology.The US aerospace and defense industry is poised for tremendous expansion, but supply chain weaknesses present serious obstacles. The pandemic's effects on production and logistics demonstrate how vulnerable the industry's supply networks, which are frequently complex and worldwide, are to interruptions. Furthermore, new avenues for cybersecurity threats are created by the growing integration of digital technology and networking in defensive systems. A major worry is the increasing sophistication of state-sponsored cyberthreats that target defense contractors and vital infrastructure. For example, there were 30,659 cybersecurity assaults on US federal institutions in 2022.Growth Drivers for the United States Defense Market",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-defense-industry-report-131400098.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Technological Risk

Airbus had a lot to say and $21 billion in orders to announce , but unfortunately, its great rival, Boeing (NYSE: BA), had very little to say..While Boeing didn't release an official statement on the matter, it's widely reported that Boeing scaled down its participation and elected not to announce new orders following a recent Air India crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Boeing had previously announced it would offer full support for the investigation currently taking place..Consequently, Airbus took center stage in the commercial aerospace industry, announcing $14.2 billion in firm orders and a further $6.7 billion under memoranda of understanding (MoUs)..Among the 148 firm orders was the first-ever order from LOT Polish Airlines for 40 A220 aircraft. All Nippon Airways, a subsidiary, ordered 27 A321 airplanes. Riyadh Air of Saudi Arabia ordered 25 A350 wide-bodies and will be the first Saudi airline to fly the 350. Vietnam's VietJet signed an MoU for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft..The strength in A350 (which competes with the Boeing 787) and A321 orders (a highly successful plane Boeing is struggling to compete with) is a continuation of an order trend this year. Meanwhile, the 40 A220 orders are a shot in the arm for an aircraft that Airbus has found it difficult to sign deals on in the last year or so..Overall, it was a positive air show for Airbus, and that's reflected in the stock price today..Before you buy stock in Airbus SE, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Airbus SE wasn’t one of them.

Per the terms of the deal, RTX will provide test equipment and spares, as well as exercise options for ESSM Block 2 guided missile assemblies..The work related to this contract will be executed in multiple locations globally, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and a few other nations. This contract is projected to be completed by September 2030.The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C..With countries worldwide enhancing their defense capabilities, spending on advanced military arms and ammunition has been rapidly increasing lately. This includes growing investments in missiles and missile systems, which are essential for modern warfare. RTX, as a prominent manufacturer of missile systems, has thus been witnessing a steady flow of orders from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies. The recent contract is an example of that.RTX’s ESSM Block II is a versatile, combat-proven naval defense system with more than 330 successful live sea firings. Offering enhanced performance over Block I, it strengthens fleet protection against diverse threats. These advanced features likely drive its growing demand, reflected in the latest contract win..Rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have led nations to increase their focus on national security, particularly on missile defense systems in recent times, backed by the rapid development of advanced missile technologies over the last decade.This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5% for the global missiles and missile defense systems market during the 2025-2030 time period.Such strong growth projections indicate solid opportunities for RTX, which has a handful of combat-proven missiles in its product portfolio, like the TOW missile, Guidance Enhanced Missile, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 and a few more, in addition to the ESSM..Other defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missiles and missile system market have been discussed below:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop Grumman provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system.

ERJ recently clinched a contract from SkyWest Inc. for delivering 60 of its E175 aircraft, with purchase rights for 50 additional aircraft. These jet deliveries are expected to start in 2027. The aforementioned orders should boost Embraer’s future revenue stream and bolster its profitability..The E-175 is a regional jet recognized for its fuel efficiency, superior avionics and spacious cabin. It is also appreciated for its comfort, operational agility and short to medium-distance trips. It offers seating for 76-88 passengers and features a flying range of 2,200 nautical miles (4,074 km).Due to such remarkable features, Embraer must have been witnessing a steady inflow of orders for this jet model. The recent order placed by SkyWest is a bright example..Rising air passenger traffic, backed by enhanced air travel among passengers and executives, along with the increasing demand for fuel-efficient and modern aircraft, is driving growth in the commercial aviation market.

It was this model that crashed 30 seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on June 12..Air India said that enhanced safety inspections ordered by India’s aviation regulator will also be extended to its larger Boeing 777 planes “as a matter of added precaution”..The carrier said the decision to cancel flights reflected “the necessary cautious approach being taken by the engineering staff and Air India pilots”..Out of 33 Dreamliners in the Air India fleet, 26 have so far been examined and cleared for service, something the company said should provide “reassurance” about its safety procedures..It added: “The investigating authorities are continuing their efforts to find out the reasons for the accident.”.However, Air India said it will now have a pool of reserve aircraft “to take care of any unplanned disruptions” after 83 flights were cancelled over the past six days..It comes as Air India’s owners seek to bolster confidence in the carrier following the crash involving London-bound Flight 171, which killed all but one of the 242 people on board, together with dozens more on the ground..N Chandrasekaran, chairman of both Air India and its owner Tata Group, said it could be a month before preliminary results from the ongoing inquiry into the country’s worst air disaster in almost three decades are known..He said: “There are speculations about human error, speculations about airlines, speculations about engines, maintenance, all kinds..“But the fact that I know so far, is this particular aircraft, this specific tail, AI-171 has a clean history.”.Mr Chandrasekaran said the “histories” of both of the plane’s engines were also “clean.”.Experts have highlighted engine failure as a possible cause of the tragedy after a mayday message from the plane mentioned a loss of power, thrust and lift..Mr Chandrasekaran told India’s Economic Times that the 787’s right-hand engine was new and installed in March, while the left engine was serviced in 2023 and due for its next maintenance check in December..He also defended the flight’s captain and first officer, who had amassed 11,500 and 3,400 flying hours, respectively..He said: “What I hear from colleagues is that they were excellent pilots and great professionals.

Comparing pairs of leading American and foreign firms across major industries, the data highlights a striking trend: U.S. giants have often lagged far behind their overseas counterparts in terms of shareholder returns. While this isn’t sweeping across every industry — with giants like Nvidia (NVDA) outpacing nearly any company on the planet — it does highlight a concerning trend amongst America’s biggest names..Long before Boeing (BA) faced the recent Air India crash — an event that sent its shares down about 4% — the company was already being outperformed by its European rival, Airbus (EADSY). From 2000 through 2020, Boeing and Airbus traded in close lockstep, but since then, their paths have diverged sharply.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines..While both companies have experienced periods of growth and volatility, Airbus has decisively pulled ahead in total returns. Boeing has been plagued over the years with a number of high-profile events that make the stock difficult to invest in, despite being a global leader in a lucrative industry. Most notable was the disastrous launch of the Boeing 737 MAX, a plane that was sent out all over the world with some serious issues, which then resulted in 346 people’s deaths from 2 crashes. This event caused Boeing to lose an estimated $60 billion from fines, legal fees, order cancellations, and other costs..While this is largely in the rear-view mirror, every subsequent incident or crash involving Boeing planes is widely publicized and heavily scrutinized, making it difficult for the stock to get ahead.

Ortberg explained duty drawback mechanisms and ongoing supplier negotiations, while West estimated net annual tariff costs to be less than $500 million..Scott Deuschle (Deutsche Bank) asked about free cash flow cadence for 2025. West said the second half is expected to be positive, driven by production and delivery increases, but guidance will be revisited as China and tariff clarity emerges..Richard Safran (Seaport Research Partners) asked about the scope and future of digital aviation divestitures.

Some resources like the B-2 bomber are in the US while other assets are either in the region or on the way..It’s unclear whether Trump will deepen US involvement beyond helping Israel defend against Iranian air attacks as he has done in recent days.

One weapon, though, is seen as particularly effective if the situation were to escalate and draw the direct involvement of the US..The Massive Ordnance Penetrator or “MOP” — better known as the bunker-buster bomb — weighs 30,000 pounds and is the world’s largest precision-guided weapon. The GPS-directed bomb, assembled by Boeing Co., has been touted repeatedly as the only weapon capable of delivering a knockout blow to Tehran’s atomic ambitions, which would require a successful strike on the heavily protected enrichment site at Fordow..Hidden beneath a mountain and believed to be buried around 60 to 90 meters deep, many experts believe that damaging Fordow can be achieved only by the MOP — a weapon the US alone possesses..Each bunker buster can be independently targeted and released, “making it possible to deliver a MOP right on top of another MOP,” said Rebecca Grant, a Lexington Institute analyst. Grant said drone surveillance in the area could also help the military “refine the strike” at the last minute and noted that Iranian nuclear facilities such as Fordow have been studied by the US for years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bunker-buster-bomb-draws-focus-194655423.html,Geopolitical Risk Market Risk Operational Risk Reputational Risk Financial Risk

Given that Europe is Airbus’ home territory, and Boeing has had a range of issues—plus, it presents a difficult picture due to tariffs—the idea that Airbus would be favored at the Paris Air Show probably should have been expected. Certainly Boeing did not go away empty-handed, but Airbus picked up new orders aplenty, including 30 A320NEO craft and 10 A350 freighters from AviLease..Boeing, meanwhile, had a bit of a subdued presence at the event, with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (as well as Executive Vice President) Stephanie Pope visibly absent. While we know that Boeing came out strong with new things to show off at the event, we also know that May was huge for Boeing orders, so a certain amount of subdued presence makes sense here. But with the recent Air India disaster coloring things—particularly since it was a 777 Dreamliner that was involved, the first such incident in the plane’s history—that Boeing might keep some of its top brass home during the event is not especially surprising..But perhaps even bigger than the Boeing and Airbus issues was the unexpected snub delivered to Israel over its presentation of weapons systems. That there are defense systems present at the Paris Air Show is nothing new, nor should be surprising. In fact, reports note that interest in “…the defense side of the show…” was high, particularly given geopolitical conditions these days..Apparently, the Paris Air Show took exception to Israeli companies, who found their stands forcibly closed as they displayed “attack weapons.” The Paris Air Show called on the Israelis to remove their weapons displays, to which the Israelis responded in the negative. Thus, the black partition you see in the picture above were set up, covering the Israeli display from view. The legend, written in yellow over the black, reads: “Behind these walls are the best defense systems used by many countries. These systems are protecting the state of Israel these days.

Fuel savings also contributed to significant reductions across emissions categories. The Gen3 system was developed to enhance power delivery, improve acceleration, cut replacement and maintenance time, and significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions on hybrid buses..""BAE Systems' Gen3 drivetrain technology raises the standard again for the transit industry,"" said Bob Lamanna, vice president and general manager of Power & Propulsion Solutions at BAE Systems. ""The test results highlight the efficiency of our proven technology, which enhances sustainability while delivering the reliability, performance, and cost savings that transit authorities expect."".For several months, the bus was tested with the company's Gen3 drive train system across various duty cycles to monitor fuel economy and emissions performance.

With testing completed, FTA grant funding for the system is now available for transit agencies around the country..BAE Systems' Gen3 system includes a traction motor, onboard energy-storage system, and smart-power electronics to create a clean, integrated electric propulsion and accessory power system for buses. The modular power control system and electric motor also use fewer components, connections, and cables compared to previous iterations. This increases reliability and makes it easier to service, while still delivering a smooth and quiet ride for passengers..The system builds on proven components with next-generation developments, incorporating advanced materials such as silicon carbide with a lightweight, compact design to maximize electrical efficiency, improve fuel economy, and decreased emissions..BAE Systems has nearly 30 years of experience developing and integrating electric drive systems for buses and heavy-duty vehicles.

Since then, the company has raised $24 billion in cash and begun the painstaking process of rebuilding its troubled manufacturing operations..Boeing also has no plans to fold the services unit, its only steady money-maker this decade, into the company’s larger commercial airplane and defense operations, Raymond said..Analysts had widely speculated that Boeing Global Services might be dissolved to cut down on overhead, and that its disparate array of offerings, from spare-parts distribution to digital analytics and pilot training, might be pruned and sold after Ortberg unveiled plans to shrink Boeing last year..But the planemaker appears to be pulling out of its financial tailspin, as the tempo and quality of work in its factories improves. Boeing also got a larger-than-expected windfall from Jeppesen, which provides navigation and flight-planning products. It is being sold to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $10.5 billion in a deal slated to close late this year..While Boeing would have preferred to keep the profitable business, the move was necessary to provide a financial cushion at a time when Boeing needed it..“I think we’ve got the portfolio that we like,” Raymond said. “Obviously, that was a valuable property in Jeppesen, and that was about the Boeing balance sheet, if you will.”.For now, demand is booming for services tied to extending the commercial lives of jets, given a multi-year shortage of new aircraft. Boeing is seeing a surge of interest in refitting aircraft cabins with newer seats, and for the latest broadband service — particularly SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system, Raymond said..The smallest of Boeing’s three main businesses has been its steadiest performer in recent years: Global Services was the only division to post an operating profit in 2024, when the company posted an adjusted operating loss of $13.1 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-plans-no-further-changes-162951897.html,No risk.
2025-06-17 21:16:00,Airbus Wins Order to Supply 25 A350-1000 Airplanes to Riyadh Air,"EADSY lands a major deal with Riyadh Air for 25 A350-1000 jets, reinforcing global demand for its fuel-efficient aircraft.","Airbus SE EADSY recently secured a firm order from the Saudi Arabian airline, Riyadh Air, to supply 25 of its A350-1000 commercial aircraft. The deal, with the potential to include another 25 aircraft, was inked at the Paris Air Show.This contract win strengthens Airbus’ A350 position globally and should boost the company’s future revenues once the deliveries get started..The A350 offers the longest-range capability of any commercial airliner in production today, with the capacity to save at least 20% fuel and reduce CO??? emissions. The A350 family can operate on up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel and aims for 100% by 2030.Such remarkable features must have been bolstering the demand for this jet family, translating into solid order growth, like the latest one. This jet line’s solid demand can be further gauged from the more than 1,390 firm orders it has won from more than 60 customers globally, with 657 aircraft in service (as of May end)..Rising air passenger traffic, backed by enhanced air travel among passengers and executives, along with the increasing demand for fuel-efficient and modern aircraft, is driving growth in the commercial aviation market. To this end, Airbus forecasts demand for 43,420 new aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years. This demand should get translated into meaningful revenue growth for this jet giant. In line with this, during 2024, EADSY registered 6% year-over-year revenue growth from commercial aircraft activities, backed by a 4.2% rise in commercial aircraft deliveries. As of May 2025, the company has delivered 243 commercial aircraft to 61 customers. We may expect the company to continue to record similar revenue growth in the coming quarters as well, thanks to such robust delivery numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2025 and 2026 revenues suggests an annual improvement of 10.4% each year, further supporting this thesis..Other prominent commercial aerospace players that are also expected to gain from the rising jet delivery demand trends are mentioned below:The Boeing Company BA: The company enjoys a strong business footprint globally and has been the manufacturer of premier commercial jetliners for decades. Its commercial portfolio includes the 737, 767, 777 and 787 families of aircraft, as well as the Boeing Business Jet line.Boeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 18.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2025 sales calls for an improvement of 25.6%.Embraer S.A. ERJ: The company is the third-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft in the world. Its product portfolio of commercial jets includes E175-E2, E190-E2 and E195-E2.Embraer delivered an average earnings surprise of 150.60% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERJ’s 2025 sales implies an improvement of 15.9%.Textron Inc. TXT: The company offers a wide range of commercial aircraft solutions, particularly business jets. Its product portfolio includes a handful of business aircraft like the Citation M2 Gen3, Citation CJ4 Gen3, Citation CJ3 Gen3, Citation Latitude and the Citation Longitude.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.

The post Amazon uses 21 Air for new dedicated cargo service to Colombia appeared first on FreightWaves.,"Amazon’s private cargo airline, created to expedite online deliveries, has launched its first dedicated South American route with the help of two other carriers: 21 Air, a small U.S. freight operator, and Avianca, a major Latin American airline with a strong cargo arm..Amazon announced earlier this month the signing of Avianca Cargo as a customer for its new service that offers unused freighter space to third-party shippers. Avianca is booking shipments on Amazon Air backhaul flights from Bogotá, Colombia, to Miami that otherwise would be empty..The news release was issued by Amazon Air Cargo, the business unit that sells wholesale air cargo service to freight forwarders and other logistics operators, to highlight it is open for business to shippers in Colombia and the region..The announcement didn’t focus on the fact that in-house airline Amazon Air, which has an extensive transport network in the United States and more limited footprints in Europe and India, is now operating internationally, bringing to Colombia inbound parcels filled with goods ordered on its marketplace. The daily flights, which began on April 8 utilizing a Boeing 767-300 converted freighter, mark the first time Amazon Air has conducted cross-border flights, excluding activity in close-knit Europe..Amazon Air relies on partner airlines because it isn’t certified to fly commercial aircraft and doesn’t have its own pilots. It has a fleet of nearly 100 converted freighters, including 10 Airbus A330-300s and Boeing 737-800 narrowbody aircraft..FreightWaves identified 21 Air as the carrier operating the Miami-Bogota route on Amazon Air’s behalf, based on flight data from AirNav Radar. 21 Air, which began flying for Amazon in November, is based at Miami International Airport. It has a fleet of 16 Boeing 767s, six of which were supplied by Amazon. Amazon spokeswoman Gabriela Castillo confirmed that 21 Air is the underlying carrier for the Bogota service..21 Air also operates in Amazon’s traditional parcel network between San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami and Amazon’s superhub at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport in Ohio..Avianca Cargo, which operates six Airbus A330-200 freighter aircraft in addition to managing shipments carried by the airline’s passenger fleet, said the northbound Amazon flights will be used to transport flowers and other products to the U.S. market. Miami is the largest U.S. gateway for fresh flowers..Amazon has been offering international shipping to Colombia since 2019. Prior to the new dedicated air cargo service it relied on ocean freight or other commercial airlines to move products to fulfillment warehouses in the country. In late May, it introduced the Amazon Prime paid subscription service for shoppers in Colombia.

The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.The majority of the work related to this contract will be performed in Tucson, AZ, and East Camden, AR. This contract is projected to be completed by May 2029..Rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have led nations to increase their focus on national security, particularly on missile defense systems in recent times, backed by the rapid development of advanced missile technologies over the last decade.This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5% for the global missiles and missile defense system market during the 2025-2030 period.Such massive growth projections offer a strategic advantage to RTX, which has a handful of combat-proven missiles in its product portfolio, like the TOW missile, Guidance Enhanced Missile, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, Tomahawk and a few more, in addition to the SM-6.In particular, SM-6 missile defends against air, surface and ballistic threats, offering cost-effective protection for 60 naval ships. With more than 500 units delivered to the U.S. Navy, its advanced features continue to drive demand, further corroborated by the latest contract award..Other defense contractors that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missiles and missile system market have been discussed below:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop Grumman provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system. It also develops and builds advanced missile defense technology, ranging from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.The company’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 2.8%.The Boeing Company BA: It manufactures various missile defense systems, including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Avenger.

For key US players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, the show comes at a critical moment..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Both Archer and Joby went public in 2020 during the SPAC craze. Like a lot of SPAC companies, their appeal to investors was largely speculative — and, five years later, remains somewhat speculative (neither has completed a commercial flight yet). But promises of a Jetsons-esque future of battery-powered flying taxis are starting to look a little more real, especially after a slew of developments in just the past couple of weeks..At the end of May, Joby announced it received $250 million from Toyota, the second tranche of a $500 million investment from the major automaker announced in October (which itself followed a previous $394 million investment from Toyota). Then, last week, came the big news: As part of a broader initiative to promote domestic drone production, the White House issued an executive order to launch a pilot program for the nascent industry..The announcement brought renewed interest to the pair of eVTOL firms, which showed both companies may have climbed a little too close to the sun:.Shares of Joby had spiked more than 30% in the days immediately following the announcement of the Toyota cash infusion. That led analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald to quell some of the excitement, downgrading the stock from overweight to neutral while highlighting the company’s high cash-burn rate and lack of near-term upside..Archer, meanwhile, seized the opportunity presented by the White House’s encouraging executive orders to sell $850 million of stock on Friday, which dragged its share price down 15%. It did recover nearly 4% on Monday, however..Cleared for Takeoff: But what about the question that may matter the most: When will these birds finally fly? It’s tough to say. Both companies have scored deals to launch air taxi services in the United Arab Emirates, with Archer saying industry standards in the country should be finalized by next month and Joby saying service could start as soon as early next year. Both companies have also struck deals with major US airlines — Archer with United and Joby with Delta — to eventually ferry passengers to and from major US airports. Archer has also struck a deal to become the official air taxi partner of the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, which shows the lengths to which Angelenos will go to avoid their infamous traffic jams..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Riyadh Air placed an order for 25 long-range Airbus jets..However, Riyadh hopes to launch later this year with a fleet of Boeing 787s, the same jet involved in the Air India disaster..A mayday call made in the last seconds of the Air India flight indicated a lack of thrust and lift, causing experts to speculate that it may have suffered a dual engine failure..A bird strike has been suggested as a possible cause, together with fuel contamination or a maintenance error, though other theories envisage problems with electronic engine controls or the plane’s wing flaps, which help generate lift..Mr Douglas, who previously ran Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, said he was confident that analysis of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders would allow experts to pin down the exact causes of the crash..He said: “It was shocking, utterly shocking. Everybody’s thoughts go out to the people affected..“But the accident investigation team will get to the bottom of it, they always do, and there’ll be a clearer understanding..“The black box will probably give the large majority of the clues as to what actually happened.

There are almost 1,200 of them in service and this is the first time any one of them has had an incident.”.He added that there was “no comparison” between the 787, which had flown for more than a decade before last week’s tragedy, and the smaller 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide for more than 18 months following two fatal crashes triggered by a software that interfered with the flying of the model.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-afraid-boeing-planes-060000037.html,No risk.

But the company recently got a reprieve from a trial that would've been its biggest yet..On June 2, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor removed Boeing's upcoming criminal trial from the docket, as the court considers a motion to dismiss a fraud case against the jet maker that stemmed from two deadly crashes (in 2018 and 2019) of 737 MAX aircraft. Investors are still awaiting the court's final decision, but things seem to be moving in a good direction. A crash of a Boeing Dreamliner last week in India knocked the stock down a bit, but it's up 14% so far this year..Boeing had been set to stand trial, starting on June 23, for allegedly misleading federal regulators about a stability-control system in the 737 MAX that played a role in the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019. In total, 346 passengers died in the plane crashes..But in late May, the Department of Justice and Boeing came to terms on a non-prosecution agreement, and the DOJ promptly asked the presiding court to drop the case..As O'Connor weighs the 11th-hour motion to dismiss the case -- and considers the objections of the crash victims' families -- the stakes couldn't be higher for Boeing..If the court drops the case, Boeing avoids a potential felony conviction. It also dodges an ugly, high-profile criminal trial that would've kept Boeing in the news for all the wrong reasons..From a 30,000-foot view, it would lift a legal cloud that's been looming over the company since the 737 MAX tragedies, which could help clear the runway for Boeing to rebuild its reputation and restore investor confidence..Under federal law, O'Connor must consider the arguments of the crash victims' families, who have said they will fight the DOJ's motion to dismiss the case against Boeing. Their objections are due by June 18, after which the DOJ and Boeing will have a week to respond..It's worth noting that in December 2024, O'Connor rejected a proposed plea deal that would've established an ""independent compliance monitor"" to oversee Boeing's reform efforts, in addition to levying millions of dollars in financial penalties.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-could-avoid-trial-001000677.html,Operational Risk Legal Risk Reputational Risk

The attacks – the first of many to come according to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – sparked an immediate retaliation from Iran..Oil prices shot up as traders pondered the possibility of Iran disrupting the flow of crude through the Strait of Hormuz or striking its Gulf neighbours' oilfields as it has done in the past.

Reeves admitted it was a blow, as the government banks on spurring economic growth to fund its bold spending plans..Let's take a closer look at these and other stories from an eventful few days..Boeing stock slumps after deadly Air India plane crash.It was reportedly the first deadly crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its launch 14 years ago.

He has cancelled his trip to Paris and is instead scrambling to handle the fallout from the disaster..Ortberg told Boeing staff that both he and Stephanie Pope, head of commercial aviation, had called off their trips to France next week “so we can be with our team and focus on our customer and the investigation”..The accident saw the London-bound 787-8 plane operated by Air India plummet towards the ground just moments after taking off, smashing into the city below and killing all but one of the 242 people aboard, along with several inside the buildings the plane struck..The exact cause of the tragedy is yet to be determined. Most crashes are the result of pilot errors..There is so far no evidence to point to problems with Boeing’s plane as the cause..But feverish speculation about the company’s potential culpability began almost instantly, underlining the reputational damage done by the repeated safety scandals and accidents involving its jets..On Friday, India’s ministry of civil aviation fanned further questions by suggesting to local media that it was considering grounding the country’s fleet of 787-8s..Ortberg and his team will now spend the coming days soberly working with Indian authorities to help unravel how the tragic accident unfolded – and convince them that Boeing’s jets are safe..“Safety is foundational to our industry and is at the core of everything that we do,” Ortberg said in his email to employees..“Our technical experts are prepared to assist investigators to understand the circumstances, and a Boeing team stands ready to travel to India.”.Most experts caution that with so little information yet known about the aircraft’s systems before it crashed, it is difficult to draw any concrete conclusions about the causes..Yet with Boeing still under pressure over safety issues, the company may find passengers and investors are less willing to give it the benefit of the doubt..Shares in the company dropped 4.8pc on Thursday, wiping billions of dollars from its value..That is despite the fact that its 787 Dreamliner planes have a near-spotless record, with none of them ever involved in a serious accident until now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-thought-safety-crisis-over-135749975.html,Operational Risk Reputational Risk Legal and Regulatory Risk Financial Risk

This accident raised concerns about safety in air travel, and as a consequence, shares of Boeing fell 4.8% yesterday. Pre-market trading is showing a further decline of 1.1%. All passengers, except one, and all crew members lost their lives..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.This fatal accident is raising questions about the safety of Boeing’s commercial airplane model. Although the 787-8 Dreamliner is involved in such a devastating accident for the first time, Boeing’s 737 Max model was involved in two major crashes and was grounded for almost a year. It was allowed to resume operation after adding safety measures..The real reason behind the fatal crash of Air India flight (AI 171) is still being investigated by government agencies. Analyzing the videos, a few aviation experts suggested that the lack of engine thrust after takeoff was the primary reason behind the accident. Experts are considering the failure of the dual engines of Boeing’s 787-8 Dreamliner as the cause of the crash. Some experts also suggested that a bird hit or a lack of fuel supply might have stopped the engines from functioning properly, which is the lifeline of the aircraft..One of the two black boxes of AI 171 has been recovered from the wreckage, and the search continues for the other. While engine failure, human error or lack of proper maintenance are the probabilities linked to the accident, the exact cause will come to light only after a thorough analysis..Boeing’s management has offered its deepest condolences to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected in Ahmedabad. The company also informed that it will offer full support to the investigation led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau..The company still has a long backlog for its commercial aircraft model. The total backlog of Boeing’s different models of commercial aircraft is 5,943, which indicates wide acceptance of its aircraft among the airliners. Many airliners might reconsider their existing orders with Boeing after the fatal crash of AI 171, which can benefit its rival Airbus Group EADSY. Airbus’ current backlog of commercial aircraft stands at 8,630..Thousands of flights took off and landed safely globally on the same day. Such incidents affect the confidence of the flier, yet that does not stop airliners from carrying out their operations.Last year, Boeing projected a 3% increase in airplane deliveries over the next 20 years, with airliners requiring nearly 44,000 new commercial airplanes by 2043. Per this projection, there is ample scope for aircraft producers and suppliers to provide the necessary parts to build airplanes. Boeing uses General Electric’s GE unit GE Aerospace and Rolls Royce engines for its aircraft. The engine supplier will benefit from the increasing demand for new airplanes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-india-run-787-dreamliner-123900289.html,Operational Risk Market Risk Reputational Risk Legal Risk

The aircraft, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick..While the cause of the crash is still under investigation, analysts noted the aircraft's historically strong safety record..“The crash represents the first fatal accident involving a 787 since the type entered service in September 2011,” said Jefferies (JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu..Read more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks drop and oil prices soars as Israel strikes Iran in major escalation.Despite this, the 787’s entry into service was marked by early technical issues, including a spate of battery-related incidents in 2013 that led to a temporary global grounding of the model.

The Government Accountability Office said in a report this week that “ongoing design issues, modification rework, and workforce challenges” are still plaguing the manufacturer. The Trump administration has resorted to procuring a $400 million jet from Qatar to serve as the interim Air Force One..Boeing is continuing to battle production issues plaguing the jets that will serve as Air Force One, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)..The Pentagon told the congressional auditors that “ongoing design issues, modification rework, and workforce challenges slowed the progress toward modifying two Boeing 747-8 aircraft into presidential aircraft,” a report released Wednesday said..The United States, under President Donald Trump, signed a $3.9 billion contract with Boeing in 2018 to have two planes designed, modified, and tested to serve as Air Force One by 2024, but persistent delays have pushed the project past its delivery date..In order for the aircraft to meet Air Force One specifications, Boeing needs to heavily modify the jets to meet travel and top-level security needs, which has slowed down the production process considerably. Trump has dropped a requirement for the VC-25B planes to have air-to-air flying capabilities, which would allow them to receive fuel from a tanker aircraft while in flight..Progress on the aircraft has stalled as a result of issues around decompression and the environmental control system design, and Boeing’s incomplete certification plans and aircraft design have also pushed back the timetable for testing, the GAO said. The aircraft manufacturer has also been unable to keep a steady workforce for the project..“Boeing still faces challenges hiring and retaining qualified mechanics due to ongoing market conditions, according to VC-25B officials,” the report said. “Program officials said that approval rates for mechanics to acquire necessary clearances remain a workforce limitation.”.Last fall, Boeing announced plans to lay off 10% of its workforce, despite industrywide talent shortages..As Boeing tries to push through its scheduling woes, Trump has instead procured a $400 million Boeing 474 from Qatar after threatening in February to find alternatives to the VC-25B project. The gifted Qatari jet has not only raised ethical and security concerns, but it will likely cost taxpayers $1 billion to service and update the jet to Air Force One standards.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-air-force-one-production-090000698.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk Contractual Risk

2025-06-13 05:34:00,Wall Street weighs in on Boeing after digesting deadly Air India crash,"Investing.com -- Several Wall Street analysts weighed in on Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) after today’s deadly Air India crash that killed 241 passengers and crew, with one person miraculously walking away. The flight, headed to London’s Gatwick Airport, crashed in Ahmedabad in western India shortly after take-off on Thursday.","Investing.com -- Several Wall Street analysts weighed in on  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) after today’s deadly Air India crash that killed 241 passengers and crew, with one person miraculously walking away. The flight, headed to London’s Gatwick Airport, crashed in Ahmedabad in western India shortly after take-off on Thursday..The plane that crashed was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, it had been in service since 2014. Multiple analysts noted that the plane has a “very good” track record, with this being the first fatal crash. However, the 787 experienced several battery-related incidents soon after entering service in 2011..“The crash represents the first fatal accident involving a 787 since the type entered service in September 2011,” Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu stated..“… we would note that the 787 has a very strong safety record,” RBC Capital’s Ken Herbert added..Video of the crash shows the aircraft struggling to gain altitude before quickly descending and crashing..""Initial ADS-B data from flight #AI171 shows that the aircraft reached a maximum barometric altitude of 625 feet (airport altitude is about 200 feet) and then it started to descend with an vertical speed of -475 feet per minute,"" Flightradar24 said in a post on X..“The flight path after takeoff shows a slow rate of climb, before a rapid descent, suggesting a loss of power on takeoff, which would most likely be traced to the engines,” Bernstein’s Douglas Harned commented..Harned further notes that commentary by aviation experts has focused on engine failure, with a multiple bird strike situation as a possibility. The plane was equipped with The GEnx engines and GE Aerospace is reportedly sending a team to the site for the investigation..The analyst added that maintenance performance is always a possibility in situations like this - airframe or engine..Analysts note that Boeing is still in the penalty box, given its past incidents. Shares closed down 4.8% today..“… after the Boeing MAX crashes in 2018-2019, it is understandable that investors will take a cautious view on the stock, even though the implications of the crash are not known at this time,” Herbert commented. “However, we would comment that after several of the more recent air crashes or incidents involving Boeing aircraft, the stock has been down an average of (5%) on that day, and then down an average of (6%) one week after the accident. We looked at the two MAX crashes, as well as two 787 battery fires, and the MAX door-plug incident in calculating these returns.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-weighs-boeing-digesting-213425219.html,Reputational Risk Operational Risk Financial Risk

Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the same Boeing jet model, crashed months later and killed 157..Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal with the plane manufacturer, allowing it to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the jet model prior to both deadly accidents. The Justice Department will drop its fraud charges so long as Boeing  pays a $1.1 billion fine, as well as $445 million to the crash victims’ families..The Dreamliner 787 aircraft, until Thursday, had never experienced a fatal crash, but it has been under scrutiny for years. The Federal Aviation Administration halted production of the aircraft in 2021, just 10 years after the model was introduced, after finding a manufacturing flaw. Though manufacturing resumed the next year, Boeing whistleblowers have raised concerns about the Dreamliner. Longtime Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour filed a complaint to the FAA and told Congress in April 2024 that the skin on the Dreamliner jets were not fastened appropriately, putting them at risk to break apart.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-stock-sinks-fatal-crash-154520958.html,Operational Risk Reputational Risk Financial Risk Legal & Regulatory Risk

This incident, involving one of Boeing's most modern aircraft, reignites concerns about the company's safety record, which has been under intense scrutiny following previous incidents. The potential for a lengthy investigation and renewed regulatory oversight is weighing heavily on investor sentiment..The shares closed the day at $203.75, down 4.8% from previous close..The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Boeing? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free..Boeing’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 8 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business..The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 2 months ago when the stock dropped 10.1% on the news that China imposed a 34% tariff on all U.S. imports amid escalating trade war tensions. This was partly in response to the ""reciprocal tariffs"" announced by the Trump administration the previous day, with levies on Chinese goods estimated to be as high as 50%..Already facing increased competition from domestic aircraft manufacturers, Boeing risked becoming even less competitive. Also, China has historically been a significant source of demand for Boeing's commercial aircraft, and the new tariffs could delay or derail future orders. For investors, this development raised concerns about Boeing's ability to regain momentum in a market essential to its growth..Boeing is up 18.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $203.75 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $217.51 from June 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Boeing’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,075..Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

It was the first fatal crash since the plane, also known as the Dreamliner, went into service in 2011, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. Boeing shares fell more than 4% in afternoon trading..The 787 was the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, recharge faster and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. In 2013 the 787 fleet was temporarily grounded because of overheating of its lithium-ion batteries, which in some cases sparked fires..737 Max.The Max version of Boeing's best-selling 737 airplane has been the source of persistent troubles for Boeing after two of the jets crashed. The crashes, one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019, killed 346..The problem stemmed from a sensor providing faulty readings that pushed the nose down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system..Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal to allow Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the Max before the two crashes..Worries about the plane flared up again after a door plug blew off a Max operated by Alaska Airlines, leading regulators to cap Boeing's production at 38 jets per month..Financial woes.Boeing posted a loss of $11.8 billion in 2024, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion..The company's financial problems were compounded by a strike by machinists who assemble the airplanes plane at its factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, which halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing’s delivery capability..For the first three months of 2025, Boeing reported a narrower loss of $31 million compared with the previous year. CEO Kelly Ortberg said Boeing made progress on stabilizing operations during the quarter..Orders and deliveries.The stepped-up government scrutiny and the workers’ strike resulted in Boeing's aircraft deliveries sliding last year..Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners in 2024, which was a third fewer than the 528 that it reported for the previous year..The company delivered less than half the number of commercial aircraft to customers than its main rival Airbus, which reported delivering 766 commercial jets in 2023..Still, Boeing's troubles haven't turned off airline customers from buying its jets. Last month the company secured big orders from two Middle Eastern customers. The deals included a $96 billion order for 787 and 777X jets from Qatar, which it said was the biggest order for 787s and wide body jets in the company's.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-boeings-recent-troubles-air-133406113.html,Operational Risk Reputational Risk Market Risk

Boyd Group International president and Synovus vice president and senior portfolio manager Mike Boyd joins Morning Brief with Brad Smith to discuss the latest..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff on Thursday. Thick plumes of black smoke seen over the airport in video taken by bystanders. 242 passengers and crew members were on board the flight heading to London's Gatwick Airport. The plane crashed into a building housing medical students, according to local media. Aftermath from the scene showed billowing smoke rising over the area and firefighters on charred streets. Air India confirmed the flight was involved in an accident after takeoff in a post on X. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the tragedy heartbreaking beyond words. In a statement Thursday, Boeing said it's in contact with Air India regarding flight 171 and stands ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders, and all affected. Boeing's safety record has faced scrutiny following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 that led to more than 340 deaths. The FAA ordered an inspection of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner back in 2024 after a midair dive on a Latam flight in March injured more than 50 passengers. A whistleblower last year also urged Boeing to ground all 787 Dreamliners worldwide, claiming there were flaws in the plane's assembly. Boeing rejected the claims by the former engineer and said it was fully confident in the plane. Joining me now, we've got Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. Mike, thanks for taking some time and hopping on with us this morning. After a tragedy like this, should passengers be worried about flying on Boeing planes? But specifically as we're looking across some of the large plane manufacturing that they do, some of the negligence that's come to be known and the changes that they're making, is it swiftly enough? .It is uh the two aren't really connected at this point in time. You know, there's there's no indication whatsoever, you know, that what that whistleblower brought up and I I looked very heavily at that and what happened today, there's no indication. These airplanes, 10, 11 years old, okay, it's been flying around. So the real issue is should some people feel safe about flying? The answer is absolutely yes. And we'll know more about this in a few days because between the NTSB and the US which is going to be on the scene and the Indian uh uh investigators, we'll we'll have some a pretty good idea of what really did happen with this specific airplane. .We do know as well this year, 75 to 80 deliveries are projected of this 787 Dreamliner versus the 51 in 2024. Just how vastly different is Boeing today versus some of the issues that they faced in 2018, 2019? .Well, in 2018, 2019, let's put it right on the line. They were an incompetently managed airline airplane manufacturer. They didn't know what they were doing. They were looking at stock price. The fact of the matter today, they are much more rationally run air airplane manufacturer. Plus, the FAA is on the scene all the time. Now keep in mind, the FAA was involved with the poor oversight before, but right now, uh there's a lot more going on at Boeing to make sure that they're doing things right because they weren't doing it back in 2019. .There are many more details that we're waiting to come from the crash in India. This also internationally comes at a time where many of the airline operators as well as manufacturers like Boeing are gearing up to head to this International Air Show as well in Paris. How does this perhaps change some of the conversations that take place if if at all? .Well, it it depends on what they were planning to do. If they were doing a a giant, you know, corkscrew flyby of a 787, I think that's canceled right now for that air show. But I think the bottom line of it there it's basically a show and tell of order books. So I don't think it'll have much effect on it at all and Boeing's been through this kind of thing before. You just don't keep bringing it up and bringing it up. So I I think for Boeing sales, it's not going to have an effect unless we find out something catastrophic and I don't think we will. .What are some of the first questions that you imagine regulators and those who are investigating will need to bring to light and hopefully the public get some more answers around? .Well, I think in this case, I mean, they're reportedly, uh the crew did call back with a Mayday saying, we've lost power. And it looked like, you know, from the videos, it's like candid camera everywhere nowadays. It it sort of this pancaked into the neighborhood. So they'll be looking at things like fuel, they'll be looking at things like pilot records, they'll be looking at maintenance records. I'm I say will be, I'll guarantee you they're doing it right now. .Mike, thanks so much for monitoring this story and joining us this morning on short notice as well. .My pleasure, sir. Thank you.

The PPI report follows May consumer price data that showed a fourth month of tame inflation. While the impact of higher tariffs has so far been modest for Americans, economists see price pressures building in the second half of 2025 as companies look to guard against further margin weakness.

In the future, more robotic spacecraft would arrive to sweep up the capsules and rocket them back to Earth, where scientists could look for signs that Mars once was, or is, a world with life..The wait for answers may be about to get longer. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration would cancel the planned follow-on mission, potentially abandoning the tubes for decades to Martian dust storms..The White House is calling for a roughly 50% cut to NASA’s science spending to $3.9 billion, part of an overall pullback that would deliver the lowest funding level in the agency’s history and kill more more than 40 NASA science missions and projects, according to detailed plans released last month. The Trump administration has also left the agency without a permanent leader and without a vision for how America’s civilian space policy is going to work with US allies and compete with China and other rivals..The cuts would follow a shift in how the American public thinks about space. NASA has long enjoyed a unique place in US culture, with its exploits celebrated by movies, theme parks and merchandise — but companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX have begun to capture more attention..For decades, NASA’s scientific undertakings have provided critical groundwork for researchers seeking to understand the structure of the universe, study how planets form and hunt for evidence that life might exist beyond Earth. Pictures from NASA craft like the Hubble Space Telescope and the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope have inspired and delighted millions..Now, the agency’s position at the vanguard of discovery is facing foreclosure. Among the other programs set to lose funding are a craft already on its way to rendezvous with an asteroid that’s expected to pass close to Earth in 2029, and multiple efforts to map and explore the acidic clouds of Venus.

A single passenger is believed to have survived the crash, according to local media reports. All others are believed to be dead..At least 60 bodies have been recovered from the crash site so far.

""Our technical experts are prepared to assist investigators to understand the circumstances, and a Boeing team stands ready to travel to India."".The biggest challenge for Boeing could be getting lay people to understand that while a jet it made crashed, it is unlikely that Boeing is at fault, said John Nance, an aviation safety expert and former commercial pilot. Of course, accident investigators will consider every possibility, he added..With public perception of the planemaker still on shaky ground, that will fall to Boeing executives to address. Ortberg has been trying to move the company past a series of regulatory and safety crises, and was heading into the Paris Air Show after a busy month that included more than 300 new orders and a ramp-up in 737 production..""Previous production issues at Boeing will be very much on people’s minds at the moment and the relatively new leadership at Boeing needs to be visible in the days to come,"" said Paul Charles, CEO of the PC Agency, a London-based luxury travel consultancy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-shares-fall-plane-crashes-094333806.html,Operational Risk Reputational Risk Financial Risk

On June 9, RBC Capital Markets maintained an Outperform rating on Boeing and lifted the price target from $200 to $230. RBC analyst Ken Herbert noted positive solid market sentiment ahead of an upcoming airshow and a solid estimate for future free cash flow (FCF) as the primary contributors to Boeing’s stock performance..The company management as of late issued optimistic statements about the 737 MAX aircraft, and the projected widebody deliveries for May seemed robust. Moreover, Boeing’s forecasted free cash flow for 2027-2028 is expected to fall between  $10-$12 billion, which can potentially improve investor sentiment..Jirat Teparaksa/Shutterstock.com.Despite the favorable outlook, the analyst pointed out that the capacity of the supply chain to maintain larger production rates poses a huge risk for The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). However, the projected shift to a production rate of 42 units monthly for the 737 MAX is considered viable given the presently towering inventory levels..The updated price target at $230 is calculated by applying 21.1x multiple to RBC Capital Markets’ 2027 FCF projection for Boeing of approximately $8.5 billion.

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Boeing (BA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this airplane builder have returned +6.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.9% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Boeing belongs, has gained 7.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Boeing is expected to post a loss of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.8%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.75 points to a change of +91.4%. from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.1%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 indicates a change of +269.8% from what Boeing is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Boeing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-ba-trending-stock-130004062.html,No risk.

The EU believes the US is seeking one-sided concessions and any agreement will likely be asymmetrical to Washington’s benefit..Because of that the bloc is stepping up preparations for counter-measures, including actions that could go beyond tariffs, according to the people. The commission will be consulting with member states to examine strategic areas where the US relies on the EU for possible retaliation..As part of proposals shared with the US late last month, the EU has offered to gradually work toward zero-for-zero tariffs on cars, industrial goods and non-sensitive agricultural goods by looking at quotas as interim steps, Bloomberg reported earlier.

Airline traffic remains solid globally, particularly in Asia-Pacific ex-China, with available seat kilometer (ASK) growth of 5-6% this year expected to absorb most aircraft deliveries through 2026..Operating profits were better year-on-year for most North American and Asian carriers in Q4 and Q1, according to Bernstein, adding that while European low-cost carriers were weaker in Q1, there is no reason for concern, especially with heavy maintenance backlogs at MRO shops..The analyst sees strong demand outpacing supply at Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), constrained by production challenges including supply chain issues and prior shutdowns on models such as the 737 MAX and 787. Boeing is seen to have more near-term upside due to its recovery trajectory, while Airbus faces pressure to meet second-half 2025 delivery targets for the A320 and A350..In the engine aftermarket, high utilization rates for CFM56 and V2500 engines are driving demand for life extensions and spares.

A big chunk of that momentum came during former President Donald Trump's Middle East visit, where Boeing's jets once again became a centerpiece in international dealmaking. The headline order? A massive 150-jet deal from Qatar Airways, including 120 Dreamliners and 30 777X widebodies.

The award has been provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA..The contract, valued at $37.4 million, is slated to be completed by March 2027. According to the agreement, Boeing will repair 109 horizontal stabilizers used on the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft.The work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL, and St. Louis, MO..Rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes, along with rapid technological advancements in combat jets, have led nations to increase their defense spending on combat-proven jets, which constitute an integral part of their defense structure, over the past decade.This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 4.7% for the global military aviation market during the 2025-2030 period. These projections indicate significant growth opportunities for prominent aircraft manufacturers like Boeing, with its military jet portfolio consisting of combat-proven aircraft, such as the F-15EX, P-8, T-7A Red Hawk and C-17 Globemaster III.In particular, Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet provides cutting-edge, next-generation multi-role strike fighter capabilities and serves as the backbone of the U.S. Navy carrier air wing. The company’s EA-18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack platform and the only one currently in production. It offers improved survivability and electronic protection for ground, air and maritime combat troops..Other aerospace companies that are likely to benefit from the expanding global military aviation market are discussed below:Northrop Grumman Corp.

It builds some of the world’s most advanced aircraft, like the E-2C Hawkeye 2000, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, F-5 Tiger Fighter Jet and many more.Northrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 2.8%.Lockheed Martin Corp.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .Spirit AeroSystems is planning to furlough more workers at its Wichita, Kansas, facility starting this week, the company said in an email Monday..The temporary layoffs will impact approximately 300 employees and will last two to three weeks, Spirit AeroSystems spokesperson Joe Buccino said in an email..The latest round of furloughs adds to last month’s temporary layoffs for 300 workers, which Buccino said Spirit AeroSystems has already completed, as well as the 700 workers furloughed back in October 2024..Workers at the Wichita plant are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local Lodge 839. Last year, the company and union inked a new four-year contract after a short strike caused a temporary work stoppage at the Wichita plant..The labor union sent a letter to Wichita worker members as IAM representatives addressed rumors of more furloughs, the Machinist union said in an email Tuesday. The furloughs will “primarily be felt” in the 737 fabrication and composite fabrication departments, as well as some employees in the 737 pylons area, IAM said in the June 5 letter..“We have raised concerns with the company about the short notice for our members, lack of effective communication, and more,” IAM said in a statement. “In Wichita, we know how integral the aerospace industry is to our entire community. These are family-sustaining careers that our members count on to make a good living.”.Spirit AeroSystems has been having financial difficulties over the past year. Spirit AeroSystems ended 2024 with a $2.14 billion net loss. The company’s first quarter net revenue dropped 11% year over year to $1.5 billion..The losses were primarily due to production and delivery changes implemented by its largest customer, Boeing, as the company has been addressing production deficiencies and safety issues since last year’s Alaska Airlines 737-9 Max plane door plug blowout incident..As part of those efforts, Boeing told the fuselage supplier it would no longer accept deliveries of product that required out-of-sequence assembly or incremental quality rework, according to a May 1 securities filing. As a result, Spirit AeroSystems incurred higher factory costs to upkeep the facility to continue production..Boeing also worked through a nearly two-month-long workers’ strike at its Washington and Oregon facilities, which manufacture the bulk of its commercial aircraft. The strike ended in November 2024, but Boeing’s West Coast facilities did not restart production until December.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spirit-aerosystems-furlough-more-workers-114045392.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk Reputational Risk

And if the damage done so far is any indication, the scars will prove more enduring — no matter the outcome of trade talks in London that will continue into a second day on Tuesday..From higher education to jet engines, the scope of connections between the world’s two biggest economies that they are weaponizing — or threatening to use as leverage in negotiations — is also much broader than last time. That could also make a deal more complex to navigate..“The US side has bundled together too many problems with the trade and economic agenda,” said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “I don’t believe that achieving a comprehensive package agreement through just one or two rounds of dialogue is realistic.”.Here are all the ways the US and China are trying to gain leverage:.US Visas.One tool the US has wielded this time is the threat of pulling the visas of the 270,000 Chinese students studying in the US. Late last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Chinese students’ visas would be “aggressively” revoked, including for people with connections to the Communist Party or studying in critical fields. Future applications from China and Hong Kong will also face heightened scrutiny, he said..Following the call with President Xi Jinping last week, Trump then said it would an “honor” to have Chinese students in the US, although it’s far from clear what that will mean in practice..Jet Engines, Chip Design Software.Before Trump returned to the Oval Office last January, the US had already imposed increasingly wide-ranging sanctions on various Chinese people and companies.

Since taking over, Ortberg has steadied the production line, particularly the embattled 737 Max, and helped rebuild investor confidencereflected in a 22% rally in the stock this year. But with lingering safety concerns, regulatory scrutiny, and $1.1 billion paid to avoid prosecution over prior crashes, the shadow of Boeing's past still looms large. As Ortberg heads to the Paris Air Show, he faces a pivotal test of Boeing's progress and promises..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BA..Ortberg is leaning into his supplier background to reset Boeing's frayed industrial relationships. He's publicly criticized the company's aggressive Partnering for Success program that left vendors squeezed and soured. Now, with FAA-imposed production caps and rising delivery pressure, rebuilding trust with suppliers is essential if Boeing wants to scale outputand cash flow. May marked the first time since 2020 that Boeing produced 38 Max jets in a single month, but future rate increases still hinge on regulatory greenlights. Meanwhile, industry leaders cautiously believe Boeing is turning the corner, but note that execution, not words, will be the true signal..Still, culture may be the hardest fix. A recent employee survey revealed a steep drop in morale and trust in leadership compared to a decade ago. Ortberg is moving the needle, instituting new values, mandating executive accountability, and committing to worker engagementincluding direct union meetings with leadership. But critics argue change has been too slow, and victim families from the Max crashes continue to challenge Boeing's legal settlement in court, calling it a cost of doing business.
