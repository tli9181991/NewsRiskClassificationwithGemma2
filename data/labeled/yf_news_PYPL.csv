We are watching Salesforce, PayPal, Block, and CoreWeave. First up, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says that 30 to 50% of the company's work is being done by artificial intelligence. This move to embrace AI that led to the software company cutting over 1,000 positions this year to make room for the technology. Cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike and other tech companies are making similar decisions to embrace AI. Let's bring back in Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member, back in for this. Okay, we were talking about some of these cuts as well and the move towards AI, how that's impacting not just head count, but the productivity gains that we're seeing across some organizations. It seems like another similar story. .Yeah, there's no question about it. I I think again that the the where you want to be focused in the second half is not the obvious AI plays. It's in it's in the Brad Jacobs of the world like the GXO Logistics with the robotics A, with the uh QXO with the building supply, applying these technologies. You know, Brad Jacobs bought Beacon Roofing Supply and he paid 11 times EBITDA and everyone's like, oh, isn't he like a smart value guy? Uh he kind of overpaid because he needed a platform company. He goes, no, no, no. We're going to double we're going to implement these technologies and we are going to double EBITDA over the next few years. So he effectively paid five times EBITDA and you're going to see more and more of this in boring industrial companies, in consumer products companies, uh and the like. So so this is the next theme to pay attention to, not to discount the benefits and and the NVIDIAs of the world will continue to do great. But to look for like where can I get doubles and triples, not incremental growth of things that have already run up. .But I mean, when Mark Benioff says something like this, does it essentially signal that there is even more productivity that they can extract from the AI use cases that they're already seeing internally at their companies and the number of other major software companies out there that are trying to do the same thing while also selling solutions to their customer base. .Look, when Mark Benioff talks, you have to listen, okay? And if he's doing it in his own company, guess what the next step is. He's going to be doing it for all the other consumers, the clients of Salesforce and helping them to become more productive. But on in the short term, it looks like a panic. It's like, oh, everyone's going to lose their job. In the long term, what we know is all these new technologies create new cottage industries, create new jobs, create new opportunities. So in the short term there is some dislocation, increase productivity for sure. In the intermediate and long term, it creates new industries, it creates new servicing, it creates new things that we don't even know that we don't know. Uh and that's just the beauty of progress. .Next up here, I want to talk about cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announcing a peer-to-peer payment app, putting it in competition with Block owned Cash App and PayPal owned Venmo. We're seeing those stocks edge lower on this news and this new platform will allow transfers of crypto and fiat currencies in an effort to further expand Kraken's business to more than just digital asset trading here. I think this directly speaks to how much of the mindset among the not even just the crypto curious, but the crypto core out there that are holders and holders of crypto long-term that have already recognized how much they engage with some of the newer platforms like a Kraken versus some of the legacy platforms. Yes, we can call them legacy at this point in PayPal and in uh of course Square or Block. Um .Look, this is just a headline. Okay, Crack Kraken, I mean, uh Cash App is a lower quality business. Block is a lower quality business. PayPal is a superlative business. We own PayPal. 453 million users, they're generating record free cash flow, they're buying in 20% of their stock. By the way, they're the sixth largest issuer of stable coins. So they are in the game. They just announced the deal with the Big 12 where the players are going to take their their payments uh uh through PayPal, through Venmo. That's going to create a and you're going to get your team cards, team credit cards, team bonuses. That's going to create a lot of buzz around the millennials and and around the Gen Z. So yes, Kraken's getting in the game, but no, they don't have 450 million active users, two decades of brand equity, uh comfort, uh etc. and Alex Chris who ran uh the business division for into it, which was a monster multibagger. He's applying his innovation to small business at PayPal. It's just early days for the new PayPal since he's come in in just over a year. .Finally here, we got to talk CoreWeave. CoreWeave CEO is now among one of the richest executives in the world after the company's meteoric 300% surge. CoreWeave is now one of the 30 best performing stocks on the Nasdaq since its public offering. Taking a look at shares here, adding on about 7/10s, 8/10s of a percent in a move higher here on the day. But if you were to fire up the Yahoo Finance platform and go towards a longer term look since this company went public and this is not even factoring in the day one pop, I don't think, 302% moved to the upside and that happened just earlier this year as well. And so this really getting us back into the mind frame of what the appetite for investors and the clamoring among investors for new names who can show profitability or show a pathway towards getting to sustain profitability making their market debut is actually is right now. .Yeah, look, there's pent up demand and uh Wall Street's very good when the ducks are quack and you feed them. So right now, CoreWeave is the only place to put your money if you want to get some of this action. Uh in the next few months you're going to see dozens and dozens and dozens of opportunities that dilute the CoreWeaves of the world, which is a GPU reseller. Uh and uh and you're going to see uh um a little bit more moderation in those those price increases. .The ducks are quacking, you feed them. All right, cool. Go feed them on a different side of the lake, not where the fish are because that's where we're fishing. Thanks so much.

While analysts currently project a 5.7% annual revenue growth over the next three years and earnings of US$5.5 billion by 2028, these strategic initiatives could influence such projections. Speculatively, if successful, these developments might narrow the current share price discount to the analyst price target of US$82.32, which stands 17.3% above the current share price. Investors might find PayPal's forward-looking strategies compelling, should they translate into tangible financial growth..In light of our recent valuation report, it seems possible that PayPal Holdings is trading behind its estimated value.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-nasdaqgs-pypl-enhances-173617916.html,No risk.

2025-06-25 22:44:00,COIN vs. PYPL: Which Crypto Payments Stock is the Better Option Now?,"COIN and PYPL push deeper into stablecoins and crypto payments, but one shows stronger financial momentum and growth.","Retail access to cryptocurrencies is steadily improving as platforms streamline onboarding, optimize user experiences and align more closely with regulatory standards. Fintech firms and exchanges are increasingly integrating crypto wallets and trading capabilities within their apps, simplifying digital asset management for everyday users. In this context, let’s find out which of these two companies is better poised, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN or PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL.Stablecoins, which bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space, are gaining importance in shaping the digital financial system. In fact, major banks are also exploring their own stablecoin initiatives.  With tokenization, stablecoins and DeFi, retail users are set to gain access to a wider array of user-friendly and functional crypto services beyond basic trading.Yet, cyber threats remain a challenge. But as an investment option, which stock is more attractive? Let’s closely look at the fundamentals of these stocks..Coinbase, the largest registered crypto exchange in the United States, is well-positioned to capitalize on increased market volatility and rising digital asset prices. The company is also set to benefit from President Trump’s favorable stance on cryptocurrency and his push for regulatory clarity. With 83% of its revenues coming from the United States, Coinbase is strongly aligned with a domestic market that is increasingly viewed as a future global leader in crypto innovation.In 2024, the company more than doubled its total revenues and recorded its second straight year of positive adjusted EBITDA. This growth was largely driven by increased transaction revenues from higher trading volumes and expanded market share in the United States. Coinbase is also prioritizing real-world crypto adoption through key infrastructure investments such as Base — a cost-efficient Layer 2 scaling solution — and a growing focus on stablecoins. These moves reinforce its strategic vision to serve as the primary platform for businesses integrating digital assets.From a financial perspective, Coinbase remains strong, closing 2024 with $9.3 billion in USD resources, including cash, cash equivalents, and USDC, up $3.8 billion year over year. The company has also lowered its debt load, with healthier debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios signaling solid financial management and repayment capacity.Nevertheless, rising transaction and operating expenses continue to put pressure on profit margins. It also remains highly exposed to volatility in the value of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A significant price drop could hurt earnings, reduce the value of crypto held on the balance sheet, and constrain future cash flows, potentially straining liquidity and the ability to meet ongoing obligations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coin-vs-pypl-crypto-payments-144400499.html,Market Risk Regulatory Risk Operational Risk

But there is a forthcoming exchange-traded fund, seeking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval, that would invest in short-term consumer debt issuers. While there are funds on the market with exposure to the likes of PayPal and Affirm, ones concentrated on the BNPL business are hard to find. The VegaShares Buy Now, Pay Later ETF would seek out financial-industry securities based on assessments of issuers’ competitive positions, risk management, leverage, and price relative to peers, according to the initial prospectus filed earlier this month..The ETF may have to answer at least two questions, said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas. One of which is whether the timing is right: is the launch coming at an advantageous time in the economic cycle? The other, he said, “is anyone going to want to buy this in bulk, particularly in the competitive ETF space?”.READ ALSO: The Rise of the Buffer ETF and RFG’s Bluemonte Jumps Into ETFs.The BNPL business comes with some baggage and a pretty big stigma. While it makes money, it’s hard to argue that it operates in the best interest of consumers. The services have grown in popularity over a decade in the US, particularly among people who are the least financially equipped to borrow, according to a paper last month by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. “Although BNPL services may help some consumers manage financial constraints by breaking down purchases into smaller installments and providing access to interest-free credit, the smaller, interest-free installments may also lead some consumers to perceive purchases as more affordable than they really are, increasing the risk of overspending, debt accumulation, and even default,” authors Fumiko Hayashi and Aditi Routh wrote..High percentages of people who have used BNPL services have not fared well, data from a recent Motley Fool study show:.Nearly a quarter, 24%, of such borrowers were late on payments last year, up from 18% in 2023..Fifty-eight percent borrowed for purchases they otherwise couldn’t afford, and 40% said they regretted using buy now, pay later after understanding the full costs..Paying the Price: Still, it’s a market that is drawing investors. Prudential’s PGIM unit is buying up as much as $500 million in consumer debt from Affirm over three years, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The prospectus for the VegaShares Buy Now, Pay Later ETF did not yet identify the fund’s advisor, and the law firm representing it did not comment, citing company policy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-buy-now-pay-later-101000368.html,Reputational Risk

(PYPL) on Emerging Value’s Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on PYPL. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)'s share was trading at $74.61 as of 11th June. PYPL’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.77 and 15.13 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com.PayPal’s Q1 2025 results delivered a mixed bag: revenue grew only 1%, TPV (Total Payment Volume) dropped 7% to 6.0 billion, though excluding the low-margin PSP segment, TPV rose 6%. Active accounts ticked up 2% to 436 million, a modest gain that softens enthusiasm. However, the bright spots: GAAP operating income jumped 31% to $1.5 billion and operating margin expanded nearly 450 bps to 19.6%..The most profitable branded checkout (+6% TPV) and Venmo (+10%) segments are delivering strong volume growth, while PSP growth has slowed to 2% as PayPal trims its unprofitable Braintree business. Transaction margin rose 7%, fueling a 17% increase in value-added services revenue, driven by credit offerings and nascent ad products..Looking ahead, Q2 EPS is guided to $1.29–$1.31 (+9%), with full‑year non-GAAP EPS growth forecast at 6–10%. Management positioned this conservatively, likely to under-promise and over-deliver. Opex cuts—particularly in support and admin—will moderate in 2025, while a $6 billion buyback (≈7% of market cap) bolsters EPS, though tax rate increases to 25% dampen net gains..Strategically, PayPal is shifting from commoditized payments to a broader commerce platform, monetizing through credits, ads, AI-powered “agentic commerce,” B2B offerings, and “Fastlane” checkout. These initiatives aim to increase take‑rates and attach more services per user. While most effects won’t show until 2026+, the company’s strong unit economics, operating leverage, and strategic repositioning point to sustainable EPS growth—possibly in the low teens..If PayPal sustains 12% growth and re-rates to ~20x, its ~2027 EPS of ~$6.40 gives a potential stock price around $128, compared to today’s ~$73. This presents a compelling long-term upside..We previously covered a bullish thesis on PayPal (PYPL) that emphasized its accelerating transaction margins, AI-driven innovation, and momentum in high-value segments like BNPL, Venmo, and value-added services. The stock has appreciated by approximately 12.5 % since our coverage. A complementary view from Emerging Value echoes this optimism while adding a valuation-focused lens.

During this period, PayPal shares have improved 3.1%..Localized Innovation with Strategic Infrastructure Control: StoneCo is capitalizing on Brazil’s accelerating digital payments adoption by combining deep local expertise with relentless product innovation. From launching features like Pix Troco (QR-code cash withdrawal) to expanding its own acquiring infrastructure, the company is enhancing customer experience while gaining operational control. Its full-stack platform and regional focus position it to ride long-term structural tailwinds in financial inclusion and SME digitization..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Disciplined Capital Deployment and Robust Shareholder Returns: Having identified R$3 billion in excess capital at the close of 2024, StoneCo has already returned approximately R$1 billion year to date through aggressive share repurchases.

PayPal’s branded checkout experience is being modernized at scale, now powering 45% of U.S. volume and more than half in Europe, leading to better conversion and reduced friction.

Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days..Bitcoin Rebounds After Ceasefire Announcement .Bitcoin fell below $100,000 early Monday for the first time in 45 days after the United States bombed Iranian nuclear sites, fueling fears that the ongoing tensions could last for a longer period. The fears escalated after Iran retaliated by attacking U.S. airbases in Qatar and Iraq..However, Bitcoin made a solid rebound late Monday after Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The cryptocurrency briefly surpassed $106,000 before giving up some of the gains and was hovering around $105,700, with its market cap standing at $2.1 trillion..The Middle East crisis has been weighing on the cryptocurrency market, but Bitcoin has managed to hold its ground..The Bitcoin rally has faced challenges, but has not come to a halt. There have been profit bookings, but it has continued to trade with solid gains. While the ceasefire announcement alleviated immediate concerns over disruptions in oil supply, investors are also waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech..Investors have lately been optimistic about the Fed resuming its rate cuts in the coming weeks as inflation has been showing signs of cooling over the past three months. Experts believe that a rate cut in the coming weeks could boost Bitcoin to $107,000 and put it on track to surpass $120,000..Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Friday that a rate cut could come as early as July..Trade tensions have also eased substantially over the past few weeks, with the United States and China reaching a trade deal earlier this month. Negotiations with several other nations are ongoing, and more trade deals are likely to be announced in the near term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-crypto-centric-stocks-watch-121100689.html,Market Risk
2025-06-24 12:01:00,Fiserv Connecting Thousands of Banks to Crypto with New Stablecoin Platform,Financial institutions are racing to get into stablecoins as the Genius Act makes its way toward POTUS Trump’s desk.,"Welcome to the cryptoverse, Main Street. Fintech company Fiserv said yesterday it’s launching a stablecoin platform that will connect thousands of banks and merchants later this year..Fiserv is building the platform, which’ll live on the Solana blockchain, with help from blockchain infrastructure company Paxos and stablecoin platform Circle. Fiserv is also launching its own stablecoin to use on the platform, FIUSD, but plans to make the platform compatible with other tokens, too, like PayPal’s PayUSD..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Stablecoins are the California rolls of the crypto world. They’re a starting point to get cautious financial institutions to try a little crypto. The tokens are seen as safer than other digital assets (ahem, fartcoin) because their value is tied 1:1 with another asset, often the US dollar..Companies are racing to get into stablecoins as the Genius Act makes its way toward POTUS Trump’s desk. The bill, which outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoins, was passed by the Senate in an overwhelming 68-30 vote last week. It heads to the House next and, if approved there, to Trump for a final signature. Trump posted on social media last week that he wants it on his desk “ASAP – NO DELAYS.” He said the bill will “make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets.”.As businesses eye the new legislation, they’re exploring how they can ride the hype:.Some of the largest US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, are considering teaming up to launch a joint stablecoin, according to The Wall Street Journal. For now, JPMorgan said it’s launching a stablecoin-like “deposit token” called JPMD on Coinbase’s blockchain..Walmart, Amazon and Expedia are reportedly exploring the launch of their own stablecoins, which could enable shoppers to bypass traditional payment platforms and pay through the blockchain..If You Can’t Beat ’Em: Stablecoins pose an existential threat to traditional finance because they let consumers bypass banks, instead processing transactions on the blockchain. So TradFi (crypto-speak for Traditional Finance) companies are getting ahead of the trend with their own platforms and stablecoins, ensuring they’ll still be a part of people’s purchases, even if they move to the blockchain. Proponents also say stablecoins make transactions faster and cheaper, but skeptics remain concerned about security and possible regulatory complications..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

2025-06-24 02:30:00,How Fiserv jolts the bank stablecoin market,"The financial technology seller plans its own coin and interoperability with PayPal's PYUSD, potentially reaching millions of consumers and merchants and thousands of banks.","The advancement of the GENIUS Act has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight, with Fiserv being the latest firm to enter the market, hoping to reach a wide range of financial institutions that face pressure from fintechs and large banks..Fiserv said it would launch a digital asset platform, including a stablecoin, FIUSD, that will be part of Fiserv's banking and payments menu by the end of 2025. Additionally, the bank technology company and PayPal plan to make their stablecoins, FIUSD and PYUSD, interoperable..Both of these moves, announced Monday morning, would add drastic scale, opening stablecoins to thousands of financial institutions and PayPal's base of more than 430 million consumers and 36 million merchants. It also joins a fast-growing market of stablecoin issuers that includes a consortium of large banks, major retailers such as Amazon and Walmart and early mover banks such as Societe Generale and Vantage Bank..""Not having a stablecoin is like not having a Rolex years back,"" Elias Ghanem, global head of Capgemini Research Institute for Financial Services, told American Banker. ""Announcement doesn't mean adoption, but early adopters, early launchers, will have higher adoption."".With stablecoins, part of the battle is to quickly build a base of users to juice network externalities. Fiserv has more than 10,000 financial-institution clients, processes more than 90 billion transactions each year and has more than 6 million merchant locations..Fiserv plans to make FIUSD available through its existing payment technology at no added cost. FIUSD will use stablecoin infrastructure from Paxos and Circle, and will make the stablecoin available on the Solana blockchain..""Together with our other cloud-native banking and merchant platforms, we believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem,"" Takis Georgakopoulos, chief operating officer of Fiserv, said in a release. Fiserv did not respond to a request for comment.Nonbank issuers have dominated the stablecoin market, a trend threatening traditional bank deposits if the stablecoin market were to grow dramatically. The expectation that banks will need to respond provides a potential way for Fiserv to expand its client relationships by supporting banks' issuance of FIUSD and by enabling banks to use Fiserv's digital asset platform to issue their own branded stablecoins..""After the GENIUS Act was passed last week, we expected to see a flurry of announcements,"" Gareth Lodge, an analyst at Celent, told American Banker, adding that integrating the stablecoin into Fiserv's existing offerings for banks and merchants is ""a huge step forward and democratizes the opportunity.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fiserv-jolts-bank-stablecoin-market-183000490.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Technology Risk Regulatory Risk Competition Risk

PayPal is still a big name, but competition is eating into its core checkout business. Apple Pay and Shop Pay are crowding the space. Meanwhile, broader economic pressure isn’t helping..The analyst doesn’t dismiss the changes PayPal’s new management is trying, like improving the checkout process and pushing out Fastlane, but they’re not convinced the payoff will be worth it. They’re forecasting just 2% annual profit growth through 2027. That’s less than half of what most analysts expect..Image by mohamed Hassan from Pixabay.PayPal’s numbers aren’t terrible. Revenue grew 4.8% over the past year, and the company still scores well on financial health. But its current valuation doesn’t match its near-term outlook. The price-to-earnings ratio looks high considering what it’s likely to earn going forward..The analysts also flagged PayPal’s growing lending business. Loans on the books jumped 31% YoY in Q1 2025. That might look like a growth story now, but Truist thinks it could turn into a liability by 2026..To wrap it up, they suggest looking elsewhere.

Monee delivered a standout performance in the first quarter of 2025, with revenues surging 57.6% year over year to $787.1 million, outpacing both Shopee and Garena, which posted gains of 28.3% and 8.2%, respectively. This rapid growth was fueled by a $5.8 billion loan book and strong traction in emerging markets. Monee’s expansion into Brazil, one of South America’s most underserved credit markets, signals a strategic pivot toward sustainable growth.Now among Southeast Asia’s largest unsecured consumer lenders, Monee draws most of its revenues from consumer and SME credit. In the last reported quarter, SE added more than 4 million first-time borrowers, with active loan users exceeding 28 million, representing 50% year-over-year growth. Despite this rapid expansion, Monee has maintained a stable portfolio health, with a 90-day non-performing loans ratio of 1.1%.As the division scales, the company continues to prioritize risk management through a proactive, data-driven approach. Deep market penetration and an expanding user base are helping Monee draw on real-time insights from within the SE ecosystem to monitor repayment behaviors and adjust credit policies accordingly. The division is now moving beyond payments and credit to banking, investment and insurance to build a full-fledged financial services platform.Monee’s growth is increasingly driven by its integration with Shopee via SPL (Shopee PayLater), as well as rising traction in non-Shopee channels, particularly its BCL (Buy-Consume-Later) and SPL offline offerings. Together, these trends highlight Monee’s balance of ecosystem synergy and independent growth potential..Sea faces strong competition in digital financial services from Grab Financial GRAB and PayPal PYPL.Grab Financial, through GrabFin and OVO, provides digital payment, lending and insurance services across Southeast Asia.

Venmo, the company’s peer-to-peer payment platform, continues to drive significant TPV growth. PayPal’s edge lies in its brand trust, merchant network and fraud prevention tech.

As of this writing, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has delivered a total return of 10.5% over the last 12 months. Indications that inflation might be moderating and hopes that interest rates will come down have played a big role in the gains..Even more than businesses in other sectors, the outlook for financial companies hinges heavily on macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate policy..With that in mind, read on to see why two Fool.com contributing analysts identified these discounted stocks as top ways to play different potential outcomes on the interest rate front..Image source: Getty Images..Keith Noonan (PayPal): Despite some solid gains for the broader financials sector across 2025's trading, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock is down roughly 17% year to date. Similarly striking, the company's share price is also down roughly 77% from the lifetime high it hit in 2021 amid pandemic-driven demand and favorable catalysts for financial stocks connected to the low-interest rate environment..While more competitors have moved into the payments and financial services space, PayPal still occupies a strong position in the industry. And while there have been a significant number of fast-growing upstarts in the space, few come close to matching PayPal's financial foundations and track record of dependable operational results..Admittedly, PayPal's total revenue increased just 1% year over year to $7.8 billion in this year's first quarter. Meanwhile, total payment volume conducted across its platforms rose 3% annually to $417.2 billion..On the other hand, the company has continued to do an impressive job with cost-reduction initiatives. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share for the period actually increased 23% year over year to hit $1.33. The company also closed the quarter out with $15.8 billion in cash against $12.6 billion in debt, even after returning $1.5 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks in the quarter..Despite some promising signs that its growth and turnaround initiatives in key business areas are moving in the right direction, PayPal stock is still trading at just 13.5 times this year's expected earnings. With a feasible path for the Fed to deliver at least one interest rate cut later this year, the company could soon be seeing a more favorable operating and valuation backdrop. Looking further out, there seems to be a good chance that President Donald Trump will move to replace current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in 2026 with a new leader who is more amenable to lowering rates.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-down-77-19-084000804.html,No risk.
2025-06-21 21:00:00,Why PayPal Stock Is a Screaming Buy for the Second Half of 2025,PayPal stock has fallen almost 20% for the year and now trades at attractive valuations.,"PayPal stock (PYPL) has had a bumpy ride since 2020. The stock more than doubled in 2020 and continued its good run in the first half of 2021. However, PYPL ended that year in the red, meeting the same fate for the next two years. 2024 was a welcome break for PayPal investors as the “law of averages” finally caught up with the stock, and it gained a respectable 39%, outperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) after three consecutive years of underperformance..Cut to 2025, and PYPL stock has already lost nearly 20% and is yet again massively underperforming the broader market, which has recovered from its April lows. I see the recent fall in PayPal stock as a good buying opportunity, as we’ll explore in this article..Robotaxis, Powell and Other Key Things to Watch this Week.Make Over a 2.4% One-Month Yield Shorting Nvidia Out-of-the-Money Puts.Is Quantum Computing (QUBT) Stock a Buy on This Bold Technological Breakthrough?.Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!.PayPal started the year on a strong note but fell sharply after its Q4 2024 earnings. While the company posted better-than-expected revenues and profits for the quarter, and its guidance came in ahead of estimates, slowing growth at Braintree, its subsidiary focused on card processing, dampened sentiment..The tariff chaos did not help, as fintech companies, including Affirm (AFRM) and PayPal, slumped in April amid concerns that tariffs could lead to a recession, hurting their business. Both these stocks have not yet recovered to their 2025 highs, even as tariff worries have greatly (if not fully) subsided..While these are short-term headwinds, PayPal is facing some structural challenges in the form of higher competition across nearly all its business verticals. For instance, its branded checkout is facing intense competition from Apple Pay (AAPL) and Google Pay (GOOG), while the non-branded business faces competition from companies like Stripe. The P2P business is also facing competition from Zelle and Cash App (XYZ)..The competition has negatively impacted PayPal’s topline, which is now growing in single digits. With rising competition, digital payment companies have been feeling pressure on their take rate (the fees they charge for processing the transaction), and PayPal’s operating margins have fallen..While I find corporate turnarounds a cliché, PayPal is a legit turnaround story under the new CEO, Alex Chriss, who is working on profitable growth. The strategy has shown results, and the company has had five consecutive quarters of profitable growth. PayPal has also made a foray into digital advertising, capitalizing on the vast consumer data that it possesses. The company is also using artificial intelligence to personalize experiences for customers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-paypal-stock-screaming-buy-130002500.html,No risk.

2025-06-20 21:00:00,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know","Paypal (PYPL) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 6.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%..The consensus earnings estimate of $5.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.64 indicates a change of +10.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-attracting-130002124.html,No risk.

Circle (CRCL), issuer of the USDC stablecoin, also surged 25% to a fresh record..The company's move aligns with the growing trend of stablecoins reshaping the global payments market. Payments companies such as Stripe and PayPal debut products that use blockchain tech under the hood for payments. Meanwhile, crypto native companies like USDC issuer Circle with its payment network are also entering the increasingly competitive field..It's still an enticing opportunity: Coinbase said that stablecoins facilitated $30 trillion in transactions last year, tripling the volume year-over-year..The new service integrates three modular components: The Stablecoin Checkout lets customers pay using wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, and Coinbase Wallet in a gasless, browser-native experience. The Ecommerce Engine gives platforms an API to handle key functions like authorization, refunds and ledgering. And the Commerce Payments Protocol executes transactions through smart contracts, handling mechanics like delayed capture or onchain escrow..In practice, this means merchants can accept USDC from global customers at any time of day, without any additional setup and lower transaction costs.

However, the rally has been threatened over the last few days by heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, with the United States now being gradually dragged into it..However, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential and is expected to continue its northbound journey. Several positive developments on the domestic front are likely to boost the cryptocurrency in the near term..Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely CME Group Inc CME, Visa Inc. V and PayPal Holdings PYPL. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days..President Donald Trump will be leaving the G7 Summit early and rushing back to D.C. amid growing tensions between Iran and Israel, as the United States is now being dragged into the conflict. Israel launched an attack on Iran last week, targeting its nuclear program and military sites..Iran retaliated with a barrage of missiles, and since then, the two nations have been trading missiles. Tensions may escalate over the coming days or till Iran shows interest in resuming nuclear negotiations with the United States..The growing tensions have been weighing on the broader market, and Bitcoin, despite holding above $106,000 on Monday, is feeling the heat. Several market participants believe that the cryptocurrency might drop to $90,000 if the conflict continues..Even if Bitcoin drops to the range of $90,000, the decline will be temporary, which makes it an ideal time to buy the dip. Besides, there have been several positive developments on the domestic front..The United States and China reached a trade deal last week, in a major relief to investors who were concerned that the nation’s economy could slip into a recession owing to Trump’s sweeping tariffs imposed on all trading partners of the United States. Besides, the White House is also holding negotiations with other trading partners and more deals are likely to be announced in the coming days..Inflation has been on the decline lately, which has raised hopes of a rate cut in September. The Federal Reserve paused its rate-cut campaign earlier this year owing to rising inflation. However, inflation has cooled, raising optimism about rate cuts once again..Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is seeing some positive developments in terms of regulations. The GENIUS Act, a proposed law aimed at overseeing stablecoins, recently cleared an important hurdle in the Senate. Also, Trump, along with his crypto and AI advisor David Sacks, has been strongly advocating for crypto-friendly policies, which has helped boost investor confidence in the digital asset space.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-bitcoin-centric-stocks-focus-131900181.html,Market Risk Geopolitical Risk Regulatory Risk

The fintech giant had a distinct advantage over rivals going into the pandemic, but since then it has been searching for a new way forward after growth slowed. It's taking a long time, and investors are losing patience. After some up and down periods, the stock is trading now at roughly the same level it was three years ago, which means none of the actions it has taken have delivered results or impressed the market enough to bring the shares back to life..After the lethargic performance, PayPal stock is trading at a cheap valuation today. Is this an incredible opportunity to buy on the dip and get set up for life?.With 436 million active customers worldwide, PayPal is the leader in digital payments..That gives it a huge opportunity to expand as the share of transactions happening online keeps rising. E-commerce is still growing as a percentage of retail sales, and PayPal is responsible for a percentage of overall payment volume online. Each percentage point increase in digital payment volume amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars, providing organic growth opportunities for PayPal. According to Statista, global digital payments transaction volume is expected to surpass $20 trillion this year and grow at a compound annual rate of 13.6% through 2030..PayPal has lagged during the past few years as younger and more agile companies have released improved payments features that provide better user experiences than PayPal's legacy interface. PayPal responded by hiring a new chief executive officer, Alex Chriss, to fine-tune its strategy and get back in the game. Since he came on board in 2023, PayPal has released many new features to compete, such as one-click checkout and express checkout. The new interface is now available for more than 45% of transactions. Management's new strategy involves a pivot from being a payments company to being a commerce company -- one that provides a more holistic offering for merchants and shoppers, and connects all of its parts for a unified growth model. For example, its Venmo digital payments service is very popular among its users, and PayPal has issued a Venmo debit card to activate that platform for easier use when shopping. The number of active Venmo debit card users increased by 40% year over year in the first quarter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buying-paypal-stock-today-083000775.html,No risk.

This is a group that can sometimes live paycheck to paycheck, and Chime has lots of things that make it attractive to a widening user base, including a compelling fee schedule, flexibility, and the MyPay program that can advance up to $500 from an incoming direct deposit at no cost if it hits the account within 24 hours. Two-thirds of Chime users consider Chime their primary banking account..Chime hit the market at a good time. Revenue growth is accelerating. Its top line rose 27% in 2023 and stepped up to 31% growth last year. The top line came through with a 32% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of this year.

2025-06-14 16:08:00,Congress Is Working on a New Crypto Bill. Here's What Investors Need to Know.,"Stablecoins have exploded in popularity, and are now a $250 billion industry.  Washington lawmakers are in the process of delivering a final piece of stablecoin legislation before the end of the summer.  New legislation should make it more attractive for cryptocurrency investors to get exposure to stablecoins.","Stablecoins have exploded in popularity, and are now a $250 billion industry..Washington lawmakers are in the process of delivering a final piece of stablecoin legislation before the end of the summer..New legislation should make it more attractive for cryptocurrency investors to get exposure to stablecoins..10 stocks we like better than Circle Internet Group ›.In June 2020, the value of the crypto stablecoin industry was $10 billion. Five years later, it's now a $250 billion industry. That makes stablecoins one of the fastest-growing areas of the crypto market right now..In fact, stablecoins have grown so fast and have become so popular that they have attracted the attention of Congress, which is looking for ways to regulate them. There are now two competing pieces of legislation, one in the House and one in the Senate, and the goal is to have a final bill passed before the end of the summer..For crypto investors, this new legislation could have important consequences. In theory, it should make stablecoins much more approachable for the average investor. And it will help to define how stablecoins fit into the world of traditional finance. If Congress is interested in this new stablecoin trend, then you need to be aware of it as well..Before digging into the new stablecoin legislation, it's important to understand what stablecoins are, and how they work. Most stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to the value of the U.S. dollar. As a result, many refer to them as ""digital dollars."" In theory, you can always exchange $1 worth of stablecoins for $1 in cash. That's what makes them so valuable: They are the easiest way to move between the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain finance..Right now, two stablecoins -- Tether (CRYPTO: USDT) and USDC (CRYPTO: USDC) -- account for approximately 85% of the value of the stablecoin market. But there are plenty of new, up-and-coming stablecoins, including one that has been issued by World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture affiliated with the Trump family..To give you an idea of just how big stablecoins have become, of the top 50 cryptocurrencies (as ranked by market cap), five of them are now stablecoins. The easiest way to spot them is by looking for cryptos trading at a price of exactly $1..In order for stablecoin legislation to be signed into law by President Trump later this summer, congressional lawmakers need to settle their differences about what should be included in the final bill..At the beginning of this year, this seemed like an easy thing to do. But if you've been following all the ruckus around the ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" it is now obvious that getting the House and Senate to agree on anything these days is challenging. When you add in the fact that a Trump-affiliated crypto venture (World Liberty Financial) is now an emerging player in the stablecoin industry, things get even more complicated.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-working-crypto-bill-heres-080800929.html,Regulatory Risk

The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.13%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 1.79%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.3%..The technology platform and digital payments company's shares have seen an increase of 4.53% over the last month, surpassing the Business Services sector's gain of 0.81% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.55%..Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Paypal in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 29, 2025. On that day, Paypal is projected to report earnings of $1.29 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.4%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.12 billion, up 2.93% from the year-ago period..For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.08 per share and a revenue of $32.82 billion, representing changes of +9.25% and +3.22%, respectively, from the prior year..Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential..Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system..The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Right now, Paypal possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold)..In terms of valuation, Paypal is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.72. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 15.91..We can also see that PYPL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial Transaction Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.37 as trading concluded yesterday.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-pypl-sees-more-significant-214505344.html,Market Risk

Shares of other payment companies such as American Express Co., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. also slipped in intraday trading..The sector is being weighed down by a Wall Street Journal report citing unidentified people that Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among companies that have recently discussed issuing their own stablecoins in the US. In addition to large merchants, other multinational giants like airline operators and Expedia Group, Inc. have also considered issuing their own crypto tokens to bypass credit card issuers like Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are usually pegged to a currency like the US dollar so the tokens can be used for payments..Though the news erased more than $60 billion in market value from Visa and Mastercard combined, analysts said now is a good time to snap up the stocks at a discount..“We encourage investors to accumulate shares of Visa and Mastercard on weakness,” Andrew Jeffrey of William Blair wrote in a note, reiterating outperform ratings on both companies..Jeffrey said stablecoins are still not very suitable for business-to-consumer commerce, “even as merchants view them as a potential means of lowering card acceptance costs.”.Consumers are accustomed to using credit and debit cards, habits that won’t soon change, he said, adding that a lack of stablecoin standards can also limit its use. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Diksha Gera said that Friday’s share declines reflect fears that stablecoins could erode volume share and margin, but it’s a premature worry..“Visa and Mastercard have proactively integrated stablecoin capabilities, while lingering trust and regulatory hurdles, along with a prolonged adoption curve by consumers, might impede widespread adoption,” Gera wrote in a note..BMO Capital Markets analyst Rufus Hone agrees that broad-based stablecoin adoption within consumer payments is an unlikely outcome, but said even if the tokens are adopted, Visa and Mastercard are poised to benefit.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/60-billion-visa-mastercard-slump-184854735.html,Operational Risk Market Risk Regulatory Risk

During the last quarter, the company's stock price increased by 9%. This rise was likely influenced by several strategic partnerships, including Selfbook for hotel bookings and a Mastercard collaboration, enhancing PayPal's service integration and brand reach.

Find the list for free..The recent developments at PayPal Holdings, including the collaboration with Input 1, could further facilitate the company's progression towards becoming a comprehensive commerce platform. As PayPal integrates its Digital Wallet for insurance premium payments, user convenience and security are enhanced, potentially driving transaction volumes and strengthening merchant relationships. This move complements PayPal’s ongoing transformation initiatives, which focus on expanding its branded experiences, Venmo benefits, and other value-added services, potentially improving both revenue and earnings in upcoming quarters..Over the last year, which ended on 13th June 2025, PayPal’s total return, combining share price and dividends, reached 21.56%. This performance contrasts with a 1-year underperformance relative to the US Diversified Financial industry, which returned 24.5%. Despite the stock overshadowing the broader US market's one-year return, this discrepancy highlights a complex competitive landscape..The boost in PayPal’s stock price in the recent quarter, driven by collaborations with Selfbook and Mastercard, aligns with analysts forecasting revenue growth at a compound annual rate of 5.7% over the next three years. Analysts foresee earnings growth to US$5.5 billion by 2028, slightly above the current revenue of 31.89 billion and earnings of 4.55 billion. However, these projections are sensitive to macroeconomic challenges and regulatory changes that could impact PayPal’s financial trajectory..The company's current share price of US$68.05, which represents a discount of around 9% to the consensus price target of US$81.74, suggests potential upside, provided that PayPal continues to leverage its commerce platform to enhance earnings and revenue growth effectively. This target reflects expectations of a price-to-earnings ratio alignment with the industry average, offering a potentially compelling case for investors if forecast assumptions materialize as expected.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-nasdaqgs-pypl-expands-172756076.html,No risk.

We’re only in the early stages of exploring the capabilities and applications of AI agents in finance..That was a key takeaway from Fortune’s Emerging CFO event on Thursday, held in partnership with Workday, a sponsor of CFO Daily. My colleague Geoff Colvin and I spoke with Silvio Savarese, EVP and chief scientist at Salesforce AI Research; Jamie Miller, chief financial and operating officer at PayPal; and Matt Castonguay, CFO at Team Car Care, about how their companies are leveraging this technology..“AI agents can act as workflow and workforce multipliers for humans—like having a fleet of agents at your disposal, 24/7,” Savarese said. He described four key components of an agent: memory (for retaining and using information), a brain (for reasoning and planning), actuators (for executing actions via APIs), and sensors or interfaces (for communicating with the outside world)..In finance, Savarese explained, agents can automate and personalize customer interactions in retail banking, streamline processes like mortgage lending, and improve customer satisfaction with faster approvals. He added that agents will soon be able to communicate with each other, requiring new protocols for secure interactions. As compliance frameworks for agentic AI are still evolving, Savarese advised finance leaders to work with legal and risk teams to develop internal policies aligned with upcoming AI accountability standards..At PayPal, Miller said the company targets use cases involving high-volume manual work, such as invoice processing and accruals. Agents can harmonize data from multiple formats and automate tasks like travel and expense compliance by auditing receipts and making recommendations. “As CFOs, we’re responsible for financial statements and compliance, so it’s critical to have the right checks, balances, and oversight,” Miller said. “With the right framework, the potential applications are limitless.”.Castonguay shared that Team Car Care, operator and franchisee of the Jiffy Lube brand, is focused on automating high-volume manual tasks such as accounting reconciliations and store support. The company is deploying an agent to help reconcile inventory transactions, a data-intensive process. Processing that much data has been a challenge, he said. “But it’s promising, and we expect to see ROI soon,” he added..This work requires data-focused accountants who understand both the process and how the agent operates. And it requires all the team members to bring ideas to the table. “Whether it’s in Salesforce, whether it’s in Workday, whether it’s in a native third party tool—how can we leverage the use cases and the technology?” Castonguay said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-salesforce-paypal-team-car-120545514.html,No risk.

Users may also benefit from improved daily payment options and financing solutions such as working capital and business loans - use cases already thriving on the Stellar network - ultimately enabling a more seamless flow of value across global markets..""For years, stablecoins have been deemed crypto's 'killer app' by combining the power of the blockchain with the stability of fiat currency. As we see cross border payments being a key area where digital currencies can provide real world value, working with Stellar will help advance the use of this technology and provide benefits for all users,"" said May Zabaneh, Vice President of the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Digital Currency Group, PayPal..An expansion on Stellar would give PYUSD users access to its vast network of on and off ramps, providing additional access through digital wallets, and connected to local payment systems and cash networks.

This aligns with PayPal's narrative of evolving into a commerce platform focused on personalized experiences, with the introduction of smart wallets and expanding Venmo and PayPal debit card services. Such partnerships could contribute positively to transaction volumes and support earnings growth, although macroeconomic uncertainties and regulatory challenges remain..Over the past year, PayPal's shares saw a total return of 9.63%, despite underperforming the US market's 12.4% rise. Compared to the US Diversified Financial industry, which posted a substantial gain of 22.4%, PayPal's performance seemed modest.

However, external factors and competition may impact this trajectory..With a current share price of US$68.05 and an analyst consensus price target of US$82.32, this suggests a potential upside. Analysts estimate revenue growth to reach US$37.7 billion by 2028, alongside an expected earnings of US$5.5 billion, provided PayPal sustains its focus on higher transaction margins through optimized services.

Bitcoin (BTC), which reached a record high in May, gave up some of the gains but has since bounced back and is trading above the $110,000 mark..The pullback seen in late May was largely due to profit-taking by the big whales, which have been selling off Bitcoin as tariff tensions continued to worry them. However, positive economic data, such as easing inflation, has raised expectations that the Federal Reserve might begin cutting interest rates soon, which is likely to benefit the crypto market..In this environment, investing in crypto-related stocks could be a strategic move. Companies like PayPal Holdings PYPL, Visa Inc. V, and CME Group Inc. CME stand out for their strong growth potential heading into 2025. All three have seen upward revisions in earnings estimates over the past three months..Bitcoin hit a record high of $111,886.41 on May 22. However, the cryptocurrency gave up some of its gains in the final week of May. The decline can be attributed to profit-taking. However, Bitcoin has still managed to stay above the $100,000 mark for more than 30 days at a stretch..The rally regained momentum over the weekend, and on Monday, Bitcoin price surged more than 4% and was hovering around 110,500. The continued rally in Bitcoin is being driven by a mix of favorable developments, including improving U.S.-China trade relations, optimism over upcoming crypto regulations and increasing institutional investment..Investor sentiment has further improved after President Donald Trump announced a temporary pause on new tariffs, and the United States and China agreed to a 90-day halt on imposing fresh duties. Talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled, alongside negotiations with other global trading partners..Meanwhile, regulatory progress in the crypto space is boosting confidence. The GENIUS Act — a legislative proposal aimed at regulating stablecoins — has made progress in the Senate. Trump and his crypto/AI advisor, David Sacks, have continued voicing strong support for pro-crypto policies, signaling a more favorable future for the digital asset industry..PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +4.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.2% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Paypal belongs, has gained 5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share, indicating a change of +7.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $5.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.64 indicates a change of +11% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-trending-130011431.html,No risk.

2025-06-09 17:26:00,PayPal's Undervalued Pivot,"Despite muted TPV growth and rising competition, PayPal's AI?driven checkout overhaul, Venmo scale?up, and margin expansion make today's sub?14x valuation a rare buying chance","I've been watching PayPal slide from around $90 in early February to under $70 today, and I think the selloff is overdone. PayPal may look like yesterday's fintech story, but under the surface, a strategic pivot is underwayone that centers on product reinvention and margin-focused execution. While headline TPV growth remains subdued and competition from Apple Pay and Google Pay intensifies, PayPal is quietly reshaping its core checkout experience with AI-powered flows, scaling up Venmo monetization, and pushing deeper into higher-margin branded transactions. These aren't just tweaksthey're a calculated shift toward a leaner, platform-driven model that emphasizes profitability over volume. With transaction margins rising and EPS up 23% year-over-year, the company is proving that it can grow earnings despite top-line headwinds. At just 13.8x forward earningswell below its historical averageI believe the market is underappreciating the strength of this transition and the earnings leverage it unlocks..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with PYPL..PYPL Data by GuruFocus.I see the heart of PayPal's business in its transactionsabout 60 per account each month on average, a number they're aiming to grow in 2025. Their main moneymaker is that ~3% fee they take on each transaction, so naturally, more spending means more revenue. They also bring in some money from other stuff like interest on balances, subscriptions, and referral fees, but about 90% of their total revenue still comes from transaction fees. That's why management is so focused on boosting total transactions..In 2024, PayPal processed $1.68 trillion in TPVup a huge 165% since 2018which keeps it at the top of the online payments space. But here's the catch: while TPV keeps rising, the take rate (what PayPal earns from that volume) has steadily dropped. It's now down to 1.72%, which is a 5.3% decline year over year. That tensionbetween massive scale and lower cut per transactionis what makes PayPal's model tricky to evaluate. In the latest quarter, we saw this play out clearly. They beat expectations on EPS, which shows their cost discipline is working, but they missed on transaction margin and saw basically no user growth. Venmo monetization is still a bit of a slow burn too. And yeah, take rate pressure isn't going away overnight..But I don't think those negatives outweigh the positives. Branded checkout TPV grew 6% (adjusting for leap day), and the refreshed checkout experience is now live on over 45% of U.S. flowsup from just 30% last quarter. That's a big move. To me, that signals the pivot is working. If they can keep shifting volume toward high-margin branded flows and roll out more of these AI-powered checkout tools, I think they'll hit their transaction targetsand start expanding margins again too.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypals-undervalued-pivot-092657712.html,No risk.

The balance sheet is in solid shape, with $15.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $12.6 billion in debt. Profitability is worth mentioning, as the operating margin was a stellar 19.6% in Q1. For this full year, the company is expecting to produce $6 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow. The plan is to spend $6 billion just on share repurchases. .The market has soured on this company, as the stock currently trades 77% off its peak from July 2021 (as of June 3).

Bitcoin (BTC), which hit an all-time high last week, has also slipped over the past few days, but is still well above the $100,000 mark..The recent decline comes as profit-taking is underway, with big whales selling Bitcoin over the past week. However, slowing inflation and easing trade tensions have raised hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts in the coming months, which bodes well for cryptocurrencies..Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and CME Group Inc.’s CME. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days..Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 last week. Since then, the cryptocurrency has pulled back marginally and was hovering around $104,500 on Wednesday night.

The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being fueled by several encouraging developments, such as easing trade tensions, rising hopes for favorable U.S. crypto regulations, and growing interest from institutional investors..Moreover, investors have lately shrugged off trade tensions since President Donald Trump announced a temporary halt on tariffs. Also, the United States and China agreed to a 90-day pause on new tariffs as part of a trade truce. The White House said earlier this week that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will talk about trade issues this week. Trade negotiations with other nations are also underway..At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry is seeing encouraging developments on the regulatory side. The GENIUS Act — a proposed bill focused on regulating stablecoins — recently passed a key stage in the Senate. Trump, along with his crypto and AI advisor David Sacks, has also been actively backing pro-crypto policies, boosting investor confidence in the digital currency market..Visa is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.

Mizuho also cited confidence in CVS’s integrated healthcare strategy and improving margins..PayPal was highlighted for its potential to accelerate branded checkout volume growth..Mizuho expects total payment volume growth to reach 8-10% in the coming years, helped by “the rollout of the new checkout experience,” Buy Now, Pay Later integration, and increasing momentum for Pay with Venmo..“Management feels it is only beginning to scratch the surface of the flywheel,” analysts said..Oracle earned a spot as Mizuho sees the company as a “double-digit growth company.” The firm pointed to Oracle’s $104 billion FY29 revenue target and strength in cloud infrastructure. “Many investors continue to under-appreciate the attractiveness of Oracle’s OCI offering,” Mizuho wrote, noting it is about “33% cheaper than AWS for basic compute services.”.Related articles.Mizuho updates U.S. top picks: Adds CVS Health, PayPal and Oracle.CrowdStrike has ’limited valuation upside and increased growth risk’: BofA.Oppenheimer upgrades Dollar General on better outlook, earnings momentum",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mizuho-updates-u-top-picks-123141078.html,No risk.

These developments expand PayPal's customer payment options and global footprint, potentially bolstering revenue and strengthening merchant relationships. The focus on personalized consumer experiences and smart wallet services aligns with PayPal's aim to enhance revenue streams beyond traditional payment processing, which is crucial given the competitive and regulatory challenges identified in the broader analysis..Over the past year, PayPal recorded a total return of 12%, including share price movements and dividends. This performance aligns with the general trends in the market, matching the US market's 11.9% rise but trailing the US Diversified Financial industry's 22% gain during the same period. Comparatively, PayPal's stock price remains below the consensus price target of US$82.32, indicating a 17.3% potential upside from the current price of US$68.05..These new initiatives may influence future revenue and earnings forecasts, especially if PayPal continues to expand its transaction volume and improve margins through enhancements such as the Buy Now, Pay Later service and other value-added offerings. Analysts project revenue growth at 5.2% per year, lower than the broader market's expected growth. Earnings are forecasted to rise to US$5.5 billion by 2028, with a profit margin increase to 14.5%.

Palantir was founded with the idea that it could take fraud protection tools like those used by PayPal to help uncover hidden threats and protect the U.S. from terrorists following the Sept. 11 terrorist attack..Palantir's first product, Gotham, can gather and analyze data from a vast and wide array of data sets and has been used by the government for such things as identifying and tracking terrorist financing, as well as locating high-value targets in military zones. The U.S. government remains Palantir's largest customer today, accounting for 42% of its revenue last quarter..BigBear.ai, meanwhile, was formed when private equity firm AI Industrial Partners merged analytics company BigBear and systems integrator NuWave together, later adding two other analytic companies and taking it public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) back in 2021. The company is largely a government contractor, with a focus on defense, national security, and IT modernization. It has been awarded contracts with a number of government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD), National Security Agency (NSA), Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)..Outside the public sector, Palantir's biggest area of growth has come from U.S. commercial customers that have embraced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which works as an orchestration layer that allows users to apply AI models to help solve real-world problems. The platform can be used for a plethora of tasks across disparate industries, with everyone from hospital operators to pipeline companies now using AIP..BigBear.ai's tech also isn't just limited to defense, with it being used in the manufacturing, life sciences, and logistics industries.

PayPal's growth opportunities, improved profitability, and strong moat make its outlook attractive.  Naturally, investors want to cash in on this, and two notable companies to consider doing so are Block (NYSE: XYZ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL).","Block's expanding suite of services should allow it to make headway within its vast addressable market..PayPal's growth opportunities, improved profitability, and strong moat make its outlook attractive..10 stocks we like better than Block ›.The fintech industry is on a rapid northbound path, and thanks to the increased need for digital payment methods, that likely won't stop anytime soon. Naturally, investors want to cash in on this, and two notable companies to consider doing so are Block (NYSE: XYZ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). These fintech giants have been rocked by company-specific issues this year, and the volatility broader equities experienced probably didn't help things either. However, both stocks could still deliver attractive returns over the long run..Block is famous for running two key ecosystems: Square, which offers businesses slick point-of-sales systems and other services, and Cash App, a peer-to-peer payment app increasingly competing with banks. Though Block's two core businesses have generally performed well, the company's first-quarter results were disappointing due to Cash App's less-than-impressive growth. Overall, Block's financial results were not what investors had in mind, leading to a significant post-earnings sell-off; the stock is down by 30% year to date..The good news is that Block has several growth opportunities. It recently announced that it had received approval from the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to offer Cash App users consumer loans directly instead of relying on an approved partner bank. This development is great for Block, but a critical point to note here is that the company continues to add new products to its Cash App and Square ecosystems..Block's services have historically expanded, whether customer loans, crypto trading, buy-now-pay-later offers, etc. With about 57 million monthly active users within Cash App, cross-selling more of its added services could meaningfully move the needle for Block. That's partly why Cash App's gross profits increased by 10% year over year to $1.38 billion despite its monthly active users remaining flat compared to the year-ago period. The fintech specialist expects new loan products (which it is expanding to more consumers following the FDIC's approval) to help spur growth..And that's before we talk about the fintech leader's Square ecosystem, which is still making steady progress. Block estimates its gross profit opportunity to be in the neighborhood of $190 billion. In Q1, its total gross profit grew by 9% year over year to $2.29 billion. Competition is tough. Block won't get close to capturing this entire market by itself. But if the fintech specialist can grab even 5% of it in the next five years, its financial results will improve meaningfully.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Paypal (PYPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +7.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.08 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.66 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-paypal-holdings-130010736.html,Market Sentiment Risk

V, PYPL, and CLSK emerge as top stock picks with rising earnings outlooks.","The cryptocurrency market resumed its rally earlier this month, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high of $111,886.41 last week.

Bitcoin's upward trend comes as volatility continues in the broader market. The opposite movement suggests that several investors might be turning to cryptocurrencies as alternative assets or safe havens amid stock market volatility..Also, trade tensions have eased substantially in recent weeks. The United States and China recently agreed to a temporary trade truce, pausing new tariffs for 90 days. The United States also reached a trade deal with the U.K. earlier this month, and negotiations with other countries are ongoing, according to the White House..Meanwhile, the crypto sector has seen promising signs on the regulatory front. The GENIUS Act — a proposed law designed to oversee stablecoins — recently cleared an important hurdle in the Senate. On top of that, President Donald Trump, alongside his advisor on AI and crypto, David Sacks, has been actively promoting a pro-cryptocurrency policy stance, further lifting confidence in the digital asset market..Also, investors are awaiting the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, which begins on Tuesday at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas, as they look forward to some positive development on the cryptocurrency..Visa is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.

Both ecosystems of this financial services enterprise have huge total addressable markets, which supports durable growth.","This digital payments pioneer benefits from a network effect, and it continues to generate strong profits..Both ecosystems of this financial services enterprise have huge total addressable markets, which supports durable growth..Both fintech stocks trade at compelling forward P/E ratios..10 stocks we like better than PayPal ›.There are many trends shaping our economy. And while everyone seems to remain fixated on artificial intelligence (AI), it's important not to forgot about a trend that has been ongoing for several years..I'm talking about the intersection of financial services and technology, otherwise known as fintech. This category includes both younger and faster-growing enterprises, as well as those that are a bit more mature. Nonetheless, given the rising importance of these businesses, investors should consider allocating capital to the industry..Here are two of the smartest fintech stocks that investors can buy with $1,000 right now..The first fintech stock to add to your portfolio is none other than PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which has been leading the digital payments revolution for more than 25 years. The company is known for its flagship PayPal branded checkout solution and commerce app, but it also has a merchant-facing solution known as Braintree, as well as the popular peer-to-peer app called Venmo..While the company isn't growing like it was during the depths of the pandemic, PayPal still reported a 1% year-over-year revenue jump in Q1 2025 (ended March 31). This was driven by a 3% increase in total payment volume. Greater activity is supported by new product features launched under Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss. What's more, PayPal is focused on expanding its advertising capabilities, which makes sense, given all the data it collects on purchase behavior..The beauty of being a scaled platform is that PayPal benefits from a powerful network effect. As more merchants participate in the ecosystem, having a PayPal account becomes more valuable for consumers. The opposite is also true, with merchants finding more utility as the number of individual accounts grows..Another advantage of PayPal's scale is that it is an extremely profitable company. It posted $1.5 billion in operating income in the first quarter, translating to a stellar operating margin of 19.6%. This bottom-line performance lets management spend sizable amounts on share repurchases, to the tune of a planned $6 billion in 2025..As of this writing, PayPal shares trade at a forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of just 14.8. This seems like a deal that's too good to pass up.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartest-fintech-stocks-buy-1-093000191.html,No risk.
2025-05-17 00:23:00,PayPal vs. Block: Which Fintech Stock is a Stronger Buy Right Now?,PYPL and XYZ are well-known players in the rapidly evolving fintech sector. Which one is a better investment option right now?,"PayPal PYPL and Block XYZ are well-known providers of digital payments in the rapidly evolving fintech sector. Both offer peer-to-peer payments, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) solutions and a cryptocurrency buy-sell platform. An expanding portfolio and rich partner base make both PayPal and Block well-positioned to address the growing needs of the global fintech market. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are bringing rapid changes in the fintech market with growing demand for digital wallets, tokenization and account-to-account transactions. So, PYPL or XYZ, which of these Fintech stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out..Portfolio strength has been helping PayPal maintain deep and trusted relationships with merchants and consumers. Its two-sided platform helps develop direct financial relationships with customers and merchants. PYPL’s investments in improving branded checkout, person-to-person (P2P) and Venmo are helping in driving total active accounts. The company’s gradual evolution from a payments company to a commerce platform bodes well for investors.In first-quarter 2025, transaction margin dollars grew 7% year over year to $3.72 billion, driven by omnichannel commerce, both online branded checkout and offline branded payment methods, Venmo, and Payment Service Provider (PSP). Venmo revenues grew 20% and accounted for 18% of Total Payment Volume (TPV). PayPal expects transaction margin in dollar terms (ex-interest on customer balances) to grow between 4% and 5% in 2025.PayPal saw BNPL volume growth of more than 20% in the first quarter, and monthly active accounts grew 18% year-over-year. PYPL stated that BNPL users spend 33% more on average and conduct 17% more transactions. PayPal plans to increase consumer awareness of its BNPL solutions through campaigns in the United Kingdom and Germany, with continuing investments in Australia, France, Italy and Spain. The company’s omnichannel strategy has been a success in the United States, and PayPal plans to replicate that internationally. The company remains on track to launch NFC capabilities in Germany later this quarter and bring PayPal everywhere to the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2025.PayPal’s expanding partner base, including Fiserv, Adyen, Amazon, Global Payments and Shopify, is also driving prospects..Block’s comprehensive commerce ecosystem, which enables sellers to combine software, hardware and payment services to accept payments from customers, helps it sustain solid momentum across sellers. The company’s omnichannel offerings, which help sellers create differentiated customer experiences on the back of customer insights by managing orders from POS and eliminating manual aggregation of online and in-person orders, are adding strength to its seller base. Block is expanding its portfolio with the new Square POS app that integrates domain-specific commerce and payments functionality into a single, unified app that allows sellers to personalize their offerings. The latest Square Point of Sale app offers seven modes that are purpose-built for different industries.However, Block has been suffering from a shift in consumer spending. Cash App Card spending in the first quarter of 2025 suffered from lower discretionary spending in areas like travel and media. Challenging macroeconomic conditions don’t bode well for Block’s near-term prospects. Gross profit, which grew 9% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, is now expected to grow 9.5% in the second quarter and accelerate in the second half of 2025, with double-digit growth in third-quarter 2025 and mid-teens in fourth-quarter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-vs-block-fintech-stock-162300851.html,Market Risk 
2025-05-16 22:43:00,Bitcoin on Track to Hit New High: 3 Crypto-Centric Stocks in Focus,"Stocks like V, NVDA and PYPL are likely to benefit from the ongoing Bitcoin rally.","Cryptocurrencies are on a rally again, thanks to some encouraging economic data and easing trade tensions, which have given a boost to investors’ confidence. Earlier this week, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time in nearly five months..Bitcoin is now on track to surpass its all-time high of $106,533 attained on Dec. 22. Bitcoin had a stellar 2024 and experts had predicted that the cryptocurrency could cross $140,000 once global tensions ease..Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. V, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and PayPal Holdings PYPL. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days..Bitcoin surpassed $104,000 on Thursday night on renewed optimism that easing trade tensions and cooling inflation will save the U.S. economy from slipping into a recession. The Commerce Department said earlier this week that inflation is cooling steadily..The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% sequentially in April and 2.3% from the year-ago levels, the lowest since February 2021. The monthly reading was in line with expectations, while the 12-month inflation came in below economists’ expectations..Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also increased 0.2% month over month in April, lower than the forecast of 0.3%. Year over year, core CPI grew 2.8%, which came in line with analysts’ expectations. Inflation is now on track to meet to Fed’s 2% target..The broader market has rallied this week as investors breathed a sigh of relief after the United States and China announced a trade truce following talks over the weekend. Both countries decided to temporarily halt tariffs for 90 days and work out a deal..Investors are expecting more trade deals with other countries to be worked out soon. Easing trade tensions and signs of cooling inflation have alleviated fears of a weakening U.S. economy..Investors are also hopeful that the easing inflation will give the Federal Reserve the confidence to resume its rate cuts in the near term. This is likely to further help the crypto market as higher interest rates for a longer period can have a negative impact on cryptocurrencies by dampening investor interest in high-risk assets, increasing the cost of holding non-interest-bearing assets like Bitcoin, and strengthening the U.S. dollar, which are often considered a headwind for the crypto market.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-track-hit-high-3-144300017.html,Market Risk

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +17.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.08 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.8%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.66 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-paypal-holdings-130011909.html,No risk.

Despite a 3% decline in overall revenue, Block’s operating income rose an impressive 28% year-over-year, reaching $466 million. The company’s Square business showed strong momentum, particularly in key verticals such as retail and food & beverage, while its international operations achieved robust 15% year-over-year growth..In light of these factors, despite Cash App’s setbacks, Block’s diversified business model and attractive valuation underpin a bullish outlook for the stock moving forward..Cash App’s growth has plateaued, with monthly active users holding steady at 57 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. Additionally, the app’s gross profit fell short of expectations, largely influenced by shifts in consumer spending behavior. It’s important to note that Cash App’s user base skews toward lower-income adults, a demographic particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations..The competitive landscape for Cash App is increasingly challenging. Major players such as PayPal (PYPL), Zelle, Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOGL) exert significant pressure. Apple and Google present unique challenges given that their payment solutions are pre-installed on their respective smartphones, creating a seamless user experience. Zelle, owned by leading banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, benefits from deep integration with users’ banking relationships, further enhancing convenience. Meanwhile, Venmo has gained traction through its social networking features, appealing to younger demographics..This saturated market and fierce competition from established financial institutions and technology giants have constrained Cash App’s growth prospects..However, there are promising signs on the horizon. Block is actively pursuing initiatives aimed at reigniting growth for Cash App. Notably, the FDIC recently approved Block’s application to offer consumer loans through the platform. This development aligns with Square’s expanding focus on the buy-now-pay-later market, following its strategic acquisition of Afterpay in 2021, and could unlock new revenue streams and user engagement opportunities moving forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/block-xyz-square-resilence-shines-091545644.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Financial Risk

""There’s always hesitation: Can I trust this? [The stablecoin legislation] is going to answer a lot of those questions."".Both executives said they expect a wave of new issuers to enter the market once regulation is in place, followed by a period of consolidation. “It’s not going to be 300 stablecoins, and it’s not going to be just two,” Fernandez da Ponte said..Currently, Tether's USDT USDT and Circle's USDC USDC dominate the market, representing nearly 90% of the $230 billion asset class. PayPal’s PYUSD PYUSD, launched in 2023, lags far behind with $900 million supply. Fernandez da Ponte pushed back on market cap as the primary metric for success. ""We look at velocity, active wallets, number of transactions,” he said. “Those are what drive real usage."".In countries with high inflation and volatile currencies, consumers are seeking out dollar-backed stablecoins as stores of value and tools for cross-border payments. Soohoo said MoneyGram, which operates in over 200 countries with nearly half a million cash-access locations, is helping facilitate that access..""We see ourselves between physical finance and digital finance,"" Soohoo said. ""A lot of consumers in local economies want to hold value in dollars but still need to access it as cash to spend in places that don’t take digital currency."".Stablecoin adoption in developed countries, meanwhile, has been slower.

I’m particularly pleased with the payment pioneer’s strategy to expand profitably, enhance the user experience, and monetize key platforms such as Venmo. Notably, PYPL is implementing so-called “agentic commerce” to sustain its growth trajectory and appease shareholders clamoring for revenue growth. As a result, I’m staying bullish..Despite current concerns regarding the macroeconomy, management’s cautious but consistent guidance and potential upside shifts from government policy anticipated in 2026 provide a reassuring outlook. With a tempting valuation at about 14x non-GAAP earnings, PayPal appears undervalued..PayPal reported strong Q1 2025 results, highlighting robust earnings even as revenue growth was subdued. Revenue increased a mere 1% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, but non-GAAP earnings per share surged 23%. And this was no coincidence, as PayPal consciously rebalanced its business model to focus on profitable transactions rather than volume growth. The benefit was evident in their operating margin, which increased by more than 250 basis points..What was encouraging was PayPal’s smart choices in processing payments. While total payment transactions fell a bit, branded checkout transactions grew. Venmo also did well, with revenue growing 20%, driven largely by more users making purchases with debit cards and more merchants accepting Venmo as a form of payment. These metrics show that PayPal is growing strategically in areas that matter..Despite such strong results, PayPal was committed to conservative full-year guidance, projecting FY2025 adjusted EPS of $4.95 to $5.10. At first glance, that would seem cautious, but from my perspective, it’s astute. By establishing reasonable targets in an uncertain macro backdrop, PayPal is giving itself room to beat the numbers down the track. Should consumer spending and online payments pick up modestly, this guidance provides ample room for upside surprises.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-pypl-unleashes-agentic-commerce-113406180.html,Regulatory Risk Market Risk Technological Risk

The sector has plenty of highly successful stocks, but many of them range from expensive to really expensive when comparing valuations..Two notable exceptions are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). The former is close to the S&P 500 average when measuring its forward price-to-earnings ratio. The latter is quite a bit cheaper than the average..Here's why each of these tech stocks can make for a good long-term investment right now..The best tech companies are adaptive and forward-thinking -- attributes that Meta Platforms has in spades. Since starting out in social media, it has expanded into virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), the metaverse, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology..Not every swing has been a home run, at least so far. Meta Platforms' Reality Labs, which focuses on VR, AR, and the metaverse, has reported losses exceeding $60 billion over the past five years related to its development efforts. It's still too early to write this division off -- Ray-Ban Meta glasses surpassed 1 million in sales last year and now have AI features -- but the results to this point haven't been great..Speaking of AI, that's looking much more promising for Meta. It's using AI-powered content recommendations to increase user engagement on its social platforms, and AI-enabled ad tools are helping advertisers get a better return on their spending, which is encouraging additional spending. In Meta's first-quarter results, it reported a 5% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and a 10% increase in the average price per ad. In addition, total revenue for the quarter increased by 16% and adjusted earnings per share jumped by 37%, both beating expectations..The main cause for concern with Meta Platforms is an overreliance on advertising, as it makes up about 98% of the company's total revenue. In an economic downturn in which companies slash their marketing budgets, Meta Platforms could struggle. And a downturn might be on the way -- J.P. Morgan analysts recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 60%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-tech-stocks-buy-hold-084000626.html,No risk

After a steep decline from its pandemic-era highs, the stock has oscillated between $50 and $90 per share. Today, the stock is priced near its lowest valuation since going public, showing how investor sentiment toward the fintech has soured in recent years..Under CEO Alex Chriss, who stepped into the top role in 2023, PayPal is working on improving its profit margins and reigniting its growth trajectory. If PayPal's bargain price tempts you, here are a few key things to consider..PayPal has experienced a notable slowdown in growth. While it once enjoyed rapid revenue and earnings increases, especially during the pandemic when digital payments boomed, the pace has since tapered off..PayPal faces stiff competition from several big players in the digital payment space. Alternatives like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Shopify Payments, Zelle, and Block's Cash App are all vying for consumers' attention, alongside traditional credit and debit payment methods..One key area of concern is PayPal's decline in its take rate, which is the percentage of transaction value that the company retains as revenue. As competition in the payment space heats up, PayPal's take rate has slowly declined year after year..Last year was expected to be a transformational one for PayPal, with investors hoping the company would regain its footing and chart a promising course for the future. Unfortunately, the outlook hasn't been as bright as expected..The stock price took a hit in February after PayPal released its full-year results for 2024. Among investors' concerns was slow growth in unbranded transactions, prompting fears that the company's aggressive push for profitability and improved margins might stunt its transaction growth instead..Given the unknown impact of tariffs on consumer spending and the broader economy, PayPal also offered more conservative earnings guidance for the year, even after strong first-quarter results..PayPal's stock has become significantly more affordable over time. However, as noted above, some of this price drop is due to a slowdown in growth and pressure on the company's take rate. That said, the stock is trading at an attractive price point. In fact, it's one of the cheapest valuations on several measures since it spun off from eBay in 2015.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-deep-value-stock-value-101500648.html,Market Risk Financial Risk

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Paypal (PYPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +15.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Paypal falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.7%..The consensus earnings estimate of $5.05 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.64 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-paypal-holdings-inc-130011843.html,No risk.

PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) are recognized as fintech leaders that have found success in carving out distinct niches within the evolving landscape..Despite their volatile stock prices during the past year, both companies' strong product innovation and ongoing expansion efforts position them to reward shareholders over the long run..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Let's discuss which of these fintech growth stocks is the better buy for your portfolio right now..With a history spanning more than two decades, PayPal pioneered online payment processing as an early disruptor to legacy banking systems. Today, the company facilitates transactions for 436 million active customers in more than 200 countries. PayPal has evolved by focusing on differentiated and value-added solutions to drive profitability rather than emphasizing user growth and low-margin activities. The strategy appears to be working..In the recently reported first quarter, even as the number of total payment transactions declined by 7% year over year, the company's key performance metric of total payment volume (TPV) climbed by 3% year over year, generating a 7% increase in transaction margin..Branded checkout, representing payment experiences where PayPal's brand or the Venmo platform are central to the transaction, has been a key part of the TPV growth. PayPal is also seeing traction in its market with its merchant-oriented payment service provider (PSP) offerings. Even more impressive was the 23% increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) compared to the prior-year quarter..Management expects the trends to continue, targeting full-year transaction margin growth between 4% and 5%, alongside a 6% to 10% increase in adjusted EPS over 2024. Where PayPal shines as a growth stock, and part of its allure as an investment opportunity next to SoFi Technologies, is its attractive valuation. Shares of PayPal trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 13 based on analysts' average estimated 2025 EPS.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed during the episode of Mad Money on May 1st, 2024..During the Mad Money episode which aired on Tuesday, Jim Cramer discussed how stock ownership is viewed in the United States, saying:.“Alright, look, lately, we can’t go a day without hearing some widespread misperceptions about stock ownership. I gotta tell you, I think it’s infuriating. Here we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of Mad Money, dedicated to the proposition that you can potentially make lots of money by picking individual stocks, yet I keep hearing that most Americans don’t care about the stock market, and this direction means nothing.”.READ ALSO:  How Did Jim Cramer’s 12 Bold Predictions Play Out? and Did Jim Cramer Nail All These 9 Stock Predictions?.Jim Cramer challenged the idea that the stock market only serves the wealthy, calling it a flawed and dismissive perspective that overlooks the financial involvement of millions of ordinary Americans, saying:.“It’s the whole reason anyone watches the darn show, and it generally matters, not just to the rich, but to tens of millions of regular people, home gamers, and never let any politician tell you otherwise. […] More than 60% of Americans have some exposure to the market, either directly or indirectly. 70 million people have active 401Ks. Millions more have retired with them. 60 million people have IRAs. Only 156 million people voted in November. I mean, we’re talking half the electorate here.”.Cramer argued that stockholders make up a major segment of the population and should not be ignored. He stated, “It’s not just arrogant, rich people who own stocks.” He also criticized affluent individuals who caution others against investing in stocks while continuing to benefit from their tax advantages. As he put it:.“Now look, stocks are ridiculously tax advantaged, more than just rich people want that. In a world where probably no more than 10% of this country can retire on their paycheck savings, stocks represent a different kind of social security, a one-sided pack where people try to save and the government dismisses them.”.For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on May 1st, 2024.

Coinbase is one of the leading U.S. crypto exchanges, and PayPal is a major player in e-commerce and online payments..Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to real-world assets such as the U.S. dollar. As such, they offer a blockchain-based payment method that doesn't suffer from crypto's usual volatility. There's fierce competition for market share among the various stablecoins, and PayPal's Coinbase deal could give it a serious leg up..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Let's look at why the deal matters and how increased stablecoin usage is good for the wider crypto ecosystem..On April 24, Coinbase and PayPal said they had deepened their partnership to increase the adoption of the PYUSD stablecoin. PayPal wants to integrate PYUSD into more of its products to make payments cheaper and faster for merchants..The deal means:.You can now buy PayPal USD fee-free on Coinbase..You can convert PayPal USD directly into U.S. dollars..For crypto investors, one important part of the deal is that the two companies plan to collaborate on ways to use PYUSD in decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi allows people to manage money without relying on intermediaries like banks. An example would be earning interest through peer-to-peer lending..Increased adoption of DeFi is somewhat of a work in progress. It's hampered by various issues, from limited utility to security and regulatory concerns. It could be a real-world use case for cryptocurrency, but it has a long way to go before people trust it with their cash..PayPal introduced its dollar-pegged stablecoin in 2023, but it has yet to take significant market share from current leaders, Circle's USDC and Tether. This deal increases PayPal's potential to disrupt the status quo and become a serious player in the stablecoin race..Stablecoins are a significant force in the crypto world. According to CEX.IO, stablecoin transfer volume reached $27.6 trillion in 2024 -- more than the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard.

At the time, the SEC sent a subpoena requesting “the production of documents” tied to PYUSD, the firm said, without specifying what documents the agency requested..The decision to drop the PYUSD probe offers another indication of the current SEC’s stance on stablecoins..In an April 4 statement, SEC Division of Corporation Finance staff issued guidance stating that it did not view fully backed dollar-pegged stablecoins marketed for payments and not for interest or yield as security offerings..At the same time, the move is a significantly positive development for PayPal as the firm shows a renewed desire to make inroads into the cryptocurrency space through PYUSD..Trending: New to crypto?

For example the PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) share price dropped 54% over five years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. Furthermore, it's down 24% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report..Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery.

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)..While the share price declined over five years, PayPal Holdings actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 24% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS..Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock..In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 10% a year in the five year period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity..You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image)..It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies.

However, the company recently turned in solid Q1 results and issued upbeat guidance while laying out its growth strategy for this year..With its stock still beaten down, let's dig into its more recent report to see if a turnaround is near..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Above all else, PayPal CEO Alex Chriss is looking to transform PayPal from a payments company to a commerce platform that just doesn't facilitate transactions but helps merchants attract and retain customers. This includes helping customers discover new products based on a personalized shopping experience, suggesting the best payment options, and post-transaction engagement..It has a number of product initiatives on this front, including a smart wallet that can automatically apply available discounts, cash back, or loyalty programs. Its Fastlane solution, meanwhile, allows customers to check out with just a single tap without having to set up individual accounts at different merchants. It also has a commerce API that gives merchants access to PayPal's consumer profiles so that merchants can personalize product recommendations and offers. All these solutions are aimed at improving conversion rates for merchants to help them improve their sales..One of Chriss' main priorities since taking over has been to emphasize profitability rather than low-margin revenue growth. This could be seen in the company's Q1 results. Revenue rose just 1% to $7.79 billion, but adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 23% to $1.33. Analysts were looking for adjusted EPS of $1.16 on revenue of $7.85 billion, as compiled by LSEG..Transaction margin dollars, which are similar to gross profits, climbed 7% to $3.72 billion. This has been one of the most closely watched metrics for the company as it moves away from just trying to grow revenue to trying to grow profitably..Total payment volume (TPV), which is the payment volume that runs through its system, rose 4% to $417.2 billion. PayPal branded checkout TPV continues to show solid, steady growth, rising 4% on a constant currency basis, or 6% when adjusted for Leap Day..Payment transactions fell by 7% to 6 billion, while payment transactions per active account slid 1% to 59.4 on a trailing-12-month basis. Part of the reason behind this decline is that the company has raised prices on its unbranded BrainTree segment in order to ""price to value,"" which has lowered the segment's number of transactions. BrainTree tends to serve high-volume, large platforms, so any customer loss hits total transaction volumes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-paypal-stock-look-poised-082300025.html,Market Risk

Nonetheless, shares are down a troubling 24% in 2025 (as of April 29)..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Should invest buy this cheap stock right now and hold it for the long term?.During the three-month period that ended March 31, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) posted $7.8 billion in revenue, up just 1% year over year. This gain, while small, was supported by 1.5 million net new accounts, bringing the total to 436 million. And it's worth highlighting PayPal's monster total payment volume (TPV) of $417 billion, which was 3% higher than Q1 2024..PayPal has multiple segments. However, Venmo is the current star of the show. The peer-to-peer app registered 20% revenue growth, with TPV increasing 10% to $76 billion..While the top-line growth wasn't anything to get excited about, the business is making great strides further down the income statement as profitability is improving dramatically. ""PayPal had a great start to the year, and our strategy is working,"" CEO Alex Chriss said. ""This is our fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with progress across branded checkout, PSP, omnichannel, and Venmo."" .Diluted EPS surged 56% from the first quarter of 2024. PayPal's operating expenses declined 4% year over year, demonstrating cost discipline. Guidance calls for EPS growth of 20% to 24% for the full year..PayPal has been pioneering digital payments and online commerce solutions for over two decades. This makes it a leader in the industry and has led to durable competitive advantages. PayPal's brand is held in high regard, known for trust, security, convenience, and innovation in the eyes of both merchants and consumers looking to move money around.

The subpoena requested the production of documents. In February 2025, the SEC communicated it was closing this inquiry without enforcement action,"" PayPal disclosed this week in a filing..Wednesday's filing marks the latest SEC move to drop investigations and lawsuits against crypto companies. The regulator has informed more than a dozen firms that it would drop investigations and cases..Read more: PayPal Faces SEC Subpoena Over Its PYUSD Stablecoin.Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar — have become a focal point in the debate over how crypto should be regulated. Regulators have questioned whether these instruments resemble securities or money market funds, which could draw in issuers such as Circle and Tether to greater scrutiny. PayPal's involvement attracted added attention due to its size, brand recognition and reach across traditional and digital finance..For PayPal, the resolution of the SEC's probe removes a key regulatory overhang as it continues to push deeper into blockchain-based payments. The company launched PYUSD on Ethereum in August 2023 as a dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills and dollar deposits, designed for use in peer-to-peer payments, commerce and decentralized applications..The news also comes at a time when stablecoins are becoming the hottest trend among crypto and TradFi firms. Companies such as Ripple, Mastercard, Visa, Dutch bank ING and Stripe are all joining the stablecoin industry. Ripple even reportedly offered $4 billion or $5 billion to buy stablecoin issuer Circle. Meanwhile, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) said that stablecoins are in a ""WhatsApp Moment"" for money transfers, with the potential to disrupt the payments industry like instant messaging did for cross-border phone calls and texts..Amid intensifying competition, PayPal recently said it’s set to begin offering U.S. users a 3.7% yield on balances of its PYUSD to up the ante in the stablecoin wars. The payment giant's stablecoin has a market cap of $887 million, putting it in sixth place among stablecoin issuers, according to CoinMarketCap data..Read more: Stablecoin Market Could Grow to $2T by End-2028: Standard Chartered.Disclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

To revitalize the long-term strategy, the company hired all-new leadership, including CEO Alex Chriss. The team has been hard at work on growth initiatives, including building an advertising platform that leverages PayPal's massive collection of data, launching a best-in-class debit card product, and several cryptocurrency improvements..To be sure, not all of the efforts are reflected in the numbers. For example, the ad platform will take some time to ramp up. However, the company's first quarter results clearly show signs of progress..For starters, a year ago, PayPal reported a year-over-year decline in active users. In the first quarter, the company announced an increase of 9 million active users over the past year. Total payment volume grew by 4% despite a challenging consumer spending environment, and thanks to a focus on efficiency, PayPal's adjusted EPS grew by an impressive 23%..Some of management's initiatives are certainly showing results. For example, Venmo monetization is a big priority of management, and the payment app's revenue growth accelerated to 20% in the quarter. Debit card payment volume grew by more than 60%, as the recent product launch appears to have been a success..In its recent investor day, PayPal said that it aims to achieve sustainable 20%-plus annualized earnings growth in the long run. With the business already generating more than $6 billion in free cash flow annually, and a valuation of just 13 times forward earnings, PayPal could be a steal for patient investors at these levels.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-no-brainer-fintech-stocks-092200931.html,Macroeconomic Risk Market Risk Regulatory Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other billionaire Cliff Asness’ stock picks with huge upside potential..Cliff Asness, the founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, is a well-known figure in the world of finance. Starting with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness was able to boost the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund’s assets to more than $100 million in just a handful of months. Cliff Asness’ investment strategies, which focus on value and momentum, have delivered exceptional returns for AQR, setting him apart from his fellow hedge fund managers. As a testament, the fund has produced positive returns over the last three years, with its greatest year in 2022, when it returned 43.5%..The first quarter of 2025 continued that momentum. As Wall Street grappled with increased volatility resulting from President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policy, AQR Capital Management outperformed the market by 9%. The firm’s Apex strategy, a $3 billion multi-strategy fund that includes equities, macro, and arbitrage trades, rose 3.4% in March, adding to its strong quarterly performance. Meanwhile, AQR’s Delphi Long-Short Equity Strategy returned 9.7%, while its trend-following Helix strategy gained 3% during the same period..Cliff Asness has repeatedly stated that he is not an admirer of Bitcoin. In a recent CNBC interview, the hedge fund manager voiced pessimism about Bitcoin, claiming that it had no realistic use case, although he did not rule out the possibility that the leading cryptocurrency has formed a bubble. Back in February, the billionaire stated that Bitcoin and the S&P 500, were basically “the same thing” with varying amounts of volatility. Asness has also questioned the notion that Bitcoin must be seen as a store of value simply because it has a limited supply..The billionaire seemed even more critical of the idea of a cryptocurrency reserve, a stance that sharply contrasts with President Donald Trump’s. In a piece written for The Free Press, the money manager stated his thoughts about the President’s executive order:.“I’ve been managing money for 33 years now with some modest success. While there are some worthy competitors, it’s hard for me to remember a much worse idea than the U.S. launching a “strategic cryptocurrency reserve.” Nevertheless, on Thursday, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for just such a fund. David Sacks—Trump’s crypto czar—tweeted that the reserve would be “like a digital Fort Knox,” perhaps forgetting that the U.S. has been off the gold standard since 1933. In any case, his words do not diminish my scorn for this dangerous boondoggle, as I will explain below.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-among-151943669.html,No risk.

But it's hard to blame the market for the lack of excitement as the business is struggling to grow these days, as Pfizer expects its top line this year to be nearly unchanged from the previous year, and at worst, it could decline. .For long-term investors, this presents a great chance to load up on the healthcare stock. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 8 (based on analyst expectations), and the company has been gearing up for more growth ahead. CEO Albert Bourla has acknowledged that the company will face adversity because of generics, which could result in it losing as much as $18 billion in revenue from its top line by the end of the decade. But at the same time, through in-house development and acquisitions, it plans to add $25 billion. .It has acquired multiple businesses in recent years, including oncology company Seagen, in an effort to bolster its long-term prospects. Management expects Seagen could contribute up to $10 billion in revenue by the end of the decade (up from over $3 billion last year). Pfizer is also optimistic about its mRNA pipeline, projecting that business to bring in between $10 billion and $15 billion by 2030. .Last year, it also obtained approval for a gene therapy treatment, Beqvez, to treat adults with moderate to severe hemophilia B (a rare bleeding disorder). The gene therapy market is in its early stages but it has the potential to be a huge opportunity for pharma giants like Pfizer.

The two countries are its largest European markets and they are the biggest outside the U.S..In the U.K., PayPal also introduced payment app improvements for consumers last year that include biometric functionality to enable two-factor authentication, Chriss said. PayPal says the two countries are its largest European markets..“We’ve really suffered in the last few years with what I would consider to be one of our poorest app experiences for consumers,” Chriss said of the U.K. market, adding that the former app “really was choppy and created a lot of friction and a lot of latency in the experience.”.Nodding to the impact of U.S. tariffs, PayPal declined to update its full-year forecast Tuesday despite a robust jump in first-quarter profits. Company executives expressed confidence about consumer spending in the current quarter, but warned that it’s unclear how consumers may behave later in 2025, given the uncertainties around President Donald Trump’s trade war..PayPal, which is based in San Jose, California, has been battling tepid growth with its flagship payments service, prompting a revamped strategy last year under Chriss, a former Intuit executive who joined the company in September 2023..PayPal executives also noted a surge in payment volume for April, which they attributed to many consumers shifting forward their purchases ahead of potential price hikes due to U.S. tariffs. That trend is likely to taper off in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said..“With a strong first quarter behind us and a good start to the second, we believe we are on pace to outperform our original expectations for the first half of 2025,” Miller said. “At the same time, given uncertainty in the environment and the potential for a wide range of outcomes, we are appropriately cautious.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-targets-european-branded-growth-100000326.html,No risk.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks that should double in 3 years..On April 25, Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management executive chairman and co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the latest market trends and express how this is a reasonable place for long-term investors to enter the market. Despite persistent concerns about a recession coming from tariffs, Firestone thinks that corporate earnings have generally exceeded expectations. The strong performance of major tech companies has been a key driver behind the market’s recent gains, such as those in the MAG7. Elaborating on the significance of these tech giants, Firestone also underscored that the top 2 companies in the S&P 500, regardless of which they are, match the market value of the bottom 300 companies in the index. This concentration means that these leading firms are fundamental to the US economy’s progress..The conversation then addressed the impact of proposed FDA budget cuts on innovation for biotech companies. Firestone agreed that such cuts could slow down the approval process for new products and drug manufacturing, and she advised against reducing the FDA’s budget. However, she believes that the market has already priced in these risks. She compared the situation to previous market overreactions, such as the 32% drop during the early COVID-19 period, which was followed by a rapid recovery..Firestone also concluded that the market is now fairly valued. Some sectors offer attractive opportunities due to recent price declines. She assessed the overall market valuation in light of tariff uncertainties and the recent rebound from a 20% drop to a current decline of about 10.5%. She explained that the market’s price-to-earnings multiple has decreased from 22.5x next year’s earnings to 18.5x, assuming no severe recession. She’s confident that the market is unlikely to end the year lower than current levels and recommends that long-term investors enter the market at this stage. Firestone believes that the market has partially priced in the impact of tariffs. She estimated that a 5% to 10% tariff is reflected in current prices. While a full-blown recession may not be entirely priced in, a slowdown likely is..We sifted through financial media reports and Reddit threads to compile a list of the top 30 stocks that should double in 3 years.

For example, comparable store sales declined 4% year over year, but this is a significant improvement from the 7% decline reported in the prior quarter..While I wouldn't exactly call Starbucks a cheap stock (it trades at about 27 times earnings), it's also worth noting that margins are temporarily squeezed due to accelerated investment in Niccol's initiatives. In the latest quarter, operating margin declined by nearly four percentage points to 11.9%. But if the turnaround continues and margins rebound (which they should), this iconic company could be a home run for patient investors..PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) growth essentially stalled after the COVID-19 pandemic ended, and the company decided to replace its entire leadership team, starting with new CEO Alex Chriss, a former Intuit executive.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against the other fintech stocks..The terms finance and technology are combined to form the term fintech. This wide category includes companies that integrate modern technology into financial operations. Fintech companies include, for instance, those that create and run person-to-person payment applications and those that develop innovative digital payment processing solutions..Many fintech stocks have recovered from the post-COVID-19 down market, but they are still well below their peak as we approach 2025. Nonetheless, the fintech industry has numerous opportunities for long-term potential..In 2025, fintech is beginning to rebound. Global fintech funding rose to $8.5 billion in Q4 of 2024, a 12% increase from the previous quarter, according to CB Insights. While overall 2024 funding decreased 20% year on year, this is a significant improvement from the 48% and 44% declines in 2023 and 2022, respectively, showing that capital flows to the industry have stabilized..The regulatory sentiment is also altering. For example, in a statement released on January 21, Travis Hill, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, provided a list of priorities, including plans to.“adopt a more open-minded approach to innovation and technology adoption, which includes a more transparent approach to fintech partnerships and to digital assets and tokenization, and engagement to address growing technology costs for community banks.”.This suggests a more relaxed regulatory framework, which could stimulate a resurgence of fintech activity..The fact that some of the biggest fintech companies, such as Swedish buy now, pay later unicorn Klarna and neobank Chime, are now indicating plans to go public is another significant clue that the industry is recovering from the blues. Furthermore, since financial monitoring is a crucial component of public markets, this probably signals profitability improvement, which has been a significant difficulty for the fintech industry..Tyler Griffin, managing partner and cofounder of Restive Partners, stated to American Banker:.""I’d bet that the chief financial officer of every late-stage, privately funded company is at least exploring what an IPO in the near term looks like.”.The financial technology industry has never been static; rather, it thrives on challenging the status quo. Financial services have changed in recent years due to a combination of technological developments, regulatory changes, and economic disruptions. In 2024, fintech saw a massive spike in the usage of AI, mostly for internal use cases like operational efficiency and fraud detection. However, issues with accuracy and privacy continue to restrict consumer-facing applications. According to a Deloitte survey, the biggest obstacle to generative AI adoption in financial services, according to 35% of enterprises, is real-world errors. Financial organizations are hesitant to use AI tools directly with customers because of regulatory sensitivities. Nonetheless, enterprise adoption is speeding up. Within a year, Morgan Stanley introduced its ""Debrief"" assistant, which OpenAI powers. Meanwhile, BNY Mellon and OpenAI have partnered for several years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-among-022751816.html,No risk

2025-04-28 15:06:00,2 Industry-Leading Companies Warren Buffett Should Strongly Consider Acquiring With Berkshire Hathaway's $334 Billion War Chest,"If the price is right, two dominant businesses -- one of which is already a sizable holding for Berkshire Hathaway -- would make for perfect acquisitions by the Oracle of Omaha.","Few Wall Street money managers have the ability to command the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the aptly dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha,"" Warren Buffett. Since Buffett took over as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 6,441,524%, as of the closing bell on April 24. Suffice to say he's lapped the broad-based S&P 500 many times over..Buffett's undeniable success has earned him a huge following. Investors regularly look toward Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs and Form 4s to determine which stocks he's been buying and selling. Mirroring Buffett's investing activity has been a path to success for decades..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».But over the past two and a half years, there's been far more selling than buying from Buffett and his top advisors. Berkshire Hathaway's brightest investment minds have been net sellers of stocks for nine consecutive quarters (Oct. 1, 2022–Dec. 31, 2024) to the tune of almost $173 billion. Selling plenty of stock has raised a lot of capital and swelled Berkshire's treasure chest (which includes cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries), to a record $334.2 billion, as of Dec. 31. This is enough cash to buy all but 21 of the 499 other companies that are in the S&P 500..Buffett is an unwavering optimist who believes in the long-term growth of the U.S. economy and America's stock market. But he's also an unabashed value investor who won't reach for great companies when their valuation doesn't make sense. With the stock market entering 2025 at its third-priciest valuation during a continuous bull market, when back-tested 154 years, Buffett has had every reason to sit on his hands and wait for price dislocations to present themselves..Following historic bouts of volatility for Wall Street's major indexes in recent weeks, some intriguing values have begun to emerge. With over $334 billion in cash at his disposal, the following two stocks would make for compelling acquisition targets, if the price is right..The first stock Buffett could acquire with relative ease is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI). Sirius XM's market cap is only $7.2 billion -- which makes one wonder if a buyout would do enough to move the needle for Berkshire Hathaway -- but Buffett's company already holds a whopping 35.4% of its outstanding shares.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-industry-leading-companies-warren-070600256.html,No risk.

Nonetheless, these growth forecasts face challenges like potential renegotiation pressures and global economic uncertainties, which could hinder revenue progression and affect earnings margins..In terms of valuation, PayPal’s current stock price of US$61.42 is at a 27.9% discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$85.24. If the company achieves an earnings increase to US$5.3 billion by 2028, trading at a projected PE ratio of 16.3x, the price target could be realized.

Coinbase also plans to use its platform to offer PYUSD to PayPal’s extensive network of merchant partners, which could ease the use of stablecoins in everyday transactions..Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies, predominantly the dollar — are one of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto. They are marketed as a faster and cheaper alternative to legacy payment systems, and are increasingly popular for payments across borders. Standard Chartered projected the sector to grow to $2 trillion by 2028 from the current $220 billion..With regulation for stablecoins advancing in the U.S., the competition is heating up among issuers while banks and traditional payment firms are also eyeing the market.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed..In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed whether President Trump could fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. The President is an ardent supporter of low interest rates, and in his recent comments, he asserted that Powell has to reduce rates. However, this particular program wasn’t the first time Cramer discussed the possibility..In fact, he first raised the possibility in a program aired in late March. We covered Cramer’s remarks as part of our coverage of Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Wonders If Trump Will Try Firing The Fed Chairman. Back then, the CNBC TV host linked the President’s potential action against the Fed chair with the recent dismissals of officials from the Federal Trade Commission..Cramer commented:.“Look, uh, there is a. . .theme here. You fired two Democrats. In the FTC. No one knows what to do. If he can fire two, if he can fire two from the FTC, he can fire Powell. Now doesn’t matter whether it’s legal or not. I thought Peggy Newton had a great piece today, talking about President Jackson. Now we’re really going back, even before McKinley, which is somehow the North Star for this administration. And I think people are just worried that Powell will be fired cause he’s not cutting rates. And I think that all of that we just heard is irrelevant. What matters that as long as there’s a belief that despite Fed chief Powell saying twice that he’s not going anywhere, as long as there is a belief that President Trump may actually have this . . where he can fire anyone, no one’s safe.”.He added that potential action against Powell might have been priced into the markets as Cramer believed stated: “I’m not saying that he will do this. I am saying that since the FTC. . .look if he took it off the table you would see the futures positive right now.”.Cramer maintained the theme in his latest remarks. When his co-host asked him if it was legally possible for the President to take action against Powell, he commented: “I mean they fired, look, I mean he fired these two FTC people. You’re not supposed to be able to do that.”.Commenting further on the legal aspects, Cramer outlined:.“And there you could say that look Chevron allows me to do it. That Chevron decision. I mean what happens when he comes out and he goes to Truth Social and he says that I’ve decided to run a third term. I mean there’s enough people in the government who would say, yeah, okay.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-paypal-holdings-131835038.html,Market Risk

PayPal says the integration with Coinbase will allow merchants on its network to settle directly in PYUSD instead of traditional financial rails..Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents like PayPal say that they could be used to send payments instantly..""This combination of being able to connect the consumer bases of PayPal and Coinbase, bringing our merchants to the table, bringing [Coinbase's] institutional access to the table -- we think that it creates a really, really powerful combination,"" said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal's senior vice president of blockchain, crypto and digital currencies..The two companies also plan on partnering for future efforts to increase the adoption of stablecoins for payments and explore use cases for PYUSD on decentralized finance platforms, which allow users to transact directly on a blockchain network without intermediaries..""This is a partnership that is all about advancing the future of global payments, taking stable coins mainstream, pushing forward this technology,"" said Lauren Abendschein, global head of institutional sales at Coinbase..Coinbase has previously only offered the same zero-fee treatment for Circle's stablecoin, USDC, the number two stablecoin in terms of market capitalization..""Definitely there will be cases for payments where people will make a choice between PYUSD and USDC, and we want to make sure that we establish PYUSD as the best stablecoin for payments,"" said Fernandez da Ponte..Circle has also doubled down on the use of its stablecoin for payments.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Payments Dive newsletter. .Digital wallets from payments players like Block and PayPal generally offer better fraud monitoring and liability protection versus similar products from the big technology companies Apple and Google, according to the research organization Consumer Reports..That reflects differing U.S. regulations for wallet providers, according to a review by the consumer research firm of six major consumer wallets..Consumer Reports evaluated a half dozen digital wallets over a 10-month period ending in March for a report released Thursday. The wallets were from Apple, Cash App, Google, PayPal Holdings, Samsung and Venmo. PayPal also owns Venmo..All six allow consumers to make contactless payments and, except for Google, peer-to-peer money transfers. Consumer Reports divided the wallets between traditional tech companies (Apple, Google and Samsung) and the three fintechs that have been more payments focused from their start (Cash App, PayPal and Venmo). The evaluation focused on the wallets’ payments and P2P functions..Four of the wallets – from Apple, Cash App, Google and PayPal – were rated broadly equal overall for their wallet and pay functions, slightly ahead of those from Samsung and Venmo. Apple scored highest for the safety of its stored balance and P2P functions..Delicia Hand, senior director covering digital marketplace issues for Consumer Reports, said Wednesday in an interview, that the evaluation reveals a “gap between the sophisticated technology used to create a daily seamless payments experience and the lack of innovation in the consumer-protection features.”.Cash App, PayPal and Venmo are regulated under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act’s Regulation E, requiring them to investigate unauthorized transactions and errors, according to the report. .The large tech players, meanwhile, do not share that burden, and the fraud-monitoring commitments reflect it, as card issuers bear the obligation to monitor for fraud, Consumer Reports said. .“We understand that Apple is not a bank or a financial services company,” Hand said. “At the same time, no consumer is distinguishing between Venmo, Cash App, etc., from their use of an Apple wallet. They’re not saying, ‘OK, now when I use Google or Samsung Pay, I’m going to switch gears to a whole different set of expectations.”.The fintechs’ disclosure on their legal obligations “was relatively clear and transparent,” the report found.

2025-04-24 09:01:00,PayPal To Offer 3.7% Annual Yield on PYUSD Stablecoin To Drive Adoption and Expand Usage,"PayPal will begin offering a 3.7% annual yield on its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), for U.S. users starting this summer.","PayPal will begin offering a 3.7% annual yield on its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), for U.S. users starting this summer. The reward, paid in PYUSD, will accrue daily and be distributed monthly. Users can keep their PYUSD in PayPal or Venmo wallets, where it can be used for purchases, transfers, or conversion to fiat currency..The company launched PYUSD in August 2023 through Paxos Trust Company. The token is backed one-to-one by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar assets held in regulated accounts. It was initially deployed on Ethereum and later on Solana. Despite early momentum, PYUSD's market cap has fallen from a peak of $1 billion in 2024 to about $873 million. This remains small compared to Tether’s USDT, which has a market cap of over $145 billion..PayPal executives say the yield program is intended to promote everyday use of PYUSD, rather than having it sit idle in wallets or be limited to crypto-specific transactions. Blockchain lead Jose Fernandez da Ponte described the plan as part of a long-term strategy. “We are halfway in a 10-year journey,” he said. CEO Alex Chriss said the company is working to improve the cost and speed of payments by integrating stablecoins into its network. “We are thinking a lot about how we can change the expense profile of the payments landscape by using stablecoins,” Chriss said..The rewards won’t be solely funded by interest generated from the reserves backing PYUSD, allowing PayPal more flexibility than other stablecoins tied to Treasury yields. Fernandez da Ponte also noted that the return offered through the program is not dependent on Federal Reserve rates..The offer may raise regulatory questions. Tzahi Kanza, CEO of crypto investment firm Syndika, explained that while non-yield stablecoins are typically not considered securities, adding yield may change that classification. “Stablecoins that don’t offer yield are generally not considered securities. However, yield-bearing stablecoins may fall under that classification,” Kanza said. He added that the biggest risk is losing the token’s peg to the dollar..PayPal continues to expand its crypto-related services. In April, the company added support for Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL). PYUSD has also been used for cross-border settlements through Xoom, and the company is working to integrate it further into its global payment systems..Other financial technology companies like Robinhood, Revolut, Stripe, and Fidelity are exploring or developing their own stablecoin products.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other best Nancy Pelosi stocks to invest in now..We are aware that Nancy Pelosi isn’t the only member of the Congress with amazing stock picking ability. And wouldn’t you know it, fresh-faced financial geniuses like Marjorie Taylor Green are popping up, conveniently dumping Treasuries to load up on tech stocks just before a tariff pause. Green sold around $75000 (give or take $25000) of US Treasury bills to fund purchases of more than a dozen stocks (mostly tech stocks) before Trump’s temporary tariff pause announcement. We published the list of her stock picks in 20 Best Stocks to Buy According to Marjorie Taylor Greene..In the past few decades, stock trading based on access to information not made readily public was considered a side-benefit to being a lawmaker in the United States. After huge public outcry against the trading activities of lawmakers, Congress passed the STOCK Act of 2012 that made it mandatory for lawmakers to disclose these trades publicly. Staffers at The New York Times had previously claimed that trading patterns showed that the longstanding concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest or the use of inside information by members of Congress were viable and should have been addressed on a priority basis. Some US lawmakers, including Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, have advocated for a blanket ban on members of Congress and their family members from dealing in individual stocks while in office. Pelosi, who had previously voiced her opposition to such proposals, nevertheless continues to dabble at the stock market..During the 2020 pandemic, the stock trading activities of Pelosi went widely viral on social media as retail traders created the Pelosi Tracker, an account on social networking platform X that disclosed trades made by Paul Pelosi, the husband of the House Speaker who is an investor and owns and operates Financial Leasing Services, a real estate and venture capital firm. A spokesperson for the former House Speaker has said that Pelosi is not involved in the investment decisions made by her husband. This admission seems rather difficult to digest given the insider information that Pelosi is privy to due to her senior position in the House. Retail traders have since started mimicking the trading activity of the Pelosi Tracker to cash in on the popularity of the tracker. The reviews of such mimicking activity on platforms like Reddit seem mixed at best, but their popularity is uncontested.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-pypl-best-nancy-213541352.html,No risk.

A challenging macroeconomic environment with growing risk of a recession attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to levy tariffs on trade partners, including China, Canada and Mexico, is expected to remain an overhang on the stock.PayPal shares have underperformed Visa, Mastercard and Apple year to date. While shares of Visa and Mastercard have returned 7% and 2.5%, respectively, Apple shares have dropped 17.8%.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .Although PayPal’s cheap valuation is noteworthy, is it worth buying at current prices? Let’s dig deep to find out..Portfolio strength has been helping PayPal maintain deep and trusted relationships with merchants and consumers. Its two-sided platform helps develop direct financial relationships with customers and merchants. PYPL’s investments in improving branded checkout, person-to-person (P2P) and Venmo helped in driving total active accounts. Strong adoption of Fastlane is expected to boost future volumes as PYPL ink deals with NBCUniversal, Roku and StockX. PayPal expects transaction margin in dollar terms (ex-interest on customer balances) to grow at least 5% in 2025 and high-single-digit growth for 2027. Over the long term, this is expected to grow at more than 10%.Fastlane, which enhances the guest checkout experience by allowing users to complete their purchase in one click, is a noteworthy addition to the portfolio. PayPal’s partnership with Adyen, Global Payments, and Pfizer is expected to attract more merchants to Fastlane. The solution is not only improving conversion for PayPal’s merchants but also making more shoppers familiar with PayPal. Roughly 75% of Fastlane consumers are new or dormant PayPal users, while 25% of Fastlane users never had a PayPal account.PayPal is expanding value-added services to boost the merchant experience. In the fourth quarter of 2024, PYPL launched FX-as-a-service, which is an automated currency conversion, and the platform is already live on Meta Platforms. PYPL’s network tokens for automated billing capabilities are live with merchants, including Instacart, Mint Mobile, and Poshmark.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks under $100 to buy according to hedge funds..On April 21, Chris Davis of Davis Advisors appeared on ‘The Exchange’ on CNBC to talk about selectivity in today’s market. Davis pointed out that putting companies in groups like the MAG7 covers their underlying businesses, which can have different fundamentals and therefore prospects. For this reason, he acknowledged that he owns certain stocks from MAG7 but not all. Davis also clarified that his overall focus is on value and growth, which leads him to a diverse set of holdings and not just tech, such as financials and healthcare names. He then argued that the market is shifting back toward selectivity and active management. He suggested that active management is positioned for a resurgence because the indexes have become highly concentrated and richly valued..Davis acknowledged that while he cannot predict the market’s short-term movements, the present environment is ideal for stock pickers who can identify resilient businesses that are trading at reasonable valuations. He sees this as an opportunity for active management to outperform, as investors move away from momentum-driven index investing toward a more selective approach. He noted the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs as evidence that investors are beginning to act on this shift away from index concentration. He also believes that within the MAG7, only a few companies are truly well-positioned. Similarly, within the S&P 500, only 5% to 10% of companies possess the resiliency and durability needed for such volatile times..Davis laid out what he sees as the major transitions shaping the current investment environment. First, he described the shift from nearly 15 years of free money to a more normal interest rate environment. Second, he pointed to the end of a multi-decade era of globalization, which was replaced by deglobalization, rising nationalism, and geopolitical tensions. Third, he highlighted the impact of AI. He said that these transitions are occurring against a backdrop of market complacency, with high valuations and concentrated growth expectations..We first used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks that were trading under $100 as of April 22.

Both systems operate through banks. The U.S. has lagged other countries, such as India and Brazil, in cultivating use of such faster payment systems..FedNow was designed as a means of attracting smaller U.S. financial institution use of such instant payment systems after RTP was mainly used by their larger rivals. While FedNow’s arrival helped bolster use overall of both systems, they have struggled to lure broad adoption and real-time payment use in the U.S. remains relatively low..The use of open directory services would help accelerate corporate and consumer use of real-time payments in the U.S., the report from the council argued..“An open directory service could be available for use by any participating payment solution using common standards and methods to facilitate ease-of-use and adoption of faster payments by associating an alias to a specific account,” the report explained..The council’s report described how payment companies’ services, such as PayPal Holdings’ Venmo and Early Warning Services’ Zelle, currently use private “alias” directories, which tie email addresses and phone numbers to financial accounts, to facilitate payments. But it explained how those peer-to-peer systems don’t support broader interconnections for payments, such as paying bills.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-group-pushes-directory-instant-103900717.html,Operational Risk Regulatory Risk Market Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other cheap NASDAQ stocks..On April 10, Dan Ives, Head of Global Tech Research at Wedbush Securities, appeared on an interview at CNBC and expressed that the tech sector could be heading into a period of major volatility. Dan Ives addressed the current landscape for technology companies and pointed out that while a temporary pause in tariffs has provided some structure, the sector remains uncertain in general. He noted that even with this framework, large tech purchases are still being downsized or paused, which contributes to ongoing volatility, especially as companies approach earnings season. Many tech firms are either withholding guidance or providing only general outlooks. Ives described the situation as a storm whose full damage is only beginning to be assessed, with the industry still only a quarter of the way through the fallout. He explained the sharp pullback in major tech stocks by likening it to emerging from a storm and confronting the resulting damage..Ives highlighted that the uncertainty in tech has been amplified by the escalating tariffs on China, which are now as high as 125%, and are a major concern for a lot of companies, as China remains central to the global tech supply chain. Ives also pointed out that the recent tariffs on China have forced companies to reconsider the costs and logistics of importing critical components. For example, a $100,000 part might now cost double due to tariffs, causing companies to halt or delay large investments. This has resulted in a notable pause in tech spending, which he expects to continue at least through the current quarter. He cautioned that the June quarter is likely to be very weak. He maintained that, despite the challenges, he has not downgraded tech stocks, drawing on lessons from the pandemic playbook, where periods of uncertainty eventually led to clear winners and losers. Ives also addressed concerns that tech companies, by pulling back on spending, might risk drawing negative attention from the administration, especially given recent meetings between tech CEOs and the president. He reiterated that China is the epicenter of the current turmoil and that big tech is caught in the middle of a high-stakes situation, with companies still trying to navigate the evolving landscape..Ives predicted that Street estimates are likely to see earnings cuts of about 10% across internet and big tech companies, which reflects the broader pullback in spending and ongoing volatility.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-pypl-cheap-nasdaq-140158007.html,Market Risk 
2025-04-22 22:01:00,Analysts Estimate Paypal (PYPL) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Paypal (PYPL) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,"Paypal (PYPL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price..The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 29, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise..This technology platform and digital payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.9%..Revenues are expected to be $7.83 billion, up 1.7% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.83% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-paypal-pypl-report-140107779.html,Financial Risk
