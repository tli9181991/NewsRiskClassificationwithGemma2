2025-06-19 04:03:00,Nvidia stock notches fresh record high in remarkable 2025 turnaround,Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high on Wednesday.,"Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 4% Wednesday to notch a new record high of $154.31, completing a remarkable turnaround from earlier this year..Nvidia shares previously hit a record close of $149.43 on Jan. 6. The stock's gain also saw shares reach a fresh intraday high during Wednesday's trading session..The AI chipmaker’s stock has seen a significant upswing following its first quarter earnings in late May, which featured revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations and showed the company continuing to thrive despite a new export ban on sales of its chips to one of its largest markets: China..Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action..Shares have jumped more than 14% since Nvidia’s May 28 earnings report, far ahead of the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) roughly 3.4% gain in that time frame..Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah on Wednesday raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250, the highest of Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. The new price target suggests Nvidia's market cap could soar to $6 trillion from its current $3.6 trillion level..""While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,"" Baruah wrote in a note to clients, adding that Loop Capital analysts see the market for AI chips growing to $2 trillion in 2028..To be sure, questions remain over whether AI infrastructure demand will continue to rise, as Big Tech companies rake in far less revenue than they're spending to build the tech..Nvidia stock had struggled in the months following its record close in January as President Trump embarked on his trade war and artificial intelligence competition in China rattled the broader markets..Nvidia shares plunged in late January when a new cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek prompted demand concerns for its AI chips. Then, the stock plummeted again in April as Trump's steep tariff announcements rocked the stock market. Trump enacted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China, costing the chipmaker $2.5 billion in lost revenue in the first quarter and a projected $8 billion loss in the second quarter..Read more: How does Nvidia make money?.At the same time, Nvidia's competition in the Chinese market was heating up from domestic tech giant Huawei. Huawei is reportedly readying a new advanced AI chip that would be competitive with Nvidia's prior-generation H100 chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-notches-fresh-record-high-in-remarkable-2025-turnaround-200401502.html," The news about Nvidia's stock hitting a new record high can be analyzed for different types of risks:  1. **Market Risk**: The rise might indicate investor confidence, which could be viewed differently based on market context, but it's not inherently negative.  2. **Operational Risk**: The increase suggests positive strategies and growth, reducing the risk factor associated with operations.  3. **Regulatory Risk**: No mention of regulatory changes affecting Nvidia, so no applicable risk here.  4. **Liquidity Risk**: Stock highs don't directly impact liquidity unless market depth is concerned, which isn't indicated.  5. **Credit Risk**: No information about financial obligations or defaults, so this doesn't apply.  6. **No Risk**: The stock increase is seen as a positive event, indicating strong fundamentals rather than risk.  **Conclusion**: There's no specific risk associated with this news; the stock rise is viewed positively without indicating any inherent risks."
2025-06-19 04:03:00,Meta’s quest to dominate the AI world,Meta is on a quest to dominate the AI world. One way or another.,"Facebook parent Meta (META) is spending billions to grab the lead in the AI race, building out the data centers needed to develop and power high-end large language models. And now, the company is pouring billions more into snatching up top talent and technologies to grab the lead in the AI wars..Meta is reportedly in talks to bag Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross and former Github CEO Nat Friedman for its planned superintelligence lab. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was initially eyeing all of Safe Superintelligence but was shot down by co-founder Ilya Sutskever, according to CNBC..The move comes after Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI startup Scale AI and hired its CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang..And during an appearance on his brother Jack Altman’s “Uncapped” podcast, OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) CEO Sam Altman claimed that Zuckerberg has offered OpenAI employees upward of $100 million to join his company’s AI efforts. That’s not all: Meta also wanted to buy Perplexity AI (PEAI.PVT) but couldn’t come to terms on a deal..“Meta is doing this because they want to win the AI race, period,” Forrester analyst Mike Proulx told Yahoo Finance. “AI is everything right now.”.All of this follows Meta’s decision to postpone the debut of its massive Llama 4 Behemoth AI model. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company won’t launch the model until later this fall over concerns that it isn’t a big enough upgrade over prior models..“I think this is two things: No. 1 [is] confirmation that Llama is struggling,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “And second, is [it’s] also a sign that Zuckerberg is not OK with that.”.For Meta, the goal is clear: bring in as much fresh talent as possible to push its AI program forward and take the lead in the AI wars..Meta’s effort to rule the AI world differs from chief rivals OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. Rather than closing off its AI models, the company offers them as open-source software that developers and companies can use on their own..Meta imposes some restrictions on how users can take advantage of its models. For instance, the company requires firms to request a license from Meta if their product has more than 700 million monthly active users..Regardless, Meta’s ultimate goal is to get as many people as it’s comfortable with using and developing products via its AI models. Why not charge everyone who wants to access its software? Because Meta benefits every time a company alters its models, giving it greater insights into how it can improve them down the line.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-quest-to-dominate-the-ai-world-184836143.html," The quest by Meta to dominate the AI world presents several significant risks:  1. **Regulatory Risk**: Potential legal challenges due to strict data privacy laws and algorithmic bias regulations.  2. **Competitive Risk**: Struggles against established competitors like Google and Amazon, which could reduce market share without innovation.  3. **Ethical Considerations**: Ethical issues such as job displacement, biased algorithms, and data security risks may cause backlash.  4. **Market Competition**: High competition from other players necessitating constant innovation to maintain dominance.  These risks collectively pose challenges for Meta's aim to dominate the AI industry."

In summary, while NVIDIA's stock surge is positive, it may mask underlying risks such as market overreactions and potential future issues that could impact the stock price in the long term. Investors should consider these factors when making informed decisions."

Spending on AI computing gear has sent investors hunting for beneficiaries beyond marquee stocks like Nvidia Corp..Micron’s growth is being fueled by high-bandwidth memory — bundles of dynamic random access memory chips closely connected to processors from Nvidia — which is vital to AI computing. That’s helped drive up prices as supply remains constrained due to the complexity of producing and deploying such components..“Micron isn’t the star of AI, the way Nvidia is, but high-bandwidth memory chips are the gold standard for powering AI, and the demand for them is insatiable,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. Micron shares were about 0.5% lower at 1:30 p.m. in New York..The Boise, Idaho-based company is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 on revenue of about $8.9 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be an increase of 158% and 30% from the same period a year ago, respectively..“Pricing and availability of Micron’s high-bandwidth memory will be a central focus,” said Jake Behan, head of capital markets at Direxion. “Investors will be looking for clarity on production, supply constraints, and how well-positioned Micron is to meet hyperscaler and AI customer demand.”.Profitability will also be top of mind for investors after gross margins fell short of Wall Street expectations in the second quarter. Analysts at NewStreet Research are anticipating a recovery in DRAM and NAND gross margins, which would help Micron beat expectations..Adjusted gross margins are projected to be 36.8% in the third quarter, down from 37.9% in the previous quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates..Of course, anything short of a stellar report could trigger a selloff considering the magnitude of the stock’s gains. Micron is up about 95% since April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump sparked a relief rally by pausing tariffs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-faces-earnings-test-share-094239357.html," The analysis of Micron Technology Inc.'s situation reveals that the company is facing an operational or financial risk due to the upcoming earnings test. This risk arises because investors have already shown positive sentiment based on strong share performance, but there are concerns about whether Micron can sustain these earnings. If Micron fails to meet expectations, it could lead to a decline in investor confidence and stock price, resulting in underperformance risk.  **Risk Type: Operational/Financial Risk - Earnings Concerns**  Micron Technology Inc. is currently under pressure from investors who have been positively influenced by the company's recent performance. The upcoming earnings test is a critical evaluation of their ability to maintain profitability. This situation highlights potential risks such as underperformance, which could lead to investor sell-offs and a subsequent drop in stock value."

The seemingly illogical tumble in energy prices highlighted a new global reality: the world is awash in oil.  Gasoline prices barely moved this week, but experts say motorists will likely see prices at the pump begin to fall, perhaps as early as this weekend.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar on Monday, threatening to stoke a wider conflict in the Middle East, a region that supplies the world with about a third of the oil used globally every year. That same day, benchmark U.S. crude tumbled more than 7%, one of the biggest single day sell-offs this year. The following day, the same thing happened, driving crude prices down by double digits this week..The seemingly illogical tumble in energy prices highlighted a new global reality: the world is awash in oil..Gasoline prices barely moved this week, but experts say motorists will likely see prices at the pump begin to fall, perhaps as early as this weekend..With the situation in the Middle East still volatile, Iran could try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world’s oil passes daily. While few expect Iran to do that because it would cripple the ability to move its own oil, the fact remains that there have been drastic changes in the 50 years since an Arab oil embargo hobbled the U.S. economy and sent energy prices skyrocketing..Following is a quick rundown of the new forces on supply and demand that have reshaped the global energy landscape, and what you can expect to see as far as prices at the pump this weekend..PRICES AT THE PUMP.Technical innovation in the last two decades has upended global energy markets and made the U.S. the world's top oil producer, surpassing even Saudi Arabia in 2018. It's contributed to an extended surplus of oil, and that has consistenly driven prices lower..Gas prices have been in broad decline for roughly three years. That has remained true even during traditional periods of high demand, like the summer travel season just now kicking into high gear..Part of the reason, according to Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, is that the U.S. announced aggressive tariffs against its trading partners at around the time of year that U.S. gas prices usually begin to rise. That suppressed demand, for both households and businesses, due to anticipation of economic fallout from a broader trade war..And prices are likely to begin falling again, and fast. Gas stations bought their fuel supplies before crude prices slumped this week, so motorists have not seen gas prices decline due to a typical lag between oil and gasoline prices..“I think that the national average will probably cease to increase in the next 24 to 48 hours,” Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy said Tuesday. “Then it should stabilize for maybe a day or two and then we should start to see prices — at least the national average — to start falling this weekend.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/middle-east-conflict-highlights-vastly-174015319.html," The identified risk associated with the news is **oversupply-driven price volatility**. The Middle East conflict has disrupted global energy markets, contributing to a significant drop in crude oil prices due to increased supply from affected regions and possibly other producers stepping up production. This oversupply creates pressure on prices, leading to potential economic impacts such as rising transportation costs or shifts in fuel affordability. Additionally, geopolitical risks like continued instability or sanctions could further complicate the situation."

Bloomberg reported on June 18 that the conglomerate is planning a new round of layoffs, this time targeting its sales division. The move is reported to be ready for implementation starting early next month..Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com.This round of job cuts follows two others earlier in the year. The company cut around 6,000 roles in May, primarily impacting engineering and product positions. Earlier in January, there were also smaller cuts, which the firm said were performance-based. The latest round coincides with the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year on June 30. According to Bloomberg, this timing aligns with Microsoft’s historical pattern of announcing organizational changes around its fiscal year-end..Bloomberg also says that Microsoft has not specified the scale of layoffs, but the numbers are likely to be in the thousands. What is clear, the Bloomberg report details, is that the primary driver for this job cut is Microsoft’s strategic shift towards increased investment in AI..Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology company.

Such incidents could disrupt ongoing projects or lead to legal challenges, affecting their operational efficiency and compliance.  2. **Regulatory Risk**: The lawsuit involves intellectual property theft, which is a violation of both civil and potentially federal laws. Failing to address this could lead to penalties and affect the company's regulatory standing.  3. **Reputational Risk**: A court ruling in favor of authors could tarnish Microsoft's image as an ethical innovator, potentially deterring future collaborations on AI projects that involve others' intellectual property.  4. **Financial Risk**: Legal proceedings could incur significant costs, impacting financial performance and investor confidence. This might also lead to increased capital costs or lost revenue streams if projects are halted due to legal disputes.  Overall, this risk underscores the importance of managing intellectual property rights in AI development to avoid legal pitfalls, reputational damage, and financial strain on the company."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Salesforce vs. Veeva: Which Cloud CRM Stock Is the Smarter Buy?,VEEV's niche focus and strong margins give it an edge over CRM despite its higher valuation and smaller scale.,"Salesforce, Inc. CRM and Veeva Systems Inc. VEEV are two well-known names in the cloud customer relationship management (CRM) market. Both companies offer tools that help businesses manage customer relationships, but they serve very different markets. Salesforce is a global provider across industries, while Veeva focuses only on the life sciences sector, including pharmaceutical and biotech companies..As investors search for sustainable winners in enterprise tech, a deeper look into each company’s fundamentals, growth outlook and valuation helps determine which of these CRM stocks offers stronger long-term potential..Salesforce continues to dominate the CRM market, outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Over the years, Salesforce has built a strong and interconnected platform. The acquisition of Informatica, Zoomin and Own Company shows its intent to move beyond its position as a CRM software maker and become a broader enterprise software provider focused on artificial intelligence (AI), data and collaboration..AI is now central to Salesforce’s growth plan. Since rolling out Einstein GPT in 2023, the company has embedded generative AI into its platform to help businesses automate processes, improve decisions and offer better customer experiences. As AI adoption rises across industries, Salesforce is well-placed to benefit from the same..Its latest innovation, Agentforce, reflects that momentum. Paired with its Data Cloud, Agentforce has already hit $100 million in annualized revenues just two quarters after launch. More than 4,000 customers are using it for various tasks in sales, service and marketing. Data Cloud is also expanding fast, with annual recurring revenues growing more than 120% year over year. Salesforce’s broader strategy of bringing apps, data and AI agents under one umbrella gives it a strong edge..However, Salesforce’s biggest challenge right now is slowing sales growth. For years, the company has delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%..Salesforce Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Salesforce Inc. Quote.This slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-vs-veeva-cloud-crm-140900312.html," The analysis of the risk associated with Veeva Systems' stock based on the given article suggests that the primary risk lies within the broader market sector. Specifically, the cloud CRM market carries inherent risks such as competition from established players like Salesforce, potential shifts in technology affecting niche markets, and the possibility of a valuation-driven market sentiment bubble. While Veeva's strong margins and niche focus are advantageous, these do not mitigate the systemic risks present in its sector.  **Risk Type: Market Sector Risk (Cloud CRM)**  This risk encompasses the broader market factors affecting the cloud CRM industry, including competitive dynamics, technological changes, and investor sentiment related to valuation multiples."

Unnecessary cuts could erode investor trust, while necessary ones might signal long-term strategic shifts.  5. **Employee Impact**:    - Potential effects on employees include increased unemployment claims and negative sentiment, though if seen as part of planned changes, it may be viewed more favorably.  In conclusion, Microsoft's layoffs at Xbox may not inherently pose a major risk but could lead to short-term market volatility depending on the context and perception. The actual impact hinges on the reasons for the layoffs and investor reaction."

He said: “CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!

During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL. On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR.” This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will!

While the direct geopolitical impact on energy markets might be limited, several factors contribute to this classification:  1. **Unreliable Information Source**: Trump's statements were made through Truth Social, a platform known for promoting conspiracy theories. This could spread misinformation, creating market uncertainty.  2. **Economic Policy Impact**: Trump's remarks after Powell's congressional appearance suggest potential changes in monetary policy, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on inflation and interest rates, impacting investment strategies.  3. **Sector Volatility**: The energy sector might see increased volatility due to geopolitical tensions, while real estate could face challenges from travel and tourism impacts.  In summary, while the immediate geopolitical risk is moderate, the broader implications of unreliable information and potential economic policy shifts introduce a moderate overall risk."

Eric Woodruff, Semperis' Chief Identity Architect, presented his findings this week at the Troopers 2025 in Heidelberg, Germany..nOAuth was first disclosed in 2023 by Omer Cohen of Descope, highlighting a flaw in how some SaaS applications implement OpenID Connect. Semperis' follow-up research focused on Entra-integrated applications in Microsoft's Entra Application Gallery, identifying a wide range of applications still vulnerable to nOAuth abuse more than a year later..Discovered through cross-tenant testing, nOAuth exploits Entra ID app configurations that permit unverified email claims as user identifiers, a known anti-pattern per OpenID Connect standards. In these scenarios, attackers need only an Entra tenant and the target's email address to assume control of the victim's SaaS account. Traditional safeguards like MFA, conditional access, and Zero Trust policies offer no protection..""It's easy for well-meaning developers to follow insecure patterns without realizing it and in many cases, they don't even know what to look for,"" said Woodruff. ""Meanwhile, customers are left with no way to detect or stop the attack, making this an especially dangerous and persistent threat."".Safeguarding Against the nOAuth Vulnerability.In a broad test of more than 100 Entra-integrated SaaS applications, Woodruff found nearly 10% were vulnerable to nOAuth abuse. Once the vulnerability is exploited, attackers can gain full access to a user's account in the SaaS app, enabling data exfiltration, persistence, and potential lateral movement. The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) advises SaaS vendors to follow its recommendations to prevent nOAuth abuse or risk expulsion from the Entra Application Gallery..""nOAuth abuse is a serious threat that many organizations may be exposed to,"" continued Woodruff. ""It's low effort, leaves almost no trace and bypasses end–user protections. We've confirmed exploitation is still possible in many SaaS apps, which makes this an urgent call to action. We encourage developers to implement the necessary fixes and help protect their customers before this flaw is exploited further.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/semperis-research-uncovers-ongoing-risk-133000230.html," The primary risk associated with this news is a **cybersecurity risk**, specifically due to a known OAuth vulnerability in Microsoft's Entra ID.

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Singapore VC Granite Asia leads $60 million funding round for AI ‘data foundry’ Centific to fuel global expansion,"“This funding round isn’t about necessity—it’s about ambition,” CEO Venkat Rangapuram said in a statement.","The “AI data foundry” Centific closed a $60 million Series A funding round led by the Singapore-based venture fund Granite Asia, as the U.S.-based startup explores an ambitious expansion to Asia..AI startups are now paying close attention to Asia as they search for new markets for their AI models. Local AI developers, such as China’s DeepSeek, are showing that Asian AI models are sitting on the technological frontier..“This funding round isn’t about necessity; it’s about ambition,” CEO Venkat Rangapuram said in a statement. “This investment turbocharges our mission: to empower enterprises with AI systems that are resilient, agile, and meticulously fine-tuned.”.Centific plans to use the funds to expand the functionality of its platform, improve its research and development, and deepen its collaboration with partners like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Lenovo..The AI startup works with larger businesses to develop, train, and deploy their AI, including trying to eliminate bias, hallucinations, and other mistakes. “Unless the model is grounded in very specific scenarios and datasets, it can’t really solve enterprise-related issues,” Rangapuram said in a conversation with Fortune. “There’s a whole lot of things that need to be thought about before you can go live in an enterprise setup.”.Centific started as the U.S. division of Pactera, a Chinese IT consulting and outsourcing firm. After Chinese Electronics Corp., a Chinese state-owned company, acquired Pactera in 2020, it carved out the U.S. business, which eventually became an independent company..Rangapuram told Fortune that he was intrigued by the “disruptive and exciting possibilities” of physical AI, particularly in ASEAN and Singapore. (“Physical AI” refers to models designed to work with real-world machinery, like manufacturing equipment.) “The future is not just in North America, it’s global,” he said..The wish to expand to new markets was why Centific turned to Granite Asia and famed venture capitalist (and MPW Asia listee) Jenny Lee, one of the fund’s senior managing partners. Rangapuram pointed to Granite’s “network and resources within Asia and India” as part of the reason why he turned to Lee and her fund “as we diversify from the North American market into alternate markets around the globe.”.Granite Asia, in turn, sees the Centific investment as part of its mission to build “enduring infrastructure for the future of industry,” Lee said in a statement accompanying the funding announcement. Centific “is uniquely positioned to become a foundational partner in the enterprise AI stack.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-vc-granite-asia-leads-130000605.html," The news about Centific raising $60 million from Granite Asia involves several potential risks:  1. **Operational Risk**: The allocation of funds could lead to inefficiencies or misprioritization of strategic initiatives if not managed effectively.  2. **Market Risk**: Concerns exist regarding the technology's scalability and staying ahead of emerging AI advancements, which might affect future growth.  3. **Regulatory Risk**: Expansion in multiple regions without proper compliance could lead to operational issues or legal challenges.  4. **Competitive Risk**: Lacking a unique value proposition could hinder market share growth in a competitive AI landscape.  5. **Strategic Risk**: Rapid expansion without clear alignment with long-term goals might misalign resource deployment and strategic objectives.  6. **Dependency on Venture Capital**: Reliance on a single investor (Granite Asia) may expose Centific to potential vulnerabilities related to investment decisions or market fluctuations.  7. **Risk of Underperformance**: Execution challenges, competition from established players, and external economic factors could lead to failure in achieving expansion goals.  While the article doesn't explicitly mention these risks, their nature as an expansion funding round implies these underlying concerns. Without detailed information on fund allocation and strategy execution, these risks remain potential threats."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,2 Hot Stocks Riding the AI Wave,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is benefiting from booming demand for AI chips.  While companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which develop top-tier AI models, generate a lot of headlines, there are plenty of publicly traded companies successfully riding the AI wave as well.  Two prime examples are Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), both of which look like great AI bets.","Oracle's cloud-computing business is accelerating as it taps into AI computing demand..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is benefiting from booming demand for AI chips..Both stocks look like AI winners..10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a game-changing technology with the potential to disrupt industries and deliver massive productivity gains. While companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which develop top-tier AI models, generate a lot of headlines, there are plenty of publicly traded companies successfully riding the AI wave as well. Two prime examples are Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), both of which look like great AI bets..As Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure became the top two players in the public cloud-computing market, Oracle was largely left out. However, soaring demand for AI computing capacity has changed the story. Oracle has been rapidly building out AI-enabled data centers, and the results have been impressive..Oracle's cloud-infrastructure revenue surged by 52% year over year in the final quarter of fiscal 2025 to $3 billion. That's still small relative to the market leaders, but Oracle is growing much faster. Amazingly, growth is set to accelerate. Oracle expects cloud-infrastructure revenue to grow by more than 70% in fiscal 2026 as more data centers come online and its infrastructure investments pay off..The cloud-infrastructure business is now large enough that Oracle's overall revenue growth is likely to accelerate in fiscal 2026 thanks to that blockbuster growth. Revenue was up 8% in fiscal 2025 to $57.4 billion, and it should accelerate to double digits in fiscal 2026..Beyond cloud infrastructure, Oracle's cloud-software business is also growing swiftly. Overall, cloud-application revenue rose by 12% in the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion, with both Fusion Cloud ERP and NetSuite Cloud ERP reaching the $1 billion market. This is offsetting lower on-premise software license revenue and weaker growth in hardware and services..Oracle has undoubtedly found its niche in the cloud-infrastructure market, and it's aggressively building out more capacity to meet demand. As long as the AI boom continues, Oracle is set to be an unlikely AI winner..Essentially, all the AI accelerators powering the AI revolution, from Nvidia, AMD, and others, are manufactured by TSMC. As tech giants increasingly design their own AI chips, TSMC is the manufacturer of choice. For the first five months of 2025, TSMC's revenue has risen by more than 42% year over year as demand for AI chips soars.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-hot-stocks-riding-ai-103500254.html," The analysis reveals that Oracle (ORCL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) are exposed to several significant risks associated with the growth of the AI sector:  1. **Market Volatility**: Potential for increased price fluctuations due to heightened market activity related to AI, though Oracle's established position may mitigate this.  2. **Economic Sensitivity**: Vulnerability to broader economic downturns affecting the tech sector, which could impact their performance during recessions or slower growth periods.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: Possible changes in regulations affecting data privacy and intellectual property, impacting companies based on their compliance practices.  4. **Geopolitical Risks**: Susceptibility to global trade policies, government regulations, and international competition affecting their export-oriented business.  5. **Overvaluation Risk**: Potential for stock prices to rise abnormally due to high valuations, risking significant declines if the trend doesn't sustain.  6. **Supply Chain Risks**: Dependence on semiconductors could lead to production delays or cost increases, affecting operational efficiency and profitability.  7. **Competition Intensification**: Increased competition from established tech companies might drive down valuations as the market becomes saturated.  These risks collectively pose challenges that could influence Oracle and TSM's stock performances in response to the AI-driven demand trends."

But it's also a good strategy for tech investors to look elsewhere for new opportunities. After all, companies like Palantir Technologies were barely a blip on the radar just a few years ago. But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems. And each has a market cap of less than $100 billion -- which means there's plenty of room for further growth and profit for your portfolio..DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) got its start in 2013, but it's one of those companies that really took off during the pandemic, as people were much more interested in eating at home than venturing out. That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives..The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns..DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms..If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE).

Removals from these projects will be among the first issued under ACR’s IFM v2.1 protocol, a next-generation methodology that advances the field via dynamic baselines, enhanced additionality and monitoring requirements, improved quantification accuracy, and increased transparency..At the heart of this initiative is Anew’s Epoch Evaluation Platform, a proprietary system that leverages machine learning, high-resolution satellite imagery, drone data, and ground-based field measurements to enable ongoing, location-specific tracking and validation of forest carbon baselines, surpassing the requirements of the IFM v2.1 methodology. In partnership with Aurora, Anew designed a custom project that exceeds registry mandates and meets Microsoft’s high standards for durability and integrity, featuring extended monitoring, tech-enabled quantification, perpetual working forest easements and covenants. Collectively, this marks the largest permanent working forest protection project in the eastern U.S. in two decades..""This agreement sets a new standard for nature-based carbon removals, pairing technical rigor with environmental stewardship at scale,"" said Angela Schwarz, Chief Executive Officer of Anew Climate. ""Microsoft’s collaboration enables innovation that benefits the broader market and accelerates our collective path to net zero."".At a time when high-quality nature- and technology-based carbon removals remain in limited supply, this agreement stands out for its immediate impact, as material volumes of removal credits will begin being delivered in 2025..""Aurora Sustainable Lands is distinctive because we are the landowner and operator, managing everything from root to credit. This comprehensive approach ensures the highest integrity and quality of our carbon credits,"" said Jamie Houston, CEO of Aurora Sustainable Lands.

2025-06-19 04:03:00,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta","CoreWeave has surged 300% since IPO and now tops Nvidia's price, but is the AI newcomer worth the hype?","Chicago, IL – June 25, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, CoreWeave CRWV, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META..Backed by Nvidia, CoreWeave stock has skyrocketed more than +300% since launching its IPO in late March, as investor confidence has swooned for the AI cloud infrastructure company. To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia..Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage..Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares..Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-070000205.html," The primary risk associated with CoreWeave's situation revolves around the potential overvaluation due to market hype compared to its competitor, Nvidia. Here's a structured analysis:  1. **Market Risk**: The significant stock growth of CoreWeave could attract more attention and investment, potentially leading to further volatility or mispricing in the market.  2. **Competitive Risk**: While CoreWeave has shown strong performance, its ability to compete with established companies like Nvidia is uncertain. There's a risk that competitors might not adopt their technology as quickly, leading to market share erosion.  3. **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in government regulations concerning AI technologies could impact CoreWeave's operations and potentially its stock price if regulations become more stringent or if there are new competitive pressures.  4. **Financial Risk**: The company's growth of 300% since IPO suggests high returns, but sustainability is uncertain. There's a risk that this success might be short-lived, possibly due to overvaluation or unforeseen challenges.  In conclusion, the risk lies in whether CoreWeave can sustain its current trajectory and justify the hype surrounding it against competitors with significant market presence and established technology leadership."

While its revenue growth has reached 24% on a trailing twelve-month basis, the company continues to operate inefficiently, posting net losses that hover around 80% of revenue and maintaining negative cash flow. With a Rule of 40 score of just 14%, the business model remains fundamentally flawed..A major concern is C3.ai’s reliance on a limited customer base, most notably Baker Hughes, which contributes around 20% of total revenue. This key contract is set for renewal and may expire as early as June 2025, posing a significant risk to the company’s financial stability and stock performance. For fiscal year 2025, C3.ai is projected to generate nearly $400 million in sales while incurring a $300 million loss, a mismatch that renders its $2.5 billion valuation difficult to justify..The market appears to share this skepticism, as evidenced by a 30% drop in the stock year-to-date. Furthermore, substantial insider selling by CEO Tom Siebel and his management team reinforces concerns about internal confidence. Short sellers have also targeted the stock aggressively, as reflected in its elevated short interest levels..Tools like the stocks.

(GTLB) on High Growth Investing’s Substack by Stefan Waldhauser. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTLB. GitLab Inc. (GTLB)'s share was trading at $41.23 as of 13th June. GTLB’s trailing and forward P/E were 458.11 and 54.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..A software engineer working on coding a mobile app from their workstation..GitLab stands out in the DevSecOps landscape by positioning itself as an AI-native platform built for enterprise-grade needs in an increasingly regulated and cloud-diverse world. Unlike GitHub, which is deeply embedded within Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem, GitLab offers cloud neutrality with the flexibility to run across AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises environments..This appeals especially to government entities and organizations requiring dedicated SaaS instances, with GitLab recently achieving FedRAMP certification—a move that unlocks large-scale federal contracts. GitLab Duo, the company's AI-native suite, embeds contextual intelligence throughout the software lifecycle..Features like Duo Workflow and Duo Enterprise aim to automate multi-step developer tasks, offer test generation and root cause analysis, and ease deployment, all signaling GitLab's evolution from a DevOps tool to the operational backbone of modern software factories. Despite a deceleration in revenue growth from 36% in FY24 to an expected 25% in FY26, GitLab’s fundamentals remain strong with a near 90% gross margin and improving cash flow now that a major tax-related one-time hit is behind it..At a $41 share price, the stock trades at 6x forward sales—its lowest valuation since IPO—yet remains attractively priced relative to SaaS peers. Alphabet’s venture arm, GV recently exited its stake, dampening takeover speculation, but GitLab’s strategic value appears undiminished..With a growing foothold among enterprise customers and an increasingly integrated AI product suite, GitLab is positioned as a long-term structural winner in software development.

(GTLB) based on the provided news highlights several key points:  1. **High Valuation**: The trailing P/E ratio of 458.11 indicates that the company is trading at a premium based on past earnings, which can lead to market volatility if investor sentiment shifts or there are negative developments.  2. **Potential Decline**: The high valuations pose a risk of significant stock price drops if there are any adverse events or changes in market sentiment affecting investor confidence.  3. **Sector Sensitivity**: As a cloud infrastructure company, GitLab's performance is susceptible to broader economic factors such as interest rates, competition from other providers (like AWS or Azure), and regulatory changes that could impact the industry.  4. **Uncertain Growth Projections**: While the thesis suggests high growth potential, it might not be sustainable in the long term if there are no solid fundamentals or clear evidence of continued robust earnings growth.  5. **Forward P/E Ratio**: Although slightly lower than the trailing ratio at 54.95, this still reflects elevated expectations for future earnings, which could potentially underperform if those expectations do not materialize.  **Conclusion**: The primary risks revolve around the potential for a significant decline due to overvaluation and the associated uncertainties in cloud infrastructure growth. Investors should consider these factors carefully when evaluating whether to proceed with an investment in GitLab Inc."

This could lead to unexpected market movements and increased risk for portfolios not well-diversified in technology.  2. **Concentration Risk**: If an investor is heavily invested in tech stocks without diversification, a sharp reversal or significant downturn in the sector could result in substantial losses.  3. **Sentiment Impact**: While the price rise may indicate positive sentiment, it can also be a reaction to news that might not sustain long-term. Investors should consider whether this movement reflects fundamentals or is part of broader market dynamics.  In conclusion, while tech stocks' upward trend offers potential gains, it also introduces risks related to sector-specific volatility and concentration exposure in portfolios."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Meta Launches Xbox Edition of Its Quest VR Headset,Meta's looking to make a bigger push into VR gaming.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Meta’s looking to boost the appeal of VR gaming, with a new Xbox-branded Meta Quest bundle, created in partnership with Microsoft, which will enable gamers to get their hands on a limited edition, Xbox-themed Quest headset..As you can see in this example, the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition comes in a sleek-looking black colorway, and includes a matching Xbox controller in the set. .But not an Xbox itself. .As per Meta:.“Today, Meta and Xbox are teaming up to unveil the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition - a celebration of Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) on Quest. Retailing for $US399.99, this limited edition bundle includes a custom 128GB Meta Quest 3S in signature Xbox Carbon Black and Velocity Green with matching Touch Plus controllers, a limited edition Xbox controller, an Elite Strap, and a 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.”.So, to clarify, the regular price of a Meta Quest 3S headset is $US299, while an Xbox One controller costs around $US49.99. Add to this the 3-months of Xbox Live access ($US24.99) and it’s not actually a bargain, in terms of price. But the color looks cool, and you can bet that some Xbox fans will be keen to purchase the limited edition design, as part of their gaming set-up..And as Meta points out, Meta Quest already integrates Xbox functionality, effectively: .“Meta Quest is an Xbox - and has been for a couple of years now, ever since we partnered with Microsoft to launch the Xbox app on Quest. Put on your Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, and you can play hundreds of Xbox games like South of Midnight, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Avowed, and Towerborne on a larger-than-life screen. And of course, you can play all the incredible immersive experiences across gaming and entertainment from the Meta Horizon Store.”.Yeah, in terms of value, it’s not actually that great of a package, but really, the pitch here is not that this is a great deal, as such, but rather that this is a better alternative than buying an Xbox..Which seems like a bit of a conflict for Microsoft, but presumably, it's getting a fair share of revenue from the collaboration..And again, it’s another means for Meta to boost the appeal of its VR headset with the gaming community, by integrating its advanced headset with Xbox more directly, and inviting gamers to accessorize their set-up with a VR unit. .And while Meta has broader ambitions for its VR experience, gaming remains a key gateway for adoption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-launches-xbox-edition-quest-170738470.html," Based on a comprehensive analysis of the potential risks associated with Meta launching its Xbox Edition of the Quest VR headset, several key factors emerge:  1. **Regulatory Compliance Risks**: Differences in regulatory requirements between Meta and Xbox could lead to complications, such as differing return policies or distribution standards, potentially affecting consumer experience.  2. **Brand Reputation and User Experience**: The success of the product heavily depends on its performance and user-friendliness. If there are issues with quality or usability, it could damage the reputation of both brands.  3. **Competitive Pressure**: With a saturated VR market, the Xbox Edition might face competition from other notable brands like Oculus, PlayStation, and Nintendo. Failing to differentiate effectively could lead to market disruption.  4. **Supply Chain Challenges**: Reliance on reliable suppliers for production ensures smooth release; any supply chain issues could delay delivery or affect product quality.  5. **Legal and Compliance Issues**: Differences in legal terms, such as support and warranty conditions, between Meta and Xbox could introduce legal complexities and headaches.  6. **Cannibalization of Existing Products**: Introducing a competing product might divert customers from existing models like the Quest 2, potentially harming sales and perceived exclusivity.  In conclusion, launching an Xbox Edition presents several risks that could impact both Meta's and Xbox's reputations and market performance."

The company's proprietary supercomputers, full suite of AI solutions, and competitive pricing mean that revenues will soar in the coming years.","Zacks Rank #3 stock Nebius Group (NBIS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure company that offers its customers a full-stack AI solution. Currently, Nebius AI is benefitting from the hottest and fastest-growing area on Wall Street – AI infrastructure. Essentially, the company provides the backbone and compute power for companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) that are building the most powerful AI systems in the world, like the ChatGPT and Gemini large language models (LLMs). Building and training these complex, technologically advanced AI systems requires a massive amount of computer power and equipment..In simple terms, Nebius is akin to a specialized electricity company, but rather than providing power, the company provides the lightning-fast computer power and technology needed for AI. However, what makes Nebius special and unique is how they offer their products:.·       NBIS has its own supercomputers: Nebius builds and operates its own data centers that it fills with the latest and most advanced graphic processing units (GPUS). In other words, rather than building their own data centers and setting up the complex AI technology themselves, big tech companies like Microsoft can rely on NBIS data centers and use them as a service..·       NBIS has competitive pricing: Because Nebius is focused solely on AI solutions, the company can provide more competitive pricing than general cloud providers, for example..·       NBIS offers supplemental products: Nebius’s laser-focus on AI also allows the company to offer a full suite of products that extend beyond just compute power. Its add-on software solutions make running AI models simpler and more efficient..Nebius AI builds proprietary hardware like servers and racks, allowing it to vertically integrate its business. In addition, NBIS has partnered with Nvidia (NVDA) (the top AI chip company) to leverage the industry-best Nvidia GPUs and access powerful ‘GPU clusters’ to run AI models at scale. Meanwhile, Nebius also has an essential partnership with big tech juggernaut Meta Platforms (META). Meta leverages NBIS technology to train its Llama large language model. While the details of the partnership are under wraps, investors should not underestimate the significance of the partnership. META and its iconic CEO Mark Zuckerberg not only spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI, Zuckerberg is so serious about AI that recent reports claim that he has been poaching top AI talent from other AI leaders, offering staggering $100 million pay packages as incentive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nebius-ai-infrastructure-leader-165900988.html," Based on the analysis of Nebius's position as an AI infrastructure leader in a booming market, the primary risks identified are:  1. **Competition**: The entry of established and emerging players could erode Nebius's competitive edge. 2. **Regulatory Changes**: Rapid shifts in regulations could impact their business model or operations. 3. **Supply Chain Issues**: Increased demand may lead to supply chain disruptions affecting production and costs.  These risks highlight the need for strategic planning to mitigate challenges while leveraging market growth opportunities."

EW’s trailing and forward P/E were 31.55 and 31.25 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a global leader in structural heart therapies, generating 60% of its revenue internationally and maintaining a focused mission on treating advanced cardiovascular disease..With a 20-year track record of 14.5% annual growth, the company trades at a 32x P/E, a valuation level akin to Microsoft, though with comparatively slower growth. This premium suggests the market sees a durable moat, albeit a narrow one, anchored in intangible assets such as a respected brand and clinical leadership in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology. Moderate switching costs further reinforce this position, as physicians tend to stick with TAVR systems after overcoming steep learning curves..While the company lacks cost advantages, network effects, or efficient scale, it remains highly modelable, with limited earnings volatility and consistent operational performance. Its fair value estimate sits around $84, based on projected 2025–2026 EPS and historical multiples, implying the current share price offers an 8% discount and modest total return expectations of 25% (or ~9% annually)..What sets Edwards apart is exceptional capital discipline and management. It maintains a conservative balance sheet, prioritizes internal innovation with industry-leading R&D investment, and has a history of strategic, early-stage acquisitions that support future growth in mitral and tricuspid valve markets. Though it does not pay a dividend, its opportunistic buyback strategy reflects prudent capital return.

CoreWeave now has a data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power..CRWV is witnessing explosive revenue growth on strong AI demand. In the last earnings call, management highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. In the last reported quarter, revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave..CRWV’s strong backlog of $25.9 billion underscores its growing market share. This includes a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion, while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter..Nonetheless, the competitive landscape is the biggest concern. Also, higher capex can be a concern if revenues do not keep up the required pace to sustain such high capital intensity. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crwv-vs-msft-ai-infrastructure-124700371.html," The risk classified in this analysis pertains to **market risk**, which involves fluctuations in stock prices due to general market conditions such as economic changes, investor sentiment, or broader market trends affecting both CRWV and MSFT differently based on their growth strategies and market positions."
2025-06-19 04:03:00,Will CRWV's Platform Upgrades Help it Take the Lead in the AI Race?,CoreWeave unveils new AI cloud software suite and next-gen infrastructure to scale amid booming global AI demand.,"CoreWeave, Inc.

It recently launched the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip capacity in Europe, boosting its global AI infrastructure and supporting AI innovation across the region. It is growing its global presence to meet the rising demand for AI infrastructure. It now has capacity in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, and added three new regions last quarter, including a key data center in Israel.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crwvs-platform-upgrades-help-lead-124200160.html," The analysis identifies several key risks CoreWeave might encounter based on their strategic move into the AI market with platform upgrades:  1. **Market Competition**: The rapid advancement of technology means that increased investment could attract competitors to match or surpass CoreWeave's lead, potentially eroding their market position.  2. **Operational Costs**: Expanding infrastructure and software requires significant financial investments, necessitating careful cost management to avoid inefficiencies or reduced profitability.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: The emergence of stringent regulations on AI technologies could pose challenges in terms of compliance, adding complexity and potential costs for CoreWeve.  4. **Reputational Risks**: Potential issues related to AI ethics, privacy, or security could damage CoreWeve's reputation if mishandled, affecting customer trust and partnerships.  In summary, while CoreWeave is strategically positioning itself for leadership in AI through upgrades, they face risks primarily from competition, operational costs, regulatory changes, and reputational concerns."

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is using AI-powered code-completion tools to help developers write code 55% faster.  Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is leveraging AI to accelerate drug-discovery timelines.,"Boring dividend stocks are becoming the smartest way to profit from AI's efficiency revolution..Companies using AI to slash costs and boost margins can sustain higher dividend payouts for decades..These five dividend payers offer current income plus the upside of AI-driven margin expansion..10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›.When companies deploy artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline operations, the results can be staggering. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is using AI-powered code-completion tools to help developers write code 55% faster. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is leveraging AI to accelerate drug-discovery timelines. IBM (NYSE: IBM) reported over $1 billion in generative AI revenue in a single quarter. These efficiency gains translate directly to the bottom line, creating sustainable cost savings that can flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks..Consider what happens when a company with $100 billion in revenue uses AI to improve efficiency by just 5%. That's $5 billion in cost savings flowing straight to the bottom line -- money that can fund dividend increases, share buybacks, and further AI investments. This virtuous cycle of AI deployment leading to margin expansion leading to shareholder rewards is already playing out across multiple industries. The five companies below have figured out how to turn AI from a buzzword into a profit-generating machine that benefits patient dividend investors..Microsoft offers a modest 0.68% yield today, but don't let that fool you. With a rock-solid 24.4% payout ratio, the company has massive room to grow its dividend as AI supercharges its business. Microsoft isn't just selling AI through Azure and its OpenAI partnership -- it's using AI internally to optimize everything from coding to customer service. When a company generating $245 billion in annual revenue finds ways to boost efficiency by even 10%, that's $24.5 billion in potential savings flowing straight to the bottom line..IBM yields 2.38% and has raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years, though its 114.2% payout ratio demands attention. The company's aggressive pivot to AI and hybrid cloud is already bearing fruit, with generative AI revenue jumping over $1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 alone. While the high payout ratio suggests IBM is stretching to maintain its long dividend growth streak, the AI-driven revenue growth could quickly bring that ratio back to sustainable levels. Watson's evolution from a game show novelty to an enterprise AI powerhouse shows IBM still has innovation in its DNA.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-stocks-poised-profit-120000767.html," The news highlights dividend-paying companies benefiting from AI-driven efficiency gains, but as an investor, there are several risks to consider:  1. **Concentration Risk**: The growth in dividends may be concentrated among a few high-performing companies like Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. This could lead to higher risk if these sectors or companies face challenges.  2. **Technological Dependency**: These companies rely heavily on AI technology for efficiency gains. Future disruptions or obsolescence of their current AI models could impact their performance.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: The use of AI may raise concerns about data privacy and security, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential impacts on operations.  4. **Economic Conditions**: Economic downturns or reduced consumer spending might affect investments in AI projects without impacting core operations, potentially affecting profit margins.  5. **Inflation Risks**: Inflation could reduce the profitability of companies by eroding profit margins, making dividend sustainability harder.  6. **Market Sentiment and Bubbles**: Increased investment interest may cause valuations to rise, leading to potential market corrections if overvalued.  7. **Competition Intensification**: Emerging competitors or new entrants with innovative AI solutions could reduce the marginal benefits these companies currently enjoy.  These risks suggest that while the news is positive for specific companies, investors should be aware of the associated challenges and diversify their portfolios to mitigate these risks."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,"As job expectations grow, workers battle an ‘infinite workday,’ Microsoft says","To address the issue, employers can look into how time is spent, how work gets done and what really drives impact, according to the report.","This story was originally published on HR Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily HR Dive newsletter. .Workers now face a “seemingly infinite workday,” where they scan emails before getting out of bed in the morning, attend countless meetings throughout the day and catch up on work during the evenings and weekends, according to a June 17 report from Microsoft..For instance, mass emails with 20 or more recipients have increased 7% in the past year, Teams messages per person grew 6% year over year globally, and evening meetings held after 8 p.m. have increased 16% year over year as well..“This points to a larger truth: the modern workday for many has no clear start or finish,” according to the report. “As business demands grow more complex and expectations continue to rise, time once reserved for focus or recovery may now be spent catching up, prepping and chasing clarity.”.Based on Microsoft data, employees receive an average of 117 emails per day and 153 Teams messages per workday. About 57% of meetings are ad hoc, or called in the moment without a calendar invitation..Half of meetings take place between 9-11 a.m. and 1-3 p.m., which are considered the most productive hours for workers based on their circadian rhythms. Message activity also increases during the time, leaving little time for deep focus work, Microsoft said..Telemetry data indicates that employees using Microsoft 365 are interrupted every two minutes by a meeting, email or chat notification, adding up to 275 times per day..In the evening, 29% of employees check their email again after 10 p.m. Nearly 20% of employees actively working on the weekend tend to check their email before noon on Saturday and Sunday. More than 5% also check email on Sunday evenings..Overall, 1 in 3 employees said the pace of work during the past five years has “made it impossible to keep up,” Microsoft said..In response, employers should question how time is spent, how work gets done and what really drives impact, according to the report. For instance, companies can use the 80/20 Pareto principle to focus on the 20% of efforts that deliver 80% of the outcomes. This requires setting boundaries and prioritizing deep work, the report indicated..Microsoft also recommended redesigning organizational charts to focus on goals and outcomes rather than traditional silos. As part of this, departments can incorporate artificial intelligence tools to develop insights, draft reports and fill gaps, according to the report.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-expectations-grow-workers-battle-110500336.html," The news article discussing Microsoft's suggestion for an 'infinite workday' presents several key risks:  1. **Burnout Risk**: The potential for continuous, uninterrupted work leading to physical exhaustion, mental fatigue, and stress, which can negatively impact employee well-being.  2. **Employee Dissatisfaction**: Employees accustomed to fixed working hours may feel disrupted by unpredictable schedules, potentially lowering morale and increasing turnover rates.  3. **Workload Stress**: Employees might be overburdened without adequate support, leading to inefficiencies and increased stress if proper management systems aren't in place.  4. **Cultural Impact**: A culture centered around never-ending work could foster a negative atmosphere, hinder creativity, and create instability within the team.  These risks highlight the need for careful management and support structures to ensure that employees can maintain productivity and well-being while adapting to flexible work models."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,There Are Currently Better Options Than Microsoft,The reason other Mag-7 stocks are more attractive at the moment.,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies, belonging to the mag-7 and being the biggest company in the world according to market capitalization. While MSFT is definitely a great company, this article will show why it currently is not a buy for me, mainly because there are better deals in other mag-7 companies at lower valuations and better fundamentals..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96%..The same can also be said for growth. While MSFT is not as far ahead of other companies as it was in terms of profitability, a revenue growth rate of 14.13% and an EBITDA growth rate of 19.16% are still great. Furthermore, forward growth rates are even stronger than current ones, suggesting a positive outlook. Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE growth expected to be negative..As with all Mag-7 companies, valuation is the biggest problem for Microsoft. Everyone already knows that we are talking about a great company, so the most important thing to get right is to find a good entrance price. Currently, the EV/EBITDA ratio of the stock is relatively high at 22.8, a 31% premium to the industry median. Moreover, the P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium, respectively. The P/E ratio at 35.11 is also very high at the moment. Figure 1 shows the historical P/E ratio of MSFT as can be seen, the company currently trades at 2020 and 2023 levels, leaving it at a higher bound of its average valuation..When comparing Microsoft's user base to that of other Mag-7 companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), one can instantly see that the company's valuation is elevated.

Leading companies across semiconductors, cloud services, and software are seeing surging demand. Investors that stick with quality companies with strong fundamentals and a history of delivering returns to shareholders will do well over the long term. Here are two top stocks to consider adding to your portfolio right now..ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is playing a pivotal role in helping companies transform their operations for AI. Its cloud-based platform offers powerful tools that can automate and streamline workflows..ServiceNow generates recurring revenue from subscriptions, which means lower business risk compared to companies that have to sell more products every year to generate growth. Over the last 10 years, revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 32%, with free cash flow growing at 44%. This fueled a 1,100% cumulative return in the share price. Its recent quarterly revenue growth rate suggest there is still massive market potential for its platform..In the first quarter, subscription revenue grew 19% year over year to $3 billion, or an increase of 20% excluding currency changes. Importantly, remaining performance obligations grew 25% over the year-ago quarter to $22 billion, indicating excellent long-term growth prospects..ServiceNow is integrating AI across its platform, improving efficiency and productivity, which companies are desperately seeking to stay competitive. The company is moving beyond its historical focus on information technology solutions to expand into supply chain and customer relationship management offerings..These additional services are making the platform more robust to attract larger enterprises, and it's paying off. ServiceNow now has more than 500 customers with an annual contract value of $5 million or more..Management believes the opportunity for the company is accelerating. It sees a clear path to reach annual revenue of $30 billion. That represents significant growth over the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $11.5 billion..ServiceNow's history of growth, subscription-based business model, and momentum from AI integration make it a quality growth stock to hold for the long term..Another stock to invest in AI without taking a lot of risk is the long-reigning software king, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Microsoft's transformation over the last decade into a cloud-first company has significantly strengthened its competitive moat and positioned it well for the AI era.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-081500442.html," The analysis reveals that while the news about AI stocks presents promising growth opportunities, it also introduces several risks:  1. **Concentration Risk**: The recommendation to buy top AI stocks may lead to over-investment in a few companies, increasing vulnerability if their performance declines unexpectedly.  2. **Market Sentiment and Bubble Formation**: Increased interest from investors could cause the market for these stocks to rise artificially, potentially leading to a subsequent crash when sentiment shifts.  3. **Sector-Specific Uncertainties**: Although growth is highlighted, unexpected challenges such as technological obsolescence or regulatory changes in specific sectors (e.g., semiconductors) could impact performance.  In conclusion, while the news indicates positive developments, it carries significant investment risk due to potential market volatility and concentration exposure."

In April 2025, xAI launched Grok Studio, a split-screen workspace that lets users collaborate with Grok on generating documents, code, reports, and browser games. It also launched the ability to create Workspaces that let you organize files and conversations in a single place..While OpenAI and Microsoft have similar tools, Google’s Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building. Google’s tools can edit Docs and Sheets and allow you to chat with Gemini while looking at or editing documents. The difference is that Gemini Workspace only works within Google’s ecosystem..It’s not clear what types of files xAI’s editor might support aside from spreadsheets, or whether xAI plans to build a full productivity suite that could compete with Google Workspace or Microsoft 365..If Owji’s findings are true, the advanced editor would be a step toward Elon Musk’s ambitions to turn X into an “everything app” that includes docs, chat, payments, and social media.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leak-reveals-grok-might-soon-181657484.html," The leak about Grok's xAI project presents multiple types of risks:  1. **Market Risk**: Concerns Grok's competitive position in the AI-driven productivity tools market.  2. **Operational Risk**: Involves potential costs and challenges related to integrating new AI capabilities into their products.  3. **Strategic Risk**: May lead to regulatory issues, necessitating partnerships or quick action to stay competitive.  4. **Financial Risk**: Includes possible costs, legal issues, and revenue risks due to the new product's success.

All seven stocks are included in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, and they often drive the market's performance with their size, growth, and influence..But after years of big gains, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their luster. Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which is vulnerable to high tariffs, competition, and supply chain constraints. Amazon faces stiff competition from cheaper cross-border competitors, Alphabet's Google is being slammed by antitrust regulators and struggling to keep pace with OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) services, and Microsoft might be headed for an ugly breakup with OpenAI as the AI start-up openly rebels against its top investor. As for Tesla, Elon Musk's divisive actions are likely driving away its potential customers in the saturated EV market..Meta and Nvidia face fewer near-term headwinds than the other five stocks. However, Meta generates nearly all of its revenue from ads, and its growth could slow down as the global economy cools off. Nvidia certainly isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but the secular expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset a lot of that pressure. So looking ahead, I believe Nvidia will continue to shatter Wall Street's expectations and outperform the other Magnificent Seven stocks for the foreseeable future..Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. It designs its own chips, but it outsources its manufacturing to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. With that ""fabless"" model, Nvidia doesn't need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade its own foundries or develop the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient manufacturing nodes..Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, which can also be used to mine certain cryptocurrencies. But in its latest quarter, it generated less than 9% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs. A whopping 89% came from its data center GPUs -- which include its older A100 chips and current-gen H100 and H200 chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/predict-magnificent-seven-stock-crush-163300908.html," Based on the analysis of the news article reflecting NVIDIA potentially outperforming while other six stocks underperform, the type of risk is **market volatility or competitive market dynamics**.  This scenario implies that there could be significant fluctuations in market performance due to the relative success or failure of one stock compared to others. The potential risks include:  1. **Increased market instability**: If NVIDIA performs well while others fall, it may lead to a sharp increase in market volatility as investors react to these developments. 2. **Investor sentiment shifts**: The outperformance of NVIDIA could cause a sell-off among other stocks, potentially leading to a broader correction or decline in the market. 3. **Increased competition**: If other stocks underperform, they might intensify their competition for investor attention and capital, creating a more dynamic and unpredictable market environment.  Overall, while there is no direct mention of a specific risk type (e.g., equity risk, interest rate risk), the scenario inherently introduces risks related to market dynamics."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Will Nebius Achieve its $1B ARR and Up to $700M Revenue Targets?,"NBIS posts 385% Q1 revenue growth, eyes up to $1B ARR for 2025 as AI demand surges and global expansion accelerates.","Nebius Group N.V. NBIS has captured investor attention with its explosive growth and ambitious 2025 targets of $750 million to $1 billion in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) and $500–$700 million in total revenues. Following a remarkable 385% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025 and a 700% surge in ARR, the company appears well-positioned to pursue its goals. ARR reached $310 million in April, indicating strong momentum for the second quarter..The company is gaining from solid growth in its core artificial intelligence (AI) business. As organizations increasingly invest in generative AI, Nebius is benefiting from a full-stack approach, offering everything from high-performance GPU cloud infrastructure to Saturn Cloud’s MLOps platform and AI development tools..Backed by a $700 million funding round involving high-profile investors like NVIDIA and Accel in December 2024, Nebius is expanding aggressively in North America and Europe. It aims to leverage this capital to meet customer demand while maintaining flexibility in pricing and cost management. In June 2025, NBIS announced private placement of $1 billion in convertible notes to capitalize on the AI-infrastructure boom and drive-up revenue opportunities in 2026..The company holds a minority stake of approximately 28% in ClickHouse. Recent media reports suggest that a fundraising round is currently in progress, potentially valuing ClickHouse at around $6 billion. The company expects adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in the second half of 2025..Global demand for AI-specific infrastructure is booming, with hyperscalers, startups and enterprises increasing GPU investments. Per IDC’s forecast, AI infrastructure spending is projected to reach $223 billion by 2028, with servers deployed in cloud environments accounting for 82% of the total market and accelerated servers comprising approximately 74% of total market spending..That said, increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties may adversely impact NBIS’ growth trajectory. Nebius competes with technology giants like CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV and Microsoft Corporation MSFT..CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been designed to scale, support and accelerate GenAI. The company expects revenues for 2025 to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. CoreWeave anticipates capital expenditures of $20 billion to $23 billion, reflecting accelerated investment in its infrastructure to meet growing customer demand. This guidance incorporates the impact of several key developments, including the OpenAI contract signed in March, a $4 billion expansion agreement with a major AI enterprise and the integration of Weights & Biases into its platform strategy. At present, it has a network of 33 purpose-built AI-data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nebius-achieve-1b-arr-700m-134500093.html," The analysis identifies several risks associated with Nebsius's ambitious growth targets:  1. **Market Volatility**: The company has set aggressive revenue and ARR targets ($700M by 2025 and $1B ARR), which could be influenced by one-time high revenues, potentially leading to inconsistent future performance.  2. **Global Expansion Risks**: The expansion into global markets involves uncertainties such as geopolitical risks, supply chain disruptions, and cultural differences that might hinder growth or profitability.  3. **Competitive Pressure**: Global competition from other AI companies may erode Nebsius's market share and revenue, posing a challenge in meeting its high targets.  In conclusion, while the ambitious targets represent significant potential for NBIS, these risks highlight vulnerabilities to market fluctuations, competitive pressures, and global operational challenges."
2025-06-19 04:03:00,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Microsoft (MSFT): Should You Buy?,"According to the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), one should invest in Microsoft (MSFT). It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT)..Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.28, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.28 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 38 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80.9% and 10.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>.The ABR suggests buying Microsoft, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133002074.html," The analysis indicates that while Wall Street's optimistic recommendations for Microsoft (MSFT) suggest potential growth, several risks are present:  1. **Market Timing Risk**: The positive outlook might be based on an uptrend, which could lead to overvaluation as prices may hit a high and face resistance.  2. **Bullwhip Effect**: The recommendations could drive the market higher, creating a speculative bubble that may burst if fundamentals change or negative news surfaces.  3. **Reliance on Fundamentals**: The stock's performance might depend heavily on strong yet unproven fundamentals, which could weaken in the future.  4. **Sentiment Swings**: Market sentiment can shift rapidly; the recommendations might change abruptly without solid justification.  5. **Herding Behavior**: Over-reliance on analyst recommendations could lead to irrational decisions based solely on collective behavior rather than individual analysis.  In conclusion, while positive recommendations offer an attractive opportunity, these risks suggest that investors should consider the balance of potential overvaluation and speculative risks before making a decision."

Given these factors, while consumer interest in AI stocks is positive, there are significant risks associated with relying on this hype for investment decisions."
2025-06-19 04:03:00,C3.ai Ramps Up Partner-Led Sales Model: Can It Drive Scalable Growth?,AI's accelerating partner-led strategy with tech giants like Microsoft is driving sharp deal growth in fiscal 2025.,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is doubling down on a go-to-market strategy centered around its rapidly expanding partner ecosystem. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the company secured 73% of its agreements in collaboration with strategic partners like Microsoft, AWS and Google Cloud. In fiscal 2025, it signed 193 deals through the partner ecosystem, reflecting a rise of 68% from the prior year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, AI reported a 419% surge in partner-supported bookings, with 59 agreements closed through strategic alliances.In the fiscal fourth quarter, C3.ai closed 59 partner-led deals. The company’s deepened alliance with Microsoft is noteworthy. Its applications are listed in Azure’s sales catalog, with commissions being paid to Microsoft’s global salesforce for successful closes. In the quarter, the company inked 28 joint deals with Microsoft, emphasizing manufacturing and chemicals.To support this channel-centric push, C3.ai has invested heavily in demo licenses and enablement tools. These demo licenses — used by partners and strategic customers alike — made up nearly 30% of the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues.C3.ai is now jointly targeting over 600 accounts with Microsoft alone, and is pursuing similar scaling with AWS, Google Cloud and newly formed alliances like PwC and McKinsey QuantumBlack. The management is optimistic and anticipates the consulting partners to unlock new levels of scalability and market penetration in the upcoming periods..Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR continues to pursue a more vertically integrated model, emphasizing direct engagement with clients over an external partner-led sales approach. Palantir does collaborate with key institutions, such as R1 RCM in healthcare automation and NATO for mission-critical AI deployments. Its Maven Smart System and AIP platform are deployed directly with defense agencies and commercial clients through proprietary programs. Palantir’s partnerships are strategic in nature but limited in scale compared to the broad commercial enablement seen at C3.ai.Snowflake Inc. SNOW, in contrast, is building a hybrid model that blends direct go-to-market with strong platform partnerships. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake highlighted expanded collaboration with Microsoft, enabling customers to host OpenAI models via Azure and integrate Snowflake’s Cortex AI products into Office Copilot. The company leverages technology from its Datavolo acquisition to improve data connectivity with partners like Google Drive, Workday, Slack and SharePoint.In the public sector, Snowflake launched Snowflake Public Sector Inc. and secured Department of Defense provisional authorization, boosting offerings to the government and national security. Its model emphasizes data ecosystem interoperability, supporting structured and unstructured data across platforms and creating opportunities for seamless collaboration. While not as externally distributed as C3.ai’s, Snowflake’s partner strategy is essential for expanding AI use cases and integrations across verticals.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c3-ai-ramps-partner-led-131300848.html," The news about C3.ai's expansion into a partner-led sales model with tech giants like Microsoft involves several types of risks:  1. **Market Dependency**: The reliance on major tech companies could limit scalability if partnerships are disrupted or change.  2. **Competition Risk**: Increased competition from other AI players might affect margins and growth rates, though it may not be as significant due to the strength of existing partners.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in AI regulations could impact C3.ai's ability to operate without adjustments, potentially causing operational challenges.  4. **Strategic Dependence**: Close alignment with established companies like Microsoft might make growth too dependent on their strategies and market conditions.  5. **Deal Volume Uncertainty**: There is uncertainty about whether the projected sharp deal growth in 2025 will materialize as early adopters may struggle to convert into sustained sales.  In conclusion, while the partnership model offers potential benefits, it also presents significant risks that need careful management."
2025-06-19 04:03:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is a Trending Stock,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Microsoft (MSFT). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +6.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.35 per share, indicating a change of +13.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $13.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.97 indicates a change of +12% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-microsoft-corporation-130003128.html," The analysis of the potential risk related to Microsoft's upcoming news involves several key considerations:  1. **Product Launches**: An upcoming product launch could be seen as positive news if it aligns with investor expectations of innovation and growth, but negative if it fails to meet those expectations.  2. **Regulatory Changes**: Regulatory developments, such as new laws or challenges to existing policies, could impact Microsoft's operations and profitability, potentially leading to significant risks.  3. **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)**: Announcements of mergers or divestitures can affect stock prices due to potential synergies or changes in valuation of acquired assets.  4. **Supply Chain Issues**: Disruptions in global supply chains could increase costs and operational delays, impacting profits and stock performance.  5. **Cybersecurity Initiatives**: Significant cybersecurity efforts, especially in a high-risk environment, could be viewed positively, but any compromises might have adverse effects.  6. **Economic Indicators**: Shifts in the economy can influence investor sentiment towards tech stocks. A strong report affecting growth sectors like tech might drive interest in Microsoft's stock.  7. **Fiscal Policy Changes**: Government policies on innovation or infrastructure spending could impact confidence and investment in tech companies.  8. **Intellectual Property Developments**: New technologies or patent battles could disrupt the industry, affecting stock performance.  9. **Earnings Reports**: Positive earnings with already priced-in expectations might lead to risks of disappointment later, while solid earnings could drive higher future expectations.  10. **Market Volatility**: Macroeconomic uncertainties affecting the broader market can impact Microsoft's stock regardless of company-specific news.  11. **Competitive Landscape**: New competitors or challenges from existing ones could alter Microsoft's market position and profitability.  12. **Investor Sentiment**: The emotional reaction to news, especially a mix of positive and negative developments, can create uncertainty and add risk.  In conclusion, while the upcoming news may attract investor attention due to various positive factors, potential risks include regulatory challenges, macroeconomic conditions, and any adverse reactions to the news itself. These elements interplay in creating an overall risk assessment for Microsoft's stock performance."

Its corporate clients provide reliable revenue and high customer retention.  There are few companies as renowned as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).,"Microsoft has one of the most diversified businesses in all of the tech world..Its corporate clients provide reliable revenue and high customer retention..The company has navigated some of the country's toughest economic times..10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›.There are few companies as renowned as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That's what helped it achieve a market cap of over $3.5 trillion and sit as the world's most valuable public company (as of June 19)..Despite Microsoft's decades of success, the future remains bright, and there is still plenty of room for growth. If you're considering buying Microsoft shares, here are 10 reasons to do so -- and never sell..Microsoft has its hands in seemingly every corner of the tech world. From productivity software to cloud computing to hardware to social media to gaming, Microsoft has no shortage of revenue streams. This helps ensure Microsoft doesn't rely too heavily on one segment and helps it weather market cycles that affect specific businesses or industries..In the third quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended March 31), Microsoft made around $70 billion in revenue and had a net income of $25.8 billion. Considering Microsoft's size, the growth of both of these over the past decade has been impressive..Having a large corporate client base helps provide reliable and recurring revenue because they often have longer-term contracts. In many cases, it's not easy for corporations to switch from Microsoft because they rely too much on it for their daily operations. This helps with Microsoft's customer retention..Microsoft might not get the dividend stock label, but it has been paying one for 22 years. And even better: It has increased the annual payout for 20 consecutive years. If you're holding this stock forever, you can bet on this trend continuing. I fully expect Microsoft to eventually become a Dividend King..Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI that makes its cloud platform, Azure, the exclusive cloud provider for its artificial intelligence (AI) models. In return, Microsoft gets special access to OpenAI's AI technology, allowing it to integrate it into its large suite of products..Microsoft Azure is the world's second-largest cloud service platform, trailing Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, remains only marginally positive for the year. Volatility is expected to persist in the second half..Let’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:.On April 2, Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs dubbed “Liberation Day” tariffs. These included a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imports, with a few exceptions such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber. On top of the baseline, Trump introduced “reciprocal” tariffs that targeted specific countries. China faced tariffs ranging from 34% to 54%, the European Union 20%, Japan 24% and Vietnam up to 46%. These tariffs officially took effect on April 9..Facing backlash and international criticism, the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for over 75 countries on May 12, though the 10% baseline tariff remained in place. Additionally, Chinese tariffs were reduced from a peak of 145% to around 30%, though they remained substantially elevated. On May 30, Trump doubled tariffs on imported steel, raising them from 25% to 50%, citing national security concerns and the need to protect U.S. industry..These actions faced legal scrutiny. On May 28, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that many of the tariffs were illegal under international trade law. However, the court also issued a stay, meaning the tariffs would remain in place pending appeals.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-palantir-094400708.html," The news article highlights potential risks associated with investments in Palantir, Newmont, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and AngloGold Ashanti due to various market factors:  1. **Market Volatility**: The first half of 2025 is expected to be volatile, increasing uncertainty and risk for investors holding these companies' stocks.  2. **AI Sector Impact**: Companies like Palantir and NVIDIA are in AI-driven sectors, which may experience rapid changes, leading to stock price instability.  3. **Gold Policy Changes**: AngloGold Ashanti's reliance on precious metals makes it vulnerable to shifts in gold policy and demand, adding volatility risk.  4. **Cyclical Business Nature**: Newmont operates in a capital-intensive mining industry with cyclical demands influenced by economic conditions, posing investment risks during downturns.  **Conclusion**: The primary risk is systematic market risk due to the first half of 2025's volatility affecting multiple sectors and companies. This risk impacts the broader stock markets and varies per company based on their specific business cycles and exposures."

Even with an occasional underperforming year sprinkled in here and there, the Oracle of Omaha has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,884,143%, as of the closing bell on June 18. For the sake of comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed by around 40,000%, including dividends, since the mid-1960s..Such an overwhelming outperformance of Wall Street's encompassing stock index has professional and everyday investors riding Buffett's coattails to long-term gains. This can be done by tracking Berkshire Hathaway's trading activity via quarterly filed Form 13Fs and mirroring it..Buffett's investment success isn't based on luck, and a nearly 5,884,143% cumulative return doesn't happen by accident. It's the result of Berkshire's CEO sticking to a set of unwritten rules that guide his investment philosophy. While some of these ""rules"" have proved fungible, on rare occasion, throughout the years, there's one investing rule the Oracle of Omaha refuses to bend -- and it fully explains why he's been a net seller of stocks since October 2022..One of the most tried-and-true investment philosophies Warren Buffett lives by is the idea of long-term investing. Instead of trying to guess when short-lived stock market corrections, bear markets, or economic recessions will take place, he purchases businesses or makes acquisitions that can take advantage of long-winded periods of growth. Some of Buffett's top-performing investments, in terms of unrealized gains, have been held for multiple decades, such as Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody's..But even Berkshire's billionaire CEO has been tempted by a short-term trade before. During Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual meeting, Buffett told attendees that his company's stake in gaming colossus Activision Blizzard, which was subsequently acquired by Microsoft for $95 per share in cash, was for arbitrage purposes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-investing-rule-warren-buffett-070600016.html," The news article about Warren Buffett's investing rule discusses a specific warning related to his $174 billion warning to Wall Street. This warning is associated with his cautious approach to investments, particularly high-risk ones. The risk involved here pertains to his willingness to invest in speculative or high-risk ventures that offer the potential for significant returns but come with inherent volatility and leverage.  Buffett's risk involves taking calculated risks in areas such as emerging markets, private companies, or industries where he expects substantial growth despite high exposure. These investments are characterized by their potential for exponential returns but also carry the risk of significant losses if valuations drop or market conditions turn unfavorable. Buffet's approach emphasizes diversification and margin of safety, which he applies to mitigate these risks.  In essence, the risk is the speculative nature of his investments in high-volatility sectors with the expectation of high returns, requiring careful assessment of market conditions, company fundamentals, and macroeconomic factors."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Nvidia: How the chipmaker evolved from a gaming startup to an AI giant,"Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI.","Over the past two decades, Nvidia (NVDA) has skyrocketed into global conversation..The semiconductor company is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)..Beyond its strengths in the gaming, data, and AI fields, Nvidia announced plans this March for a quantum research center in Boston, where CEO Jensen Huang said researchers could tackle problems from drug discovery to materials development..Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI..On April 5, 1993, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia with an initial focus on designing and producing 3D graphics processors for computing and video games..The company’s first product release, the multimedia processor NV1, didn’t get the reception the founders were hoping for. What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html," Based on the analysis, the primary risks associated with Nvidia's evolution from a gaming startup to an AI giant are:  1. **Market Risk**: The potential volatility in investor sentiment and market performance due to the transition into AI chips versus staying in gaming trends.  2. **Competitive Risk**: The increased competition from other tech companies like AMD or Intel, which could affect Nvidia's market share and position.  Other risks such as regulatory, cybersecurity, reputational, economic downturns, supply chain issues, and environmental/economic risks are not directly mentioned but could be potential factors depending on broader market conditions."

The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years.","Amazon has a clear path toward a $3 trillion market cap through its cloud computing growth and AI investments..While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years..The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.While not all have stayed there, there have been three tech giants that have crossed the $3 trillion market cap threshold: Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream.

The recent college graduate – an employee in the IT industry – is at a mandatory team dinner..“I end up working late almost every day,” laughs Lee. “By the end of the day, I feel completely drained, like I’ve used up all my energy [and] I can’t really do anything on weekdays after work.”.She begins the workday at 9.30am and ends most days at 10pm, sometimes pushing to midnight. On a single workday, Lee receives about 200 messages. With constant meetings and collaborative work filling the day, evenings are often the only time Lee has to catch up on individual tasks..This is far from unusual, according to new research. Microsoft’s 2025 work trend index report found that many workers are increasingly grappling with “infinite workdays”, which start before sunrise and stretch late into the night. They are interrupted by some 270 pinging notifications along the way, about one every two minutes..Related: Working from home? It’s so much nicer if you’re a man | Emma Beddington.Many young professionals are struggling with this new reality. “If I pushed myself [too] hard one day, I try to leave work early the next day to get some rest,” Lee said. “There’s usually this unspoken pressure not to work from home, even if it’s allowed, but I do it anyway because I have so much work, [so] commuting feels like a waste of time, and I am just exhausted.”.This traditional work culture is disillusioning gen Z as 94% of the generation are prioritizing work-life balance over climbing the corporate ladder, according to research by Deloitte..Sal, a New York-based compensation specialist who declined to provide his full name for privacy reasons, believes his generation is facing new hurdles in the workplace such as rising mental health concerns, and stagnant wage increases in the face of inflating living costs..Despite these challenges, Sal, 24, said he is still expected to conform to an outdated working structure, putting in long hours without the payoff older generations had. “We’re graduating with a high amount of debt [from university] and then working a job that is burning us out, and it’s not even paying for this debt,” he said. “A lot of people my age are job hopping because they’re burnt out or cannot find longevity in their roles.”.Sal’s first year in his current role led him to seek therapy because the workload seemed to be a “constant queue” and he felt perpetually anxious despite “being in a spot that is better than most people in my generation”.

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Nvidia vs Microsoft Stock: Which Will Reach $4 Trillion First?,Both tech giants are neck and neck on the path toward the major milestone.,"Nvidia and Microsoft both benefit from the increasing spending and excitement around artificial intelligence..Nvidia maintains strong revenue growth for its data center chips..Microsoft's cloud computing revenue is accelerating while its enterprise software benefits from new AI features..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.At the end of 2024, tech analyst Dan Ives predicted Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) would all reach a $4 trillion valuation in 2025. He expected Apple to hit the mark first, followed by Nvidia, and then Microsoft. But I think he got the order reversed: Microsoft will reach a $4 trillion valuation first..Both Nvidia and Microsoft currently have market caps around $3.5 trillion, while Apple has seen its stock fall to about $3 trillion in market cap. The leading tech giants have received a clear boost from artificial intelligence (AI) spending, but Apple has struggled to make headway in advanced AI capabilities..As a result, it looks like either Nvidia or Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion valuation threshold first. And despite strong operating results from Nvidia, Microsoft looks to have the edge..Nvidia's strong results over the last few years were driven by unprecedented growth in its data center business. For the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year..The hyperscale customers like Microsoft are buying Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can produce them. In fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year..However, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including Microsoft. If those customers pull back on AI spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth..It faces plenty of challenges from other GPU makers and custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. Several of them are working to build chips for both training and inference that offer better price performance than Nvidia's all-in-one solution..So, while the GPU maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. The stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. That's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as Nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in AI, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-vs-microsoft-stock-reach-075700927.html," The analysis of the risk associated with NVIDIA and Microsoft's stock reaching $4 trillion each reveals several key factors:  1. **Market Volatility**: The comparison creates artificial pressure, potentially leading to significant price swings as one stock outpaces the other.  2. **Economic and Regulatory Risks**: Economic downturns or regulatory changes could impact their growth rates and affect stock prices.  3. **Growth Positioning**:    - NVIDIA's reliance on AI and GPUs may face saturation as more industries adopt these technologies.    - Microsoft's cloud services benefit from ongoing digital transformation but face competition, particularly from AWS.  4. **Sustainability of Growth**: Both companies' paths to $4 trillion could be influenced by external factors like market sentiment, economic conditions, and regulatory changes.  In conclusion, while both companies present significant growth potential, risks such as market volatility, economic shifts, regulatory impacts, and competitive pressures could affect their ability to reach the $4 trillion milestone."

Its share price has soared more than 2,000% since January 2023, achieving a return that would have turned a $5,000 investment into $107,000 over that period..Will Palantir shareholders see similar gains over the next decade? Here's what investors should know..Palantir provides data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) software that enables businesses to manage and make sense of complex information. Its platforms have applications across almost every industry. As an example, Archer Aviation recently adopted Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) products to improve its aircraft manufacturing capabilities, and the companies will collaborate to design critical aviation systems in the future..Forrester Research recognized Palantir as a leader in AI and machine learning platforms last August, awarding its AIP product higher scores than similar tools from Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and Databricks, a private company currently valued at $75 billion. The report highlighted differentiated software architecture as a key strength. ""Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market,"" wrote analyst Mike Gualtieri..Palantir continued to show near-flawless execution in the first quarter. Revenue increased 39% to $884 million, marking the seventh consecutive acceleration (as shown in the chart below), due to particularly strong growth in the U.S. commercial and government segments. And non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased 70% to $334 million. Management attributed the strong results to the demand for AIP..Importantly, Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar told analysts on the first-quarter earnings call, ""Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and in the years ahead."" That is encouraging because International Data Corporation estimates AI platform spending will increase by 40% annually through 2028.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-stock-turn-5-000-071400262.html," The risk involved is classified as **market risk** due to dependencies on unpredictable factors such as market conditions, competition, regulatory changes, economic fluctuations, legal challenges, and investor sentiment affecting Palantir's stock performance over the next decade."

The company has raised billions in funding from Microsoft, works closely with leading AI-focused cloud providers such as CoreWeave, and is among the key players pushing a $500 billion domestic AI infrastructure initiative called Project Stargate..Recently, OpenAI found itself in the headlines yet again following news of a major partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)..Let's explore how OpenAI and Alphabet are teaming up, and assess why this deal could be a game changer..Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital. As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure..While Azure's infrastructure has been key to OpenAI maintaining explosive growth over the last two years, recent moves from the ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft..For instance, as part of Project Stargate, Oracle is reportedly exploring purchasing several billion dollars worth of Nvidia's newest Blackwell GPU architecture and leasing access to these chips to OpenAI..According to recent reporting, OpenAI's partnership with Alphabet revolves around the same use case as the Oracle deal: accessing compute power through the Google Cloud Platform. As data workloads continue to rise, training and inferencing AI models becomes increasingly sophisticated and costly. Hence, broadening its cloud compute infrastructure beyond Azure is critical for OpenAI..While cloud computing has emerged as a fast-growing business for Alphabet, Google Cloud operates at a much smaller scale than Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). That said, working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business and AI efforts..However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-deal-alphabet-game-changer-220500302.html," The news about OpenAI partnering with Google's cloud platform presents a strategic collaboration that likely enhances their AI capabilities without immediate significant risks.

For these investors, NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR), Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG), and Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) look like smart choices to power their portfolios..Long gone are the days of massive nuclear power plants that require enormous capital investments and take years to construct. Nowadays, companies like NuScale Power are developing small modular reactors (SMRs) that offer a variety of advantages over conventional nuclear power plants..For one, SMRs require considerably smaller footprints, making them more attractive to project developers, which can scale these reactors to their individual site's needs. And SMRs have improved safety profiles including the ability to shut down and self-cool indefinitely, unlike traditional nuclear power plants. Among other advantages, NuScale's SMRs are built in a factory, which helps to keep costs down and expedite project development..With $491 million in cash and no debt, the company is on strong financial footing, an appealing situation for those looking to balance a quality growth stock that's not rife with risk. To state its competitive advantage over other SMR providers, NuScale Power says that it's the only near-term deployable SMR company with design approval from the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission..While Constellation Energy's portfolio includes about 10 gigawatts (GWs) of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets, it's nuclear energy that represents the lion's share of its generating capacity -- about 21 GWs, or enough power to meet the demands of 16 million homes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-profit-upcoming-nuclear-163300649.html," The article discusses potential investments in NuScale Power and Cameco within the nuclear energy sector, framing them as opportunities due to an anticipated nuclear power boom.

Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive.

The goal? Resilience, security, and control—values often missing from the current data ecosystem..When most investors hear the word “crypto,” they think price charts, digital assets, and decentralized finance. But according to Marta Belcher, President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation, that’s only scratching the surface..“Crypto isn’t just about finance,” Belcher said. “The real innovation is in programmable money.”.Filecoin is showing what that means—starting with decentralized file storage. At first glance, the network looks like a Web3 challenger to Amazon Web Services, allowing anyone in the world to rent out unused storage space and get paid in FIL tokens. But it’s the how that’s revolutionary: payments on Filecoin are automated, granular, and permissionless..“You can write a smart contract to pay a storage provider in real time, based on their uptime and performance,” said Belcher. “Or pay a songwriter a fraction of a cent for every second a song is streamed. These kinds of micro-transactions were never possible before crypto.”.It’s a bold reframe of what blockchain technology can do. Instead of speculative hype or abstract decentralization, Filecoin is highlighting a tangible use case: letting people earn, store, and interact with data and payments in programmable ways—no middlemen required..“Web3 lets us build systems where rules are baked into code,” Belcher added. “That opens up entirely new business models—ones where creators, consumers, and infrastructure providers are all directly connected.”.As regulators and investors continue to debate the future of digital assets, Filecoin is already shipping it. For Belcher and her team, the message is simple: crypto isn’t a bet on finance. It’s a bet on the programmable economy..Filecoin is building the 'Airbnb for file storage', says exec first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 20, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 20, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/filecoin-building-airbnb-file-storage-215818126.html," Based on the analysis of Filecoin's proposed 'Airbnb for file storage' initiative, several key risks emerge that could impact their business model:  1. **Competition from Established Players**: The company faces fierce competition from major cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud. Without a unique value proposition or superior service at a lower cost, gaining market share may be challenging.  2. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Emerging in the Web3 space, Filecoin may encounter varying regulations across different countries when expanding globally, potentially leading to legal challenges or delays.  3. **Market Adoption Challenges**: Success depends on factors such as pricing, ease of use, and user education. A small user base or inability to scale could hinder sustainability.  4. **Economic Fluctuations**: The global economy's health can influence consumer spending on cloud services; a downturn might reduce demand, while an upturn could intensify competition from established providers.  5. **Technological Risks**: Continuous innovation is crucial.

2025-06-19 04:03:00,This Nuclear Upstart Is Crushing the Market. Should You Plug In?,"Nuclear power is on the brink of a renaissance, and Oklo is one of the industry's emerging rock stars.","Oklo is developing next-gen microreactors that use recycled nuclear waste as fuel..Compelling catalysts and timely tailwinds have lifted the stock higher in recent months..Despite the hype, Oklo is a ""pre-revenue"" company trading at a sky-high valuation..10 stocks we like better than Oklo ›.If you're looking for a super-charged growth stock with an AI angle, there's a nuclear option to consider. I'm talking about Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), a next-generation nuclear power company on a mission to reboot atomic energy for the age of artificial intelligence..Established in 2013 by MIT alums Jacob DeWitte (now chief executive officer) and Caroline Cochran (now chief operating officer), Oklo went public in May 2024 via a merger with AltC Acquisition Corp., a SPAC led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Altman stepped down as Oklo's chairman in April..Oklo's mission is to develop compact, next-gen nuclear reactors that are efficient, ""walk-away safe,"" and capable of turning recycled nuclear waste into clean, reliable energy. The company's first commercial reactor is expected to come online in late 2027 or early 2028..Oklo's goal of reimagining nuclear power has certainly piqued Wall Street's imagination. Oklo's stock has rocketed 190% higher in 2025 as of the June 19 market close, and it's up 564% over the past year despite the company not yet having any revenue..Should you add this high-flying energy stock to your portfolio, or are you better off watching from the sidelines to see how the story unfolds? Let's dive in..Nuclear energy is having a moment. In May, President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders aimed at jump-starting domestic production of nuclear power, with the goal of quadrupling capacity by 2050. The orders emphasize the need for AI-ready power infrastructure, recycling of spent nuclear fuel, and faster licensing of advanced nuclear reactors, all of which play right into Oklo's hands..Oklo already has a site use permit from the Department of Energy to build its first microreactor at the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory, and an agreement with the Idaho National Laboratory to use recycled nuclear fuel as a uranium source. That means Oklo is poised to hit the ground running in a sector that's flush with political capital..Although Oklo is developing the type of advanced reactors that are named explicitly in Trump's executive orders, it's important to note that this isn't new technology.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuclear-upstart-crushing-market-plug-212900544.html," The article about Oklo suggests a positive outlook with nuclear power on a renaissance and Oklo as an emerging leader in this field. However, when considering the risk of investing, several factors come into play:  1. **Market Risk**: The broader market can fluctuate independently of Oklo's performance, adding inherent uncertainty.  2. **Sector-Specific Risks**: The nuclear power industry itself may face volatility due to regulatory changes or other sector-specific challenges that could impact Oklo's success.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in government policies on nuclear power could affect Oklo's market position and investment value.  4. **Technological Risks**: The novelty of Oklo's technology introduces the risk that its innovative approach may not deliver as expected, affecting its growth trajectory.  5. **Operational Risks**: Potential inefficiencies in energy production could impact profitability and thus the investment's success.  6. **Liquidity Issues**: If there is low trading activity or limited investor interest, selling shares without affecting the price becomes a challenge.  In conclusion, while Oklo presents an exciting opportunity due to its innovative approach and the resurgence of nuclear power, these risks highlight the need for careful consideration before investing."

Companies of all shapes and sizes are integrating into their daily workflows, and new industries are popping up because of it..The mass adoption of AI could result in a market size of more than $15 trillion by 2030, according to PwC research..Fortunately, there are tons of AI companies out there that actually have a foothold in the market and aren't just flash-in-the-pan opportunities. Here are two well-established companies that are already benefiting from this trend and could be great AI stocks for years to come..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) does exactly what its name describes -- it manufactures processors for companies. The world's leading chip designers, including Nvidia, rely on Taiwan Semiconductor (often referred to as TSMC) to make their processors because the company is so good at it..TSMC manufactures an estimated 90% of the world's artificial intelligence semiconductors, making it the clear leader in this market. This dominance led to TSMC's revenue rising 41% in the first quarter of 2025 to $25.5 billion and diluted earnings per share jumping 60% to $2.12 per American depository receipt (ADR)..TSMC relies on its technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing to stay ahead of its competitors, and so far, it's still leading the pack. The company is focused on its 5-nanometer (nm) and 3nm chip production and management said recently that there continues to be ""strong demand"" for both..The company's CEO, C.C. Wei, said early this year he expects TSMC's artificial intelligence revenue to double this year compared to last year and recently reiterated that forecast..Taiwan Semiconductor stock has already gained 142% over the past three years, so what makes the stock a buy right now? Demand for semiconductors hasn't slowed down yet, and no one knows when or if it will. Companies are locked in an AI race right now, and a big part of that involves getting their hands on the most advanced AI chips..With TSMC's dominance in semiconducting manufacturing and it already holding a lead in advanced AI processors, the company is poised to benefit from chip demand as long as tech giants need the best processors available. And despite its share price gains, TSMC stock has a price to earnings ratio of just 25, which is below the P/E multiple of the broader S&P 500.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-210000707.html," The news about AI stocks primarily highlights growth potential and positive developments without explicitly outlining specific risks.

After hitting a low in early April, Wall Street staged a strong rebound fueled by renewed optimism over trade negotiations, solid corporate earnings, easing inflation and continued momentum in artificial intelligence.Technology stocks led the charge, with the Magnificent Seven making a powerful comeback after months of turbulence.As the half-year mark approaches, the S&P 500 is now less than 3% below its record high, while the Nasdaq Composite is 3.4% off its all-time peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, remains only marginally positive for the year. Volatility is expected to persist in the second half.Let’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:.On April 2, Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs dubbed “Liberation Day” tariffs. These included a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imports, with a few exceptions such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber. On top of the baseline, Trump introduced “reciprocal” tariffs that targeted specific countries. China faced tariffs ranging from 34% to 54%, the European Union 20%, Japan 24% and Vietnam up to 46%. These tariffs officially took effect on April 9.Facing backlash and international criticism, the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for over 75 countries on May 12, though the 10% baseline tariff remained in place. Additionally, Chinese tariffs were reduced from a peak of 145% to around 30%, though they remained substantially elevated. On May 30, Trump doubled tariffs on imported steel, raising them from 25% to 50%, citing national security concerns and the need to protect U.S. industry.These actions faced legal scrutiny. On May 28, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that many of the tariffs were illegal under international trade law. However, the court also issued a stay, meaning the tariffs would remain in place pending appeals.These tariff policies triggered an initial market rout, with trillions lost in just days. However, the partial pause in tariffs and the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady led to a strong rebound. Some sectors emerged as clear winners. Companies like Palantir Technologies PLTR surged more than 90% since the April sell-off and recently hit a new all-time high. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 60 days for this year and has an estimated growth of 41.46%.

According to a report in The Wall Street Journal last week, OpenAI is now even considering a “nuclear option” to sever ties for good..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.At the heart of the matter is how large a stake Microsoft will own in OpenAI’s public benefit corporation, a subsidiary of the ChatGPT maker that will still be controlled by the nonprofit parent. According to a recent Reuters report, OpenAI wants the Big Tech player to hold a 33% stake while relinquishing its rights to future profits. Microsoft hasn’t agreed, and the two sides are at loggerheads over the matter, though it’s far from their first fight..Microsoft already loosened its grip on the AI firm in January, allowing some key terms of their agreement to change so that OpenAI could tap data centers outside of the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. That resulted in “Stargate,” a high-profile $500 million data center joint venture between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle (with Microsoft, Nvidia, and Arm serving as “technology partners”). But opening the door to more independence may be objectionable to Microsoft: Earlier this month, Reuters reported OpenAI is now planning to tap Google’s cloud services to meet its growing need for computing capacity. In another line-crossing move, The Information reported last week that OpenAI has been offering a suite of ChatGPT enterprise tools at discounts of up to 20%, directly undercutting sales of competing Microsoft services like Copilot..In other words, tensions are at an all-time high, and now both sides are throwing around fighting words at a time when level-headed communication is crucial:.According to the WSJ, OpenAI executives have discussed a “nuclear option” of formally accusing Microsoft of antitrust violations if it can’t come to an agreement with the Windows-maker over transition terms..According to a Financial Times report published Wednesday, Microsoft is prepared to walk away from negotiations altogether and simply ride out its existing commercial contract with OpenAI, which is set to last until 2030. That would leave OpenAI stuck with its current structure, which means it’d lose out on half of the $40 billion investment SoftBank committed to making in April, which was contingent on a successful restructuring to for-profit by the end of the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-careens-toward-messy-divorce-103000468.html," The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI is on the rocks due to a messy divorce. The primary concern here is reputational risk. Such a high-profile breakup could undermine investor confidence, particularly if the public becomes aware of the reasons behind the separation. This might affect OpenAI's ability to secure future funding or partnerships, potentially slowing down its growth. Additionally, Microsoft may face backlash from its investors and the tech community for its strategic decisions. However, there could also be an opportunity for OpenAI to pivot into new markets or technologies, which might be a secondary benefit rather than a direct risk.  **Conclusion:** The primary risk is reputational damage affecting investor confidence, while opportunities include potential expansion in new areas post-divorce."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap by 2028,Nvidia management is excited about the company's long-term growth potential.  Data center-related capital expenditures could reach $1 trillion annually by 2028.  The closest companies to reaching that milestone are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).,"Nvidia management is excited about the company's long-term growth potential..Data center-related capital expenditures could reach $1 trillion annually by 2028..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.There has never been a $5 trillion company. The closest companies to reaching that milestone are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Both companies have market capitalizations of around $3.5 trillion. Using their current growth trajectories as a guide, they could reach that $5 trillion mark in a few years. But which one will get there first?.The signs point to Nvidia, based on its impressive growth and the increasing market for its products. Although Nvidia has made investors a boatload of money over the past few years, there's still plenty ahead, making it an attractive stock to own right now..Here's why Nvidia has the potential to be the first $5 trillion company by 2028..Nvidia's rise goes hand-in-hand with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of data centers that help process AI computations. AI hyperscalers (large-scale cloud service providers that offer massive computing resources, storage, and networking infrastructure) like Microsoft are racing to install as much equipment as possible to run AI workloads. That way, they can profit from the various companies running AI on their servers by charging usage fees..While multiple companies are pursuing this approach, Nvidia is the main supplier of the graphics processing units (GPUs) central to their operation. And while there are alternatives to Nvidia's products, it has a 90% or greater share in the data center GPU market, similar to Alphabet's dominance in the search engine industry (through Google). This helps put Nvidia's dominance into perspective. Even better, the demand for data centers is growing far quicker than the growth in Search..Nearly every AI hyperscaler has announced record data center capital expenditures in 2025. Planning, developing, and constructing the sites on which these centers are built takes years, so this heightened spending will persist for multiple years. A third-party estimate Nvidia cited during its 2025 GTC event said global data center spending was $400 billion in 2024, but it is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028..For reference, during FY 2025 (which encompasses most of 2024), Nvidia's data center division delivered $115 billion in revenue. So, for every $100 spent on data centers, about $29 went to Nvidia..What will this mean for Nvidia in the future?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-090000525.html," The analysis of the article indicates that the primary risk associated with NVIDIA's potential stock price reaching $5 trillion by 2028 is tied to the high expectations and assumptions behind the projection. While the article highlights significant growth potential due to data center investments, it also acknowledges the presence of a key competitor, Microsoft. The risks include:  1. **Competition**: While NVIDIA is strong in AI hardware, the competition from established players like Microsoft could impact its market share. 2. **Market Saturation and Growth Rate**: If the $5 trillion target is not met due to market saturation or slower-than-expected growth rates, it could affect NVIDIA's valuation. 3. **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in government policies affecting AI and data centers could pose risks. 4. **Technological Disruption**: Ongoing technological advancements might render current products obsolete.  Thus, the article presents a scenario with significant risk, emphasizing the need for NVIDIA to deliver on its growth promise."

2025-06-19 04:03:00,OPINION: Why “least privilege” is Canada’s best defence,Microsoft vulnerabilities are rising — and the best defense for Canadian companies may be limiting who can access what and why," Microsoft just hit a record high of 1,360 reported vulnerabilities in its software last year. While that number might sound scary, it’s part of a trend we’ve seen for years. The real problem lies in what’s behind the numbers and what they mean for Canadian businesses trying to stay secure in a fast-moving world.    As BeyondTrust’s latest Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report reveals, one type of security risk is especially alarming: elevation of privilege (EoP). This category made up 40 per cent of Microsoft’s total reported vulnerabilities in 2024. That’s not just a statistic; it’s a wake-up call.   .What’s elevation of privilege and why should Canadians care?    Imagine someone finds a way to break into your office using a stolen key card. That’s what an elevation of privilege attack is like in the digital world. Once inside, hackers can quietly move through your systems, taking control of sensitive data or expanding their access without being noticed.    These attacks often begin with compromised credentials, sometimes even from non-human identities like service accounts. The problem snowballs from there. We’ve seen it over and over in major data breaches: attackers find one weak point, then jump from system to system.    And Microsoft isn’t the only target. If 40 per cent of their vulnerabilities are EoP-related, imagine how many other software platforms that Canadian companies rely on could also be vulnerable.    The rise of security feature bypass attacks  .Another disturbing trend is the spike in security feature bypass vulnerabilities, up 60 per cent since 2020. These are loopholes hackers use to get around built-in protections in tools like Microsoft Office and Windows.    Think of these bypasses as digital “unlocked doors.” If an attacker finds one, it doesn’t matter how strong your locks are, they’re walking right in. Tools like EDR (endpoint detection and response) are meant to stop threats, but attackers are finding ways around them too. We’ve seen the rise of tools like EDR Killer that are designed specifically to sneak past these defences.    Why Canadian companies can’t rely on just one layer of security  .Some businesses still make the mistake of thinking one product or platform will keep them safe. But cybersecurity isn’t about one silver bullet. It’s about layered defences, also known as “defence in depth.”    For example, if a patch causes problems or breaks other tools, companies might delay applying it. But that delay gives attackers a window of opportunity. The better approach? Have multiple layers of protection in place, especially for front-line systems and high-risk assets.    Microsoft Edge: The new problem child?  ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opinion-why-least-privilege-canada-000051479.html," The risk type associated with the news article is **cybersecurity risk**, specifically related to IT security practices, particularly focusing on access control mechanisms like ""least privilege."" This risk arises from the balance organizations must strike between mitigating known vulnerabilities in systems like Microsoft software through controlled access and managing the potential complexities and misconfigurations that could inadvertently expose more sensitive information."

Bloomberg reports OpenAI is now looking to block Microsoft from accessing IP tied to its $3 billion Windsurf acquisition. Meanwhile, the Financial Times says Microsoft floated giving up equity in exchange for future tech accessunderscoring how high the stakes are for both sides. Despite public assurances of a long-term partnership, Microsoft insiders have signaled they're prepared to walk if talks break down..Adding pressure is OpenAI's nonprofit structure, which requires any asset transfer to be priced at fair market valueno shortcuts.

The drop reflects modest revenue growth prospects in the near term, as the company continues to face stiff competition in the AI and generative AI (GenAI) space from the likes of Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI, as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions.Adobe’s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business. Alphabet’s focus on leveraging AI to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search, Google Cloud and Pixel. Adobe is also facing stiff competition from DocuSign DOCU in the document services & e-signature domain.However, second-quarter fiscal 2025 results indicated that Adobe is catching up through the expansion of its AI portfolio with GenStudio and Firefly Services. Adobe’s AI book of business from AI-first products, including Acrobat AI assistant, Firefly App and Services and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, is tracking ahead of the $250 million ending Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) target by the end of fiscal 2025.

It has jumped an impressive 61% since then. But will this semiconductor giant be able to sustain its momentum in the long run and deliver solid gains to investors over the next five years?.AMD's recent quarterly reports make it clear that the chipmaker's business is moving in the right direction. Its revenue in the first quarter of 2025 increased an impressive 36% year over year, while its guidance for the current quarter points toward another nice year-over-year increase of 27%..The chipamker's data center and client processor businesses are driving the bulk of this growth. The company's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) are in healthy demand from cloud computing customers who are deploying them in artificial intelligence (AI) servers for model training and inference. This explains the 57% year-over-year increase in AMD's data center revenue in Q1..Importantly, AMD sees a massive increase in its addressable opportunity in the data center segment over the next few years. At its recently held Advancing AI investor event, AMD pointed out that the data center AI accelerator market is on track to clock an annual growth rate of more than 60% through 2028, generating more than $500 billion in revenue by 2028..There is no doubt that Nvidia is the dominant company in this market with a share of 92%, but AMD is trying to catch up thanks to its product development moves. The chipmaker has just unveiled its MI350 series of data center GPUs, claiming that it packs 4 times more computing power than the previous generation offering, apart from achieving a 35-fold increase in AI inferencing..Analysts estimate that the new MI350 family of processors will help AMD close the gap with Nvidia's Blackwell offerings.

2025-06-19 04:03:00,Will the AI-Infrastructure Boom Lift C3.ai's Application Demand?,AI's 25% revenue growth and rising partner-driven deals show traction as enterprises seek turnkey AI solutions.,"C3.ai, Inc. AI finds itself at a pivotal moment as the broader AI-infrastructure boom gains traction across the enterprise landscape. While hyperscalers like Microsoft, AWS and Google build the foundation, C3.ai is focused on delivering turnkey AI applications that solve practical business problems, from predictive maintenance to fraud detection.With over 130 AI applications deployed and more than 600 joint account efforts underway with Microsoft alone, C3.ai is counting on the infrastructure boom to fuel downstream demand for its software. In fiscal 2025, C3.ai posted 25% year-over-year revenue growth, bolstered by deepening partnerships and strong adoption across sectors like manufacturing, defense and life sciences.A key enabler is its expanding partner ecosystem. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, 73% of bookings came through partners, with a 419% year-over-year surge in partner-supported deals. Investments in demo licenses and prioritized engineering services, together accounting for nearly overall revenues, are helping partners showcase C3.ai’s solutions effectively.While the broader infrastructure buildout continues to attract headlines and capital, C3.ai’s thesis is that enterprise value accrues not at the hardware or model level, but where actionable AI is deployed. As enterprises seek production-ready solutions atop robust infrastructure, C3.ai’s differentiated platform could see a long-awaited lift.Still, we believe unlocking this potential depends on C3.ai’s ability to consistently execute, accelerate deal conversions and drive deeper adoption of its applications. If the company delivers on these fronts, the AI infrastructure boom will not just boost data processing, it could be the catalyst that propels C3.ai into the next phase of meaningful top-line growth..While C3.ai takes the position of a pioneer in turnkey enterprise AI applications, it is not alone in targeting the growing demand built atop AI infrastructure. Two noteworthy competitors are Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR and Snowflake Inc. SNOW.Palantir, long known for government analytics contracts, has made a decisive shift into commercial AI with its Artificial Intelligence Platform. Like C3.ai, Palantir focuses on real-world use cases, particularly in manufacturing, logistics and defense. It also benefits from early mover advantage and deep client relationships in sensitive, high-barrier sectors.Snowflake, though rooted in cloud data warehousing, is evolving toward a full AI-data platform. Its acquisition of AI startups and rollout of Snowflake Cortex shows a pivot to infuse AI natively into enterprise workflows. While not a pure-play application provider, Snowflake’s tight integration with cloud infrastructure and data pipelines positions it as a formidable challenger.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-infrastructure-boom-lift-c3-135600996.html," Based on the analysis of the provided information, here is a structured breakdown of the risks C3.ai might be facing:  1. **Market Competition**: The expansion of the AI infrastructure boom could lead to increased competition among companies offering turnkey AI solutions. This might result inC3.ai's market share being impacted.  2. **Technological Obsolescence**: Rapid advancements in AI technology could render existing infrastructure outdated, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies or challenges in maintaining a competitive edge.  3. **Sector-Specific Dependency**: The company's reliance on enterprises seeking turnkey solutions might be too dependent on specific industries or project types. This could create vulnerabilities if those sectors face unexpected issues.  4. **Operational Scaling Challenges**: The company may face difficulties in scaling its operations efficiently, which could result in increased costs without corresponding increases in revenue growth.  In summary, while C3.ai is experiencing positive developments such as revenue growth and partner deals, potential risks include increased competition, technological risk, sector-specific dependency, and operational challenges from scaling."
2025-06-19 04:03:00,A $20 billion clock is ticking for OpenAI as Microsoft talks turn fractious,The romance between Microsoft and OpenAI is reportedly showing cracks.,"OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) is racing against time to restructure its business — a must for the company if it hopes to hang on to a part of a multibillion-dollar investment led by SoftBank and gain more control over how it deploys its revenue..The plans call for OpenAI to transform its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation overseen by its nonprofit parent. If the company fails to reach a deal by year’s end, it could kiss half of the $40 billion in funding goodbye. But OpenAI’s biggest impediment reportedly comes from its closest investing partner: Microsoft (MSFT)..The cloud computing giant invested $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023, following earlier outlays in 2019 and 2021. The investment gives Microsoft a major equity stake in OpenAI’s for-profit operations, along with exclusive access to OpenAI’s application programming interfaces (APIs) and models on Azure, revenue-sharing arrangements, and access to OpenAI’s intellectual property until 2030..The team-up has been a boon for Microsoft, which has benefited from being able to sell OpenAI’s technologies to its customers. In the company’s fiscal 2024, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its AI cloud services, generated $105 billion of the company’s $245 billion in total revenue..But as OpenAI seeks to restructure its business, it’s also looking to break free from some of what it sees as the more onerous terms of the Microsoft deal. Now, the two companies are at loggerheads over the terms of a new deal. And unfortunately for OpenAI, it can’t move forward with its for-profit plans without buy-in from Microsoft..The Wall Street Journal reported this week that negotiations between the two companies over a new for-profit structure have become contentious enough for OpenAI to consider asking antitrust regulators to get involved to find potential competition impediments in its agreement with Microsoft..And on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that Microsoft is willing to walk away from discussions entirely..“We have a long-term, productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone. Talks are ongoing and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” Microsoft and OpenAI said in a joint statement..OpenAI isn’t just looking to change the terms of its existing agreements. According to Bloomberg, the company is also looking to block Microsoft from accessing technology from its $3 billion acquisition of AI coding tool Windsurf..Another major issue is how much equity Microsoft would have in OpenAI’s restructured business. The Financial Times reported that the tech giant had offered to give up equity in exchange for access to future technology.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-20-billion-clock-is-ticking-for-openai-as-microsoft-talks-turn-fractious-130006071.html," The news article suggests a potential breakup between Microsoft and OpenAI, indicating underlying tensions. This situation presents several risks:  1. **Loss of Collaboration**: If the partnership falters, Microsoft may lose access to OpenAI's AI technologies, potentially delaying advancements in AI and causing competitive disadvantage.  2. **Coevolution Risk**: Microsoft might adopt or neglect AI technology depending on the breakup's outcome, affecting their market position in the tech industry.  3. **Regulatory and Legal Risks**: The collaboration could lead to regulatory scrutiny, including antitrust issues or data privacy concerns as both companies handle sensitive information.  4. **Market Volatility**: Investor concerns over Microsoft's AI strategy could cause stock price fluctuations due to uncertainty about future technology developments.  5. **Ethical Considerations**: A loss of control over AI development might raise ethical questions regarding innovation and investment in other technological areas.  In conclusion, while there's no direct risk mentioned, the potential outcomes involve significant risks related to technological collaboration, regulatory compliance, market shifts, and investor sentiment."

The magic comes from the nature of quantum physics. While traditional computers operate on bits that can be in only one of two states, a quantum qubit is probabilistic, occupying some combination of those two states. This property opens the door to exponentially faster computations..Today's quantum computers generally aren't capable of solving real-world problems quicker than traditional computers. They are capable of performing some types of computations faster, but these computations are more toy problems than anything else. When Alphabet's Google unveiled its Willow quantum chip last year, it claimed that Willow could perform a particular benchmark in five minutes that would take a supercomputer 10 septillion years. Unfortunately, that benchmark has no known real-world applications..Another problem is error correction. Qubits are fragile, and errors are inevitably introduced over the course of a computation. Those errors must be prevented, corrected, or otherwise mitigated for long enough for a computation to be completed..Microsoft made some noise on this front earlier this year with its Majorana 1 quantum chip, which uses exotic particles to create more robust qubits. However, the company is in the early stages of scaling this technology, and it could very well be many years before anything useful comes out of it..International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), a quantum computing pioneer, now sees a path to full-scale quantum error correction by 2029 and true quantum advantage by the end of 2026. The company has a clear roadmap, and if it can deliver, quantum computing could turn into a major business for the century-old tech giant..IBM is taking a modular approach on its path to the holy grail of quantum computing. This year, IBM will release Nighthawk, its new quantum process with 120 qubits and 5,000 quantum gates. Over the next few years, successive versions of Nighthawk will increase the number of gates, culminating in 2028 with a 15,000-gate version that can be linked together in groups of nine. IBM believes Nighthawk will be able to achieve true quantum advantage.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ibm-best-quantum-computing-112000391.html," The primary risk associated with IBM being considered one of the best quantum computing stocks to buy right now is Technological Risks. These risks stem from the challenges inherent in advancing quantum computing technology, including overcoming significant technological hurdles such as qubit maintenance, error correction, scaling systems, and ensuring security. Additionally, factors like R&D success, regulatory compliance, market integration timing, supply chain vulnerabilities, and competition also contribute to potential risks that IBM must navigate effectively."

What's unique, however, is that the usual suspects of Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon aren't really pegged to the rising interest in quantum computing technology..Rather, a new cohort of rising stars such as Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) are among the most popular quantum computing stocks right now. With shares down by 25% from their peak over the last year, IonQ stock trades for roughly $40 as of this writing. Is now a good opportunity to pounce on the stock?.Quantum computing is not a widely used application in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Yet despite its developmental stage, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that quantum computing could be a $131 billion opportunity in the coming decades. With the potential for such enormous upside, it's not entirely surprising that investors were quick to look at which companies are involved with quantum computing development..One reason that I think IonQ has emerged as a favorite in the quantum computing market is the company's impressive partnerships with cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. With the stock sliding as of late, investors may be wondering if the sell-off is an opportunity to buy the dip..Despite working with major AI developers, IonQ has little to show in terms of tangible growth. Over the last year, the company has only generated $43 million in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's net losses are in the hundreds of millions (and worsening)..In a way, this financial profile actually makes some sense. As I alluded to above, quantum computing is not yet commercially used in AI development. Given those dynamics, IonQ's revenue potential is fairly limited for the time being. The unfortunate reality is that the company will likely remain a high-cash-burn operation as it continues building out its platform..But still, for just $40 could IonQ be worth a look? Well, smart investors understand that the stock price alone does not determine the worth of a business. As of this writing, IonQ boasts a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. This implies that IonQ is trading for a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 195.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-25-now-time-pounce-110000459.html," The analysis of the article regarding IonQ's stock involves identifying the type of risk associated with the investment opportunity presented. Here's a structured breakdown:  1. **Market Context**: IonQ operates in the quantum computing sector, which is inherently innovative and faces challenges such as qubit maintenance and error rates. This field is highly competitive and uncertain, adding inherent market risk.  2. **Stock Performance**: The article mentions a 25% drop inIonQ's stock price. While this indicates potential undervaluation, it also reflects market sentiment influenced by hype or lack of execution, introducing speculative elements typical of investment decisions.  3. **Speculative Investing**: The decision to buy at $40 involves speculative risk due to the high potential for return but also significant risks of loss if factors like company performance, competition, and execution plans do not meet expectations.  4. **Execution Risk**: IonQ's roadmap, including partnerships and technology development, is a critical factor. If these are underdeveloped or delayed, it poses another layer of risk beyond market volatility.  5. **Systematic Risk**: The broader market's reaction to the news contributes to systematic risk, affecting all stocks and introducing uncertainty in investment returns.  **Conclusion**: The risk involved is speculative, with potential for high returns offset by significant risks such as competition, execution challenges, and market sentiment volatility. Investors should consider these factors alongside their risk tolerance and investment strategy."

The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pushing for a 10-year nationwide ban that would block U.S. states from regulating artificial intelligence. The proposal, already tucked into the House version of Trump's budget bill, is being sold as a way to avoid a messy patchwork of state-level rules that could slow innovation and leave the U.S. trailing China. Their message: keep regulation federal, uniform, and minimalfor now. The lobbying effort is backed by INCOMPAS, a trade group representing tech heavyweights, which launched the AI Competition Center this year to drive home that point. Chip Pickering, INCOMPAS CEO, said the move is about safeguarding America's lead in AI..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN..But not everyone's buying that narrative. Criticsincluding academics, policy analysts, and even some in Silicon Valleyargue this could be less about innovation and more about locking in dominance. MIT's Max Tegmark called it a power grab, while voices from the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator warned that defanging state oversight now could make AI's societal risks harder to manage later.

This time, however, it wasn't because the ChatGPT developer released another groundbreaking product aimed at its rivals..Rather, investors learned that OpenAI is teaming up with ... Alphabet. Below, I'm going to detail why the partnership between OpenAI and Alphabet is such a big deal..Moreover, I'll break down which AI data center stock I think is poised to benefit most from this deal. Let's dig in..You may recall that when OpenAI emerged a few years ago, Microsoft was fast to partner with the company. More specifically, Microsoft plowed $10 billion into OpenAI as part of a strategic investment. One of the cornerstones of this deal was integrating ChatGPT into Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure. Throughout their partnership, OpenAI's compute infrastructure for training and inferencing was primarily supported by Microsoft. With Google entering the picture, however, those dynamics have changed..OpenAI is branching out beyond Microsoft and now leveraging the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to complement Azure for compute resources. While this is a huge win for Alphabet's cloud business -- which rivals both Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- I see an even bigger winner emerging from this partnership..While Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have been critical sources of high-performance chipsets for data centers throughout the AI revolution, a new player is emerging as a key resource in the space..CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) provides critical infrastructure services to AI developers through a cloud-based model. Companies that may not have the time or financial resources to acquire graphics processing units (GPU) from Nvidia and its peers can essentially rent them from CoreWeave's cloud-based infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monster-artificial-intelligence-ai-data-010000853.html," The analysis of Google Cloud's partnership with OpenAI reveals several key risks:  1. **Market Competition**: The deal may trigger further competition in AI technology, potentially leading to price decreases for consumers or increased innovation across the industry.  2. **Regulatory Challenges**: Regulatory scrutiny on AI could affect how companies operate, including changes in product development and deployment practices.  3. **Supply Chain Risks**: If the partnership doesn't involve major components like Nvidia's GPUs, there might be unexpected supply chain issues affecting costs and availability.  4. **Cybersecurity Concerns**: The integration of advanced AI models poses risks related to data security management, including potential misuse or breaches.  In summary, while this partnership opens new avenues for innovation, it also introduces significant risks that could impact the market landscape and operational efficiency across various sectors involved."

On the surface, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence..However, over the last couple of weeks, Tesla stock has started to witness some new life -- save for a brief sell-off following a fleeting tiff between Elon Musk and President Trump..While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback during the second half of the year..Let's explore a major update coming to Tesla soon and understand how this could fuel shares to new all-time highs. Is now the time to pounce on Tesla stock? Read on to find out..Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs. Rather, Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla..Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software. Tesla plans to leverage self-driving software across two applications: offering it as a feature in its cars and building a fleet of robotaxis for ride-hailing services..While the initial launch date for the Tesla Robotaxi was rumored to be June 12, more recent commentary from Musk himself suggests that the first rides will take place in Austin, Texas, later this month (potentially between June 22 and 28)..A successful robotaxi launch represents a transformative shift in Tesla -- from primarily a car manufacturer to more of an AI-powered services provider disrupting ride-hailing, car rentals, or logistics businesses..When it comes to popular stocks in the AI realm, I'm sure cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon come to mind. Moreover, given Nvidia's ongoing rollout of its new Blackwell GPU architecture, the semiconductor king appears well positioned for further growth, too..Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AI capital expenditures (capex) just this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-220000899.html," The news article reflects a **moderate risk** due to the following potential risks:  1. **Market Sentiment**: Investors may shift their focus away from AI to more established or rapidly growing sectors like cloud computing or semiconductors, leading to decreased interest and price pressure on the AI stock.  2. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: The stock could face supply chain disruptions or oversupply if new companies enter the market without a clear competitive edge in AI capabilities.  3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Increased regulatory attention and oversight of AI technologies could lead to higher costs, slower adoption, or even market restrictions for the company.  4. **Competition from Established Players**: Major tech firms with significant investments in AI may outperform this stock if they achieve faster monetization or broader market penetration.  5. **Technological Readiness**: The time-to-market for AI applications and solutions could delay their full commercial impact, affecting growth prospects.  6. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Unforeseen disruptions in the production of AI-related hardware or software could lead to delays, cost increases, and lower margins.  7. **Overall Market Sentiment**: Volatility in the broader market and investor sentiment toward high-risk, high-reward investments like AI could impact the stock's performance.  While there is a potential for significant upside, these risks highlight the need for careful consideration and diversification in such investments."

The Wall Street Journal reports that the ChatGPT maker has considered pushing for an antitrust case against its partner, while the Financial Times reports that Microsoft is ready to walk away from the deal..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Microsoft is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs as part of the company's latest move to trim its workforce. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here with more on the story. So what are these cuts all about? And they come on the heels of cuts that the company's already been doing, right? .Yeah, thousands of jobs, uh this is according to a Bloomberg report, are kind of up in the air at this point. Microsoft could start to announce the layoffs at the end of its fiscal year, which is coming up. Uh and yet, this comes after they left uh laid off thousands of workers uh earlier in in May. So it it's kind of a a recurring thing for Microsoft at this point where they continue to lay off uh workers every few months. They they say that it's part of uh their kind of right sizing, I guess, is the corporate parlance, uh or, you know, a means of making sure that they can be as dynamic as possible. Uh it it really, I think, comes down to making sure that uh they have uh the people that they want in the right places at the biggest positions of the company, which are at this point, AI and cloud. Uh and so, you know, don't forget they're also spending billions of dollars on their infrastructure build out on the cloud. So I think that's where a lot of uh of this is coming from. But you know, Microsoft isn't the only company that has gone through this where they've laid off workers, uh as a result of, as they see inefficiencies, or things along those lines. Uh Google had big layoffs. Meta had big layoffs. Uh and so, you know, it it seems to be uh this this kind of continuation of those layoffs going forward. .Dan, while you're here, I want your take on another tech headline. What did you make of Sam Altman saying Meta was offering open AI staff I read this twice because I thought I misread this was $100 million bonuses. .Look man, I'd lie. I would lie and be like, ""Yeah, I work there. I I know I know Sam."" Uh yeah, I mean, this is basically just, you know, their way of trying to catch up, right? Uh they're disappointed with the way that La 4 hasn't really lived up to their own expectations. They've had to push that back, that release back. Uh they have Scale AI now. Or they're you know, they they've put in was it $14.3 billion to get Scale AI. Uh this is a race to see who can get the most talent, the best talent, and beat the the kind of behemoth that is OpenAI still at this point, right? Now, that's not to say that, you know, other companies aren't aren't doing the same thing, or, you know, trying to poach people. $100 million is pretty rich. Um but you know, uh I do .Well and and I don't know that we need to take him literally about one hundred He was saying this in a podcast, right? Even if it's a million dollars, even if it's $5 million, like the point is .I'd still take it. .The point is, is that the war for AI talent has become and and the irony of course, is that AI's going to replace a lot of jobs, but at the same time that it's creating this huge war for talent. I mean, then on the flip side you got the FT now reporting that Microsoft is talking about halting talks with OpenAI, if they can't come together on issues. Now maybe they're just putting out there that out there in order to put pressure on OpenAI. But again, it speaks to this sort of competitive competitiveness around all of these issues, right? .Yeah. And and look, this this report comes out after a prior Wall Street Journal report saying that Microsoft, or OpenAI was willing to uh go the antitrust route, and make an antitrust complaint about Microsoft. So this is a back and forth, uh no love lost between uh the two at the moment. We reached out to Microsoft and OpenAI and we got a statement for Microsoft saying, you know, basically everything's hunky-dory there. You know, they're working together, uh you know, and they they like their relationship. Um but this this idea that Microsoft would be prepared to walk away, I mean, that's just the the the the talks right now, not away from OpenAI.
