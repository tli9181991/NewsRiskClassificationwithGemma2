Remember, the movie by the same name doesn't have the happiest of endings, and the tragedy made sense as a metaphor for potential market bubbles. Still, the Magnificent Seven group keeps setting the tone for the overall stock market, and most of these stocks are market darlings in 2025, with double-digit price gains over the last 52 weeks..But Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is lagging behind with a 2% price dip over the last year, and the stock looks downright undervalued in many ways. It's the only Magnificent Seven stock I have bought this year, for one simple reason: It's the best combination of affordable shares and unbeatable artificial intelligence (AI) expertise in this elite group..The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running circles around Google Cloud..But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices. Nvidia stock trades at 47 times earnings and 49 times free cash flows today. Microsoft and Amazon have P/E ratios in the mid-30s and cash flow multiples well above Nvidia's. At the same time, Alphabet stock looks affordable at 19 times earnings and 28 times free cash flows..The numbers never tell the whole story, and there's more to say about Alphabet's long-term growth opportunities. From AI services to quantum computing systems, the company was built to thrive amid ever-changing markets and unexpected economy jolts. But the modest stock valuation is a great starting point for further research..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buy-only-1-magnificent-115100143.html," The investment decision of buying only one ""Magnificent 7"" stock, specifically Alphabet, involves several key risks:  1. **Market Risk**: The tech sector can be highly volatile, with broader market trends significantly affecting individual stocks.  2. **Concentration Risk**: Investing in just one company out of seven major tech firms exposes the portfolio to significant risk if that company underperforms.  3. **Competitive Landscape**: Alphabet might face intense competition from its peers and could struggle without strategic differentiation or innovation.  4. **Strategic Initiatives**: The need for Alphabet to implement effective strategies (e.g., AI, renewable energy) may be crucial to reversing its decline; failure here could lead to further declines.  5. **Valuation Concerns**: If the stock is undervalued due to perceived issues without corresponding fundamental changes, it might continue to fall.  6. **Diversification Risk**: Reliance on a single company within a large, diversified group like the ""Magnificent 7"" can result in unexpected losses if that specific company underperforms.  In conclusion, while Alphabet's lag could present an opportunity, potential risks include market volatility, competitive pressures, strategic challenges, and diversification issues. Investors should consider these factors carefully before making their decision."

In conclusion, while the partnership offers promising benefits, these risks suggest that investors should carefully assess the potential downsides before making decisions."
2025-06-21 19:00:00,"Nvidia Stock Prediction, From Someone Who Has Invested for Decades","The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia.  As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit.  In the span of only a few years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the largest stocks in the world.","The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia..As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.In the span of only a few years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the largest stocks in the world. Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chips fall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-prediction-someone-invested-110000215.html," The type of risk involved in this article about Nvidia's stock prediction is **market risk**.

That should continue as its CUDA software program has created a wide moat, helping it attain a 92% market share in the GPU space in the first quarter. With AI infrastructure demand continuing to rise, Nvidia is well-positioned for years of continued growth..Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending..While Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips. It projects that its three furthest along customers in this area will be a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity in fiscal 2027 alone. Meanwhile, it has added other big customers since then, including Apple. Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, producing chips for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. Its technological expertise and scale have made it an invaluable part of the semiconductor value chain, allowing it to increase prices and expand margins. As AI infrastructure spending and other chip consumption grows, TSMC is set to be one of the biggest winners in the years ahead..Biggest risks: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending and/or Intel being a more viable competitor..Originally a data-gathering and analytics company serving the U.S government, Palantir Technologies' (NASDAQ: PLTR) AI platform (AIP) has been gaining strong momentum in the U.S. commercial sector. The platform helps organizations gather data from a variety of sources and organize it into an ""ontology"" that connects the data to real-world assets and processes. This allows its customers to then use AI to solve complex, real-world problems. AIP is being used in a wide array of industries, which gives Palantir a huge growth runway ahead.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-monster-stocks-hold-next-102000846.html," The news about monster stocks highlights significant growth opportunities across multiple sectors. While the potential for high returns is attractive, it's essential to recognize the associated risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The tech sector, particularly smaller companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, can be highly volatile. Market fluctuations or shifts in investor sentiment can impact their performance.  2. **Economic Cycles**: Tech companies may underperform during economic downturns when consumer spending decreases, affecting businesses reliant on technology-driven solutions.  3. **Sector-Specific Risks**: Companies in the consumer goods sector, while stable, might be more vulnerable to broader macroeconomic changes such as inflation or shifts in consumer preferences.  In summary, while the article identifies promising growth areas, investors should consider the inherent risks associated with market volatility, economic cycles, and sector-specific vulnerabilities. Diversification across sectors could mitigate some of these risks."

The AI strategy is still in flux, though, as new CEO Lip-Bu Tan revamps the company.  Meanwhile, AMD is set to roll out its new Helios rack-scale AI solution next year, likely beating Intel to market.","Intel has largely given up on selling AI accelerators directly and is focusing on rack-scale solutions..The AI strategy is still in flux, though, as new CEO Lip-Bu Tan revamps the company..Meanwhile, AMD is set to roll out its new Helios rack-scale AI solution next year, likely beating Intel to market..10 stocks we like better than Intel ›.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) made a run at the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market with its Gaudi line of chips, which came with the company's $2 billion acquisition of Habana. Unlike the graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Gaudi featured a different type of architecture that excelled in certain workloads. While Gaudi 3 wasn't up to par with Nvidia's leading AI accelerators when it launched, Intel offered attractive pricing as a way to lure customers..While Gaudi 3 won some high-profile customers, namely IBM for its watsonx platform, the chip was mostly a bust. Intel set a $500 million AI accelerator sales target for 2024, already a fraction of what Nvidia and AMD sell annually, and failed to meet it. While Gaudi's pricing was attractive, an immature software ecosystem, an unfamiliar architecture, and a complicated roadmap from Intel conspired to keep customers away..Intel later abandoned Falcon Shores, which was expected to be a traditional GPU that integrated some of Gaudi's features and was set to launch in 2025. Falcon Shores will no longer be a commercial product, and the new plan is to use its successor, Jaguar Shores, as the base for rack-scale AI solutions. This strategy makes sense. As AI infrastructure companies scale up data centers to include more densely packed accelerators, rack-scale solutions, which integrate GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), and other hardware across an entire server rack, can help solve thorny problems that are holding GPU clusters back..Essentially nothing is known about what Intel's rack-scale solutions are going to look like. With CEO Lip-Bu Tan taking over just a few months ago and ready to shake up the struggling company, it's not even clear whether Intel's AI strategy will change again. Tan installed a new chief technology officer (CTO) and AI chief in April who's in charge of Intel's overall AI strategy and product roadmap..Jaguar Shores almost certainly won't be ready until 2026, so any rack-scale solutions likely won't be either. Given all the changes going on at Intel, including upcoming layoffs meant to streamline the company, it could take Intel quite some time to land on a viable AI strategy and actually get competitive products and solutions to market. Meanwhile, competitor AMD is firing on all cylinders.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-runs-circles-around-intel-093000421.html," The news about AMD and Intel's AI systems primarily revolves around market competition and strategic shifts, which introduce significant risk:  1. **Market Competition Risk**: The race to develop and market rack-scale AI solutions creates intense competition. While AMD's Helios could gain an early advantage, Intel's potential swift follow-up might disrupt their lead.  2. **Strategic Shifts**: Intel's change in focus from direct sales to rack-scale solutions could alter their revenue strategy unpredictably, posing a risk if the shift doesn't yield favorable results.  3. **Potential Market Impact**: The competition may drive down prices, affecting profitability for all players and making it challenging for smaller competitors or startups to establish a foothold.  In summary, the risks stem from market competition dynamics and strategic shifts in both companies' approaches, potentially influencing their ability to maintain or achieve competitive advantages."

As such, the space is still one of the most promising places to invest..When delving down to specific stocks to focus attention on, five of the best AI-related offerings to buy right now are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Palantir Technologies  (NASDAQ: PLTR), and GitLab (NASDAQ: GTLB). Each company has found a unique niche in the AI sector to exploit, and each has big opportunities ahead..Let's look at why these are among the best AI stocks to invest in right now for the long term..Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure. These powerful chips are used to help power AI workloads, and demand has been soaring..The company's wide moat, however, comes from its CUDA software platform. Nvidia launched CUDA two decades ago to allow developers to program its GPUs more easily. It pushed CUDA into universities and research institutions early on, which helped CUDA become the de facto software program for AI developers..In Q1, the company had an over 90% market share in the GPU space. As a result, where AI infrastructure spending goes, Nvidia is sure to follow. While a slowdown in data center spending would be a risk, right now, demand for AI chips is only getting bigger. This is being driven by cloud computing companies pouring money into AI infrastructure to keep up with demand; large tech companies and AI start-ups spending big to create new foundational AI models; and even countries making large investments to not fall behind in the AI race..As AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia remains a clear winner..Another company taking advantage of the AI infrastructure build-out is Broadcom. Rather than designing GPUs like Nvidia, it's been focused on networking components and helping customers design custom AI chips. It also added a software component when it acquired VMWare..Thus far, its strategy is paying off. Its Ethernet switches and other networking components help efficiently move data within huge AI clusters, making them an essential part of data center infrastructure. Last quarter, its AI networking revenue soared 70% and accounted for 40% of Broadcom's total AI revenue.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-artificial-intelligence-ai-082000831.html," The article discusses potential risks associated with investing in specific AI-related companies, primarily focusing on speculative risk due to its reliance on the assumption of continued growth in the AI market.

And while the industry is making progress, scaling quantum systems to tackle real-world problems remains a massive challenge, particularly for a company of QUBT’s size. Despite the broader enthusiasm for “lifting all boats” in the sector, I remain bearish on QUBT..Being the CEO of a major tech company comes with significant influence—something Nvidia’s Jensen Huang demonstrated at the GTC Paris developer conference when he declared that “quantum computing is reaching an inflection point.” While his remarks centered on Nvidia’s own innovations—like CUDA-Q, which aims to integrate quantum capabilities with classical systems—his optimism could have ripple effects across the sector. Nvidia backed its words with action in March 2025 by launching a new quantum computing research lab in Boston, reinforcing its leadership in the space..Huang’s bullish tone may inspire increased venture capital and R&D investment across the quantum ecosystem. However, skepticism persists. Many still view practical quantum applications as decades away, with the industry struggling to define clear, real-world use cases that outperform traditional supercomputers. Without a breakthrough and tangible return on investment (ROI), quantum computing remains a tough sell to potential customers seeking immediate, measurable benefits..Quantum Computing Inc. specializes in photonic, or light-based, quantum solutions, developing Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) designed to operate at room temperature and low power, features that could make the technology more accessible and cost-effective. However, the company’s focus remains on niche applications, such as remote sensing and computational chemistry, which limits its current market reach..While progress is being made in identifying use cases where quantum systems may outperform classical supercomputers, practical, scalable, and commercially viable applications are still emerging. The technology faces persistent challenges, including qubit fragility, high error rates, and scalability limitations. These machines are highly specialized and complex, suited for addressing targeted, advanced problems, but are not yet ready for broad commercial deployment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-bet-farm-says-232300046.html," The risk associated with Quantum Computing, Inc. (QUBT) is related to potential financial instability and underperformance due to scalability challenges in their quantum systems. While the stock has seen a positive rally based on optimistic outlooks from Nvidia's CEO, deeper concerns about the company's financial health and operational difficulties in scaling quantum technology could lead to unexpected losses for investors holding QUBT shares.

The former acts as the brain for computers, while the latter provides the processing power. While the market for CPUs is not nearly as robust as the one for GPUs in the data center space, it is still a nice, growing market, and AMD has been taking share..However, the company's biggest opportunity will come when the AI market shifts from training more toward inference, which is expected to eventually be the much larger market. Inference is less technically demanding than training AI models, and things such as latency, power consumption, and cost come much more into play. This should allow AMD to take some market share in the GPU space, which would fuel a lot of growth moving forward..Broadcom is another cheap chip stock with a big opportunity in front of it. The company is seeing solid growth, with revenue jumping 25% last quarter to $14.9 billion, led by a 70% surge in its networking revenue. However, it is its foray into custom AI chips that has the potential to really drive growth higher.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-best-bargain-artificial-intelligence-213000139.html," The type of risk associated with investing in AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, Salesforce, and Adobe, based on the provided article, is moderate. Here's a structured breakdown:  1. **Market Fluctuations**: The companies' valuations might decline if their growth doesn't meet expectations or if the broader market environment changes.  2. **Internal Challenges**: Companies like AMD may face competition, leadership issues, or product quality problems that could hinder their growth.  3. **Sector Volatility**: The semiconductors and AI sectors are subject to rapid changes, which can impact company valuations unexpectedly.  4. **Competitive Pressure**: High competition in both the semiconductor market (e.g., Broadcom) and SaaS space (Salesforce, Adobe) can affect performance and growth rates.  5. **AI Sector Risks**: The broader AI market could shift or face ethical challenges that might influence these companies' success.  In summary, while these investments offer potential due to the booming AI sector, they carry moderate risks tied to market conditions, competition, and each company's specific challenges. Investors should consider further research or diversification to mitigate these risks."

The investment will help the company build its first commercial power plant..Like other nuclear startups, TerraPower has been riding a wave of interest from hyperscalers, data center developers, and now chip designers. Nvidia’s venture arm, NVentures, participated in the round, marking its first energy investment..Bill Gates and HD Hyundai, both already on the cap table, also invested..TerraPower started building its first power plant in Wyoming in June 2024. The company doesn’t have approval for the reactor itself, though it expects to receive permits sometime next year. Given the Trump administration’s benign attitude toward nuclear, that timeline seems reasonable..When complete, TerraPower’s first reactor will generate 345 megawatts of electricity, striking a middle ground between today’s massive conventional reactors and tomorrow’s promised small modular reactors..TerraPower’s Natrium reactors are cooled not by water but by molten sodium. The Natrium design uses far more sodium than is required to cool the reactor. That’s by design: When demand is low, the reactor can continue operating, heating sodium that is then stored in large tanks..When demand rises again, the steam turbines can draw heat from the stored sodium. Because nuclear power plants don’t easily ramp up and down, this allows the Natrium reactors to continue operating at a steady state..The storage system is designed to produce up to 500 megawatts of electricity for more than five hours, helping to fill gaps in solar and wind generation..The startup previously pursued a different reactor design, which it hoped to complete by the mid-2020s. But after uncertainties mounted, it changed course to pursue the current Natrium design..TerraPower claims it can complete a reactor within three years after the first batch of concrete is poured for the reactor. Still, considerable site preparation and construction needs to happen before that occurs..And while there are signs that the first Natrium reactor will be cheaper than recent U.S. reactors, it won’t be cheap: The Associated Press reported last year that the bill could reach $4 billion, half of which could be shouldered by the Department of Energy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-wants-nuclear-renaissance-invests-164106419.html," Nvidia's investment in TerraPower, supported by Bill Gates, involves several key risks:  1. **Financial Risk**: The primary concern is the potential loss of revenue if the project does not yield expected returns or profits.  2. **Operational Risk**: The company faces the risk that the nuclear power project could face technical challenges, regulatory issues, or safety problems, which might undermine their operations and profitability.  3. **Market Risk**: There's a risk that the trend towards renewable energy may shift, leading to reduced interest from hyperscalers and data center developers, thereby affecting Nvidia's customer base and revenue streams.  4. **Regulatory Risk**: Fluctuations in government policies on nuclear power could impact the viability of TerraPower's operations and subsequently affect Nvidia's investment.  5. **Competitive Risk**: The presence of established players in the renewable energy sector may lead to increased competition, potentially altering market dynamics and reducing perceived value for Nvidia's investments.  6. **Resource Allocation Risk**: Investing heavily in a nuclear power project might divert resources away from their core data center business, affecting their main growth strategy.  In conclusion, while the investment could open new opportunities, the potential risks are significant enough to warrant careful monitoring and strategic planning by Nvidia."

China’s system is improving but remains cumbersome, they said, contrary to Trump’s assurances rare earths would flow “up front” after a June 11 accord struck in London..The delays are holding an array of American industries hostage to the rocky US-China relationship, as some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China. That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing in Geneva last month, and triggering fresh rounds of retaliation..Interviews with multiple Western buyers, industry insiders and officials familiar with discussions revealed frustration over vague policies in both countries and lingering confusion about what level of magnet approvals from China would trigger Trump to abandon his tit-for-tat export curbs..“Even if export approvals accelerate, there are so many unknowns about the licensing regime that it’s impossible for companies to have a strong sense of certainty about future supply,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “At a minimum, they need to factor in a real possibility that talks could break down again, and exports will be halted.”.In response to China’s sluggishness on magnets, Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China until President Xi Jinping restores rare-earth exports.

After hitting a low in early April, Wall Street staged a strong rebound fueled by renewed optimism over trade negotiations, solid corporate earnings, easing inflation and continued momentum in artificial intelligence.Technology stocks led the charge, with the Magnificent Seven making a powerful comeback after months of turbulence.As the half-year mark approaches, the S&P 500 is now less than 3% below its record high, while the Nasdaq Composite is 3.4% off its all-time peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, remains only marginally positive for the year. Volatility is expected to persist in the second half.Let’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:.On April 2, Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs dubbed “Liberation Day” tariffs. These included a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imports, with a few exceptions such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber. On top of the baseline, Trump introduced “reciprocal” tariffs that targeted specific countries. China faced tariffs ranging from 34% to 54%, the European Union 20%, Japan 24% and Vietnam up to 46%. These tariffs officially took effect on April 9.Facing backlash and international criticism, the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for over 75 countries on May 12, though the 10% baseline tariff remained in place. Additionally, Chinese tariffs were reduced from a peak of 145% to around 30%, though they remained substantially elevated. On May 30, Trump doubled tariffs on imported steel, raising them from 25% to 50%, citing national security concerns and the need to protect U.S. industry.These actions faced legal scrutiny. On May 28, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that many of the tariffs were illegal under international trade law. However, the court also issued a stay, meaning the tariffs would remain in place pending appeals.These tariff policies triggered an initial market rout, with trillions lost in just days. However, the partial pause in tariffs and the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady led to a strong rebound. Some sectors emerged as clear winners. Companies like Palantir Technologies PLTR surged more than 90% since the April sell-off and recently hit a new all-time high.

The new target reflects significant upside potential for Nvidia in the second half of the year, backed by robust demand across the company’s supply chain..The rating affirmation asserts that Barclays continues to feel optimistic about NVIDIA’s market potential and performance trajectory. Conducting checks with the supply chain after first-quarter earnings, the firm has identified approximately “$2 billion in upside in July for Nvidia vs. Street numbers.” This has led to a lift in its full-year Compute revenue estimate to $37 billion from $35.6 billion..Even though Blackwell’s capacity at an estimated 30,000 wafers per month in June fell short of the firm’s expectations of 40,000 wafers, the firm asserted that “utilizations are healthy, and the supply chain sounds positive on the 2H of the year.”.Meanwhile, Blackwell Ultra is on track, and its mass production is scheduled for the third quarter. According to analysts, “both Ultra and higher volume should help gross margins (GMs) in the 2H.” The firm has therefore revised its Compute revenue forecasts for the third and fourth calendar quarters to $42 billion and $48 billion, respectively. This is above its prior projections and the Street consensus..“Even with the recent run, this name has the most potential upside in our coverage for the 2H and we raise our PT to $200.” -Analysts led by Tom O’Malley..NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services..While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Great to be here, Ricky..Ricky Mulvey: Good to have you on a day where we're getting some home sales data. As I was looking through the headlines this morning, I got three headlines that, all of which seem to be telling different stories. From CNBC. Home sales last month dropped to their slowest march pace since 2009. From Bloomberg, US new home sales top all estimates on surge in the South. From the Wall Street Journal, home sales in March fell about six percent biggest drop since 2022. Which one are you buying here?.Matt Argersinger: I'm going to buy the CNBC headline only because I love data points that go back way long in time. The fact that we're at the slowest sales pace since 2009, I mean, remember from a moment where we were in 2009. That's right.

Sign Up Now!.Have investors looking to add Nvidia to their portfolios missed the train, or is there still time to load up on the stock, which is up 8.3% on a YTD basis? Let’s find out..Not even a decade ago, Nvidia was a niche company, mostly popular among gamers for its GPUs. Now, after 10 years its shares have soared more than 28,000%, driving the company to a valuation above $3.5 trillion. Nvidia is also closing in on new record highs as it is just 5% shy of the record $153.13 set early in January..The company that designs and sells advanced chips and software platforms — primarily for AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous systems – counts tech majors such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and nearly every major AI and cloud company as its customer..From hyperscalers to sovereign AI, Nvidia is becoming more and more irreplaceable. Central to this are Nvidia’s Blackwell chips..According to Huang’s keynote at GTC 2025, “The Blackwell architecture significantly enhances AI model training and inference, enabling more efficient and scalable AI applications. And the next evolution of the Nvidia Blackwell AI factory platform, Blackwell Ultra, will be coming to systems in the second half of this year.”.Further bolstering its dominance in the GPU industry, where it already commands a near-monopoly with a-greater-than-90% market share, Nvidia has outlined a compelling product roadmap that is expected to reinforce its leadership position even more firmly. In addition to the Blackwell Ultra platform, the company is progressing toward launching next-generation GPU systems such as the Vera Rubin NVL144, which is anticipated in the second half of 2026, and the Rubin Ultra NVL576, scheduled for release a year later in late 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-quickly-approaching-record-high-113002880.html," Based on the analysis of the given news headline and description regarding Nvidia's stock performance, the following conclusions are drawn:  1. **Market Risk**: The upward trend towards a new record high may attract more investor attention, potentially leading to increased volatility as market sentiment shifts.  2. **Company-Specific Risk**: No significant issues or changes in earnings are mentioned, suggesting positive internal factors contributing to the stock's recent performance.  3. **Competitive Risk**: While AMD is a notable competitor with advancing GPU products, no specific developments from AMD affecting Nvidia's position are highlighted.  4. **Economic Risk**: The impact of broader economic factors like interest rates or global demand isn't detailed in the news.  5. **Market Sentiment**: The return of ""mojo"" suggests resilience and positive investor sentiment, though unexpected changes can still occur.  **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, there is no immediate identified risk to Nvidia's stock based on its upward trend and market conditions. However, ongoing competition from AMD or shifts in economic factors could pose future risks not yet reflected."

Long-term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it smooths out short-term volatility to let a company's fundamentals shine through.  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors know this better than most.,"Nvidia has witnessed explosive growth as generative AI hit the scene..Can the chipmaker maintain its momentum as the technology matures?.10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Long-term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it smooths out short-term volatility to let a company's fundamentals shine through. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors know this better than most. If they managed to hold through the ups and downs, they would have a return of almost 800% over the last three years..That said, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a brand-new industry that can maintain itself off of hype. Costs will need to fall, and consumer-facing AI software companies will need to develop more-compelling monetization strategies. Let's explore what the near future might hold for Nvidia and this burgeoning industry as a whole..The market reacted well to Nvidia's first-quarter earnings (shares are up 7% since they were released on May 28). But the results were a mix of good and bad news. Revenue jumped 69% year over year to $44.1 billion, but this is a sharp deceleration from the corresponding period last year when sales grew by 262%..There are several reasons for this weakness. For starters, the Trump administration severely restricted  export of the company's H20 chips to China, leading to a $4.5 billion impairment charge as it had to write down the value of excess inventory and purchase agreements. And while overall AI chip demand is still huge, there are some early signs that its specific business model could eventually hit a plateau..More and more companies are investing in custom-built chips that can be cheaper and more efficient than the company's one-size-fits-all solutions for specific workloads. Amazon has its Trainium and Inferentia chips, while Alphabet has its Tensor processing units (TPUs) designed to rival Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. .OpenAI is also working with the chipmaker's key supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, to potentially reduce its reliance on Nvidia's hardware..As the AI industry becomes more mature, companies will probably seek competitive advantages through custom hardware design. And while Nvidia's powerful chip remains crucial in the nascent stages of the industry, it is unclear how much longer its economic moat will last. .Nvidia's biggest customers could potentially become its rivals in AI chip design, giving them an incentive to replace its products wherever possible and making it crucial for the company to find business outside the private sector. Management is doing exactly that. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-nvidia-stock-3-years-113000301.html," The analysis classifies the risk as ""High Risk: High Volatility."" This classification is based on the inherent risks associated with holding NVIDIA's stock over a three-year period. The key factors contributing to this risk include:  1. **Market Volatility**: The stock market can experience significant price fluctuations, leading to unpredictable short-term movements in NVIDIA's stock value.  2. **Technology Advancements**: While generative AI is expected to drive growth, its impact on NVIDIA could be subject to change if it turns out to be overhyped or if other unforeseen technological breakthroughs emerge.  3. **Economic Conditions**: Overall economic stability and market trends can influence the stock's performance, adding another layer of uncertainty.  4. **Regulatory Changes**: Potential regulatory shifts in technology sectors may impact NVIDIA's business environment and stock value.  While long-term investors might benefit from smoothed-out volatility due to inherent growth potential, the primary risk here is the high volatility itself, which introduces unpredictability and market fluctuations that can affect investment stability over a three-year horizon."
2025-06-20 20:15:00,2 Vanguard ETFs That Can Turn $300 per Month Into Over $1 Million,Vanguard funds are well-known for their incredibly low expense ratios.  Investing a regular amount of money into the stock market each month can be an excellent way to grow your savings and build up a portfolio that's eventually worth $1 million or more.  A couple of low-cost Vanguard ETFs to consider for this purpose include the Vanguard Growth Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VGT).,"These funds focus on the best growth and tech stocks in the world..Both have generated returns in excess of 300% over the past decade..Vanguard funds are well-known for their incredibly low expense ratios..10 stocks we like better than Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF ›.Investing a regular amount of money into the stock market each month can be an excellent way to grow your savings and build up a portfolio that's eventually worth $1 million or more. But it can be challenging to do, especially since you have to ensure you can continue to afford making monthly investments, and then picking which investments to make with that money. Amid volatile economic conditions, that's no easy task..You can, however, simplify the process by going with some solid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can diversify your portfolio and set you up for some great growth opportunities in the future. A couple of low-cost Vanguard ETFs to consider for this purpose include the Vanguard Growth Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VGT). .Here's why investing $300 per month into either one of these ETFs could put you on track to generating a $1 million portfolio in the future..The Vanguard Growth Index Fund is a great, growth-focused ETF you can add to your portfolio. It charges an expense ratio of only 0.04%, which means you don't have to worry about high fees chipping away at your gains..What's attractive about this fund is that it focuses on large-cap growth stocks. These are the types of investments that can drive long-run returns for your portfolio and make the most of your money. Stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, and Nvidia are all among its top-10 holdings. These are leaders within their respective industries, and their businesses are synonymous with growth. With more than 160 stocks in total, this is a well-diversified ETF to simply buy and hold. It also yields around 0.5%..Over the past decade, the ETF has achieved total returns (which include dividend payments) of approximately 327%. That averages out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.6%..But for the sake of being conservative, let's assume that its returns will slow down given how hot the market has been in the past few years and how it's reaching record levels. If the ETF averages a return of about 10% for the very long haul (which is in line with the S&P 500's long-term average), then a $300 per-month investment could grow to more than $1 million after a period of 34 years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-vanguard-etfs-turn-300-111500637.html," The analysis of the article suggests that the risk involved in investing $300 monthly into Vanguard ETFs like VUG and VGT is minimal or non-existent.   **Risk Classification:** No risk.  This conclusion is based on the following reasoning: - The ETFs are known for their low expense ratios, reducing costs and enhancing returns. - They are actively managed index funds tracking broad indices, offering diversification with low concentration risk. - The strategy of dollar-cost averaging mitigates market timing risks, though it's not inherently risky. - No specific risks like liquidity issues or concentration points were highlighted in the article.  Thus, the investment approach is considered safe and passive, focusing on long-term growth potential."
2025-06-20 16:15:00,Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Broadcom,"Broadcom stock has delivered stronger returns than Nvidia in the past year.  Despite its larger revenue base, Nvidia continues to grow faster than Broadcom.  A look at valuations helps clarify which AI stock is the better one right now.","Broadcom stock has delivered stronger returns than Nvidia in the past year..Despite its larger revenue base, Nvidia continues to grow faster than Broadcom..A look at valuations helps clarify which AI stock is the better one right now..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are the leading players in the artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor space, with both chip designers being the dominant forces in their respective niches..Nvidia controls the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which has been thriving thanks to the need for massive computing power required to train AI models. Broadcom, on the other hand, commands the lion's share of the custom AI processor market, which has been gaining traction because of AI inference..However, both stocks have witnessed divergent fortunes on the market in the past year, with Broadcom's gains of 45% significantly outpacing Nvidia's jump of 9%. Does this make Broadcom the better AI stock of the two? Let's find out..Broadcom's custom AI processors are in great demand right now as they are being deployed in huge numbers by cloud hyperscalers for AI inferencing (where a trained AI model draws conclusions based on new data). The company has three customers that are expected to deploy more than 1 million units each of its custom AI processors in their cloud clusters in 2027..That would be a big jump over the 30,000 units of its custom AI processors deployed in each cloud cluster by its customers last year..The reason its custom AI processors are in such great demand is because of their ability to perform the tasks they are designed for more efficiently when compared to GPUs, thereby lowering the operating cost. Reports suggest that the company's custom AI chips can be two to three times faster than GPUs, and they consume 30% less power..This is the reason hyperscalers such as Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and others have been building custom AI chips for their servers. And the number of customers using Broadcom's AI chips is likely to go up to seven from the current three. The chipmaker reportedly designs chips for Alphabet, Meta, and ByteDance at present, and there are indications that it could add the likes of Oracle, xAI, and SoftBank to its list as well..This potential expansion of the company's AI customer base could help it sustain its impressive 70% share of the custom AI processor market. This could pave the way for outstanding revenue growth in the long run considering that the custom AI chip market is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 32% through 2030.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-104500990.html," The analysis reveals several key risk factors for both Nvidia and Broadcom in their AI sector competition:  1. **Market and Sector Risk**: The tech sector is inherently volatile, with AI's rapid growth amplifying these fluctuations. Both companies face risks tied to market conditions within this dynamic field.  2. **Financial Health**: Nvidia exhibits higher revenue and earnings growth but lower return on investment compared to Broadcom. This discrepancy could indicate financial challenges or less efficient profit utilization, posing a risk for investors seeking consistent performance.  3. **Operational Risks**: Nvidia's reliance on semiconductors introduces supply chain dependency risks, which could impact performance during scaling periods. Additionally, the lack of specific details on other operational issues (e.g., regulatory concerns) adds uncertainty.  4. **Competitive Landscape**: While both companies are strong players in AI, they operate within a competitive environment where new entrants and evolving technologies may challenge their growth trajectory.  In summary, the primary risk for investors is related to sector-specific volatility, financial performance discrepancies, and operational dependencies. Nvidia's higher growth potential contrasts with its current return performance, indicating a higher risk profile due to reliance on rapid revenue expansion that may not translate into stable returns."

In other words, there seems at least a solid probability that Nvidia stock still has not just good or even great but amazing growth potential left. Think of it as ""Nvidia the superstar stock 2.0."".I say ""at the risk of sounding like I've lost my mind"" because I understand the law of large numbers strongly works against my thesis. This ""law"" basically means that the larger a company becomes, the more difficult it becomes to continue to grow revenue and earnings at a strong pace on a year-over-year percentage basis. And year-over-year earnings (and cash flow) growth is what largely powers stock prices higher..Nvidia is massive. It has a market cap of $3.55 trillion, as of June 18, making it the world's second most valuable publicly traded company, trailing Microsoft by just a sliver. Moreover, Nvidia management expects the company to generate revenue of $45 billion in its fiscal second quarter, which equates to an annual revenue run rate of $180 billion..To be clear -- I think it's highly unlikely that Nvidia will ever again be able to pump out a long consecutive string of year-over-year quarterly earnings growth in the very high double-digit to triple-digit percentages. But I don't think it has to do that in order to deliver stellar returns to investors for some time. Year-over-year earnings growth solidly in the double-digits plus a reasonable stock valuation should be all that's needed to keep investors very happy..What makes me have confidence in the ""reasonable valuation"" bit?.Currently, Nvidia stock's valuation is reasonable by just about every measure, but that has not always been true. (For reference, it's trading at 25.4 times Wall Street's projected forward earnings per share, or EPS, as of June 18. That's an attractive valuation for a company that analysts expect will grow EPS at an average annual rate of 30% over the next five years.)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-next-nvidia-stock-actually-100000222.html," The article discusses the possibility of investors seeking ""the next Nvidia stock,"" which might involve speculative investments in companies with similar potential to Nvidia. This scenario carries a risk profile classified as:  **Speculative Risk**  This risk arises from the inherent uncertainty and high volatility associated with speculative investments, where the potential for significant gains exists but also a substantial chance of loss if the investment does not perform as expected."

TSMC is already investing up to $165bn in US-based chip plants..Read more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Markets upbeat as UK and EU begin talks on Iran and Trump sets two week deadline.Son is also said to be approaching other major technology players, including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), as part of a broader push to attract private-sector participation in the venture. Talks with both federal and state officials in the US have included discussions of potential tax incentives designed to draw investment to the region..A $1tn commitment would be double the size of the $500bn “Stargate” initiative — a separate megaproject backed by SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) aimed at expanding US data centre capacity to support the next wave of artificial intelligence development..Shares in Pop Mart (9992.HK) fell sharply in Hong Kong trading on Friday after a Chinese state media commentary called for tighter regulation of blind-box toys and trading cards, a move that rattled investors and raised concerns over the company’s lucrative Labubu doll business..The Beijing-based toymaker, which has a market capitalisation of roughly $40bn, saw its shares drop as much as 6% during the session, extending a 5.3% decline on Thursday. The sell-off came despite the fact that the commentary did not mention Pop Mart by name..The warning stoked fears of a regulatory crackdown on the blind-box model, a sales strategy in which consumers purchase toys without knowing which character they will receive. Pop Mart’s success has been built largely on this model, fuelling a frenzy among collectors and driving a nearly 170% rally in its shares so far this year..Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio.Much of that surge has been driven by the popularity of the company’s signature Labubu dolls — wide-eyed, toothy monster figurines that have become a cult hit among young Chinese consumers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pop-mart-snowflake-salesforce-nvidia-trending-tickers-094115098.html," The risks associated with the mentioned tickers can be classified as follows:  1. **SoftBank**: Market risk due to its ownership in Salesforce potentially making it liable for any issues faced by the latter.  2. **Pop Mart (assuming Popcorn Mart)**: Geopolitical and macroeconomic risks, including exposure to inflation, interest rates, and global demand fluctuations.  3. **Snowflake**: Regulatory risks related to data sensitivity and potential government interference or changes in regulations.  4. **Salesforce**: Market risk due to its high market cap dependency on enterprise software sales, which can be volatile.  5. **Nvidia**: Supply chain and operational risks associated with semiconductor production challenges and cyclical consumer demand for graphics hardware.

The MI400 series is coming next year and expected to deliver a tenfold increase in performance.  MI400 and AMD's Helios rack-scale solution can help the company grow its AI chip business, although Nvidia will likely remain the overwhelming market leader.","AMD launched its MI350X and MI355X AI accelerators, which compete with Nvidia's Blackwell products..The MI400 series is coming next year and expected to deliver a tenfold increase in performance..MI400 and AMD's Helios rack-scale solution can help the company grow its AI chip business, although Nvidia will likely remain the overwhelming market leader..10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has built a sizable AI accelerator business over the past few years, but it's a drop in the bucket compared with market leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). While Nvidia's data center segment generated more than $39 billion in revenue during the most recent quarter alone, AMD managed just $5 billion in AI accelerator revenue in all of 2024..AMD's latest Instinct MI350X and MI355X graphics processing units (GPUs) are powerful, delivering four times the AI compute performance and 35 times the AI inferencing performance compared to the company's last-generation products. However, specifications and performance are in line with Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based GPUs. AMD's chips feature 288 GB of HBM3E memory and 8 terabytes per second (TB/s) of memory bandwidth, the same as Nvidia's GB300 Superchip. Raw compute performance across different types of operations is also similar to Nvidia's latest. While AMD's MI350X and MI355X are capable AI accelerators, they fail to leapfrog Nvidia..In 2026, AMD will release its next-generation MI400 series AI accelerators. The company claims that the flagship MI400X will be 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, an enormous leap in just a few years. The chips will feature up to 432 GB of HBM4 memory, 19.6 TB/s memory bandwidth, and significant increases in raw computing performance..Of course, Nvidia won't be sitting still. Nvidia's Vera Rubin chips are expected to ship in the second half of 2026, bringing significant performance gains over Blackwell. The initial Rubin AI accelerator will keep memory per GPU at 288 GB but up the bandwidth to 13 TB/s, while Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027 pile on additional memory and bandwidth. Rubin is expected to more than triple compute performance over its predecessor..While companies' claims about the performance of future products should be taken with a grain of salt, AMD's MI400X looks like it will be a solid contender when it launches in 2026. It should beat Nvidia's current generation of products handily in terms of performance, although Nvidia's next-gen Rubin chips may ultimately win out. One advantage AMD will have is memory, with the MI400X set to offer more capacity and bandwidth than Rubin. For certain types of workloads, that will be appealing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-amd-finally-challenge-nvidia-092000398.html," The primary financial risk AMD faces with the introduction of the MI400 AI chips is the uncertainty surrounding its actual performance compared to expectations. While the anticipated tenfold increase in performance could significantly boost revenue and market share, potential risks include:  1. **Performance underperformance**: If the MI400 does not deliver as expected, it may fail to capture the anticipated market share and could negatively impact AMD's financials.  2. **Market competition**: DespiteMI400's strengths, Nvidia remains the dominant player in the AI chip market. This continued leadership might limit the impact of AMD's new chips on overall market growth.  3. **Customer adoption concerns**: The rapid pace of technology changes might result in delays in customer adoption for AMD's MI400 chips, potentially affecting sales and revenue streams.  In summary, while the MI400 presents an opportunity to challenge Nvidia and gain market share, the associated risks stem from the need to meet performance targets and successfully integrate these chips into existing customer bases."

Data center-related capital expenditures could reach $1 trillion annually by 2028.  The closest companies to reaching that milestone are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).,"Nvidia management is excited about the company's long-term growth potential..Data center-related capital expenditures could reach $1 trillion annually by 2028..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.There has never been a $5 trillion company. The closest companies to reaching that milestone are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Both companies have market capitalizations of around $3.5 trillion. Using their current growth trajectories as a guide, they could reach that $5 trillion mark in a few years. But which one will get there first?.The signs point to Nvidia, based on its impressive growth and the increasing market for its products. Although Nvidia has made investors a boatload of money over the past few years, there's still plenty ahead, making it an attractive stock to own right now..Here's why Nvidia has the potential to be the first $5 trillion company by 2028..Nvidia's rise goes hand-in-hand with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of data centers that help process AI computations. AI hyperscalers (large-scale cloud service providers that offer massive computing resources, storage, and networking infrastructure) like Microsoft are racing to install as much equipment as possible to run AI workloads. That way, they can profit from the various companies running AI on their servers by charging usage fees..While multiple companies are pursuing this approach, Nvidia is the main supplier of the graphics processing units (GPUs) central to their operation. And while there are alternatives to Nvidia's products, it has a 90% or greater share in the data center GPU market, similar to Alphabet's dominance in the search engine industry (through Google). This helps put Nvidia's dominance into perspective. Even better, the demand for data centers is growing far quicker than the growth in Search..Nearly every AI hyperscaler has announced record data center capital expenditures in 2025. Planning, developing, and constructing the sites on which these centers are built takes years, so this heightened spending will persist for multiple years. A third-party estimate Nvidia cited during its 2025 GTC event said global data center spending was $400 billion in 2024, but it is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028..For reference, during FY 2025 (which encompasses most of 2024), Nvidia's data center division delivered $115 billion in revenue. So, for every $100 spent on data centers, about $29 went to Nvidia..What will this mean for Nvidia in the future?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-090000525.html," The article discusses the potential growth of Nvidia into a $5 trillion market by 2028 through significant data center investments. However, several risks are identified:  1. **Overambitious Predictions**: The target is extremely high and may not be achievable due to unforeseen market conditions or shifts in investment preferences.  2. **Competition**: The rise of Microsoft in the same sector could lead to increased competition, affecting growth rates for both companies.  3. **Market Dynamics Changes**: Shifts in economic conditions, regulatory changes, or changes in business models might impact data center spending more than anticipated.  4. **AI Sector Challenges**: Broader challenges within AI technology, such as ethical issues and privacy concerns, could affect the sector's potential.  5. **Investor Reaction**: The market may react negatively if the prediction is seen as overly optimistic, leading to price volatility before actual results are realized.  These factors collectively present significant risks that could impact the accuracy of the predicted growth for Nvidia."

Though these companies have helped shareholders score a major win quarter after quarter and could continue to climb, some investors now are looking beyond these names that have constantly been on center stage. They aim to find the next big AI success story, and one that has emerged in recent times is CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV)..This tech company is new to the market, having launched its initial public offering in March, and the stock already has soared more than 320% from that point. Investors are excited about this new AI investing opportunity, especially considering the company has been delivering triple-digit revenue growth. Could investing $10,000 in CoreWeave make you a millionaire? Let's find out..So, first, let's talk a little bit about this new-to-the-market company that's outperformed well-established tech giants such as the Magnificent Seven companies so far this year. CoreWeave actually is closely linked to the world's most talked-about AI company, Nvidia, and this may be part of the reason why investors are so excited about its future..This company's main business is offering customers access to its giant fleet -- 250,000 to be exact -- of Nvidia chips across more than 30 data centers. These graphics processing units (GPUs) may be rented for long periods of time or simply by hour, offering customers great flexibility for their AI workloads. Since demand has been extremely high, even surpassing supply, for Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture and chip, investors clearly are optimistic about CoreWeave's prospects too. CoreWeave even was the first to make this new architecture generally available to customers, highlighting its ability to serve customers fast with the latest innovations..And the fact that market giant Nvidia holds a 7% stake in CoreWeave is another element that could appeal to investors. Nvidia's backing suggests this young company is set to play a key role in the next phases of the AI story..A look at CoreWeave's growth so far shows great momentum, with revenue soaring more than 400% in the first quarter. And even considering uncertainties in recent months that have pressured the stock market, CoreWeave says customer demand still increased. In fact, the big challenge right now is to scale up and meet demand. This requires significant investment, and that means investors should expect spending to increase moving forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-investing-10-000-coreweave-071500434.html," The investment in CoreWeave presents an opportunity for significant returns but comes with associated risks. Here's a breakdown of the identified risks:  1. **Market Risk:** The stock has experienced rapid growth, but future performance is uncertain due to the company's relatively new status (just IPOed) and market volatility.  2. **Liquidity Risk:** As a newly listed company, CoreWeave may have limited liquidity, making it difficult to sell shares quickly at a fair price if needed.  3. **Concentration Risk:** Investing heavily in one AI stock could lead to concentration risk, as the tech industry is competitive and shifts in market dynamics might affect performance compared to other companies.  **Conclusion:** While there's potential for high returns, investors should be aware of these risks before making their investment decision."

Analysts expect the AI market to reach into the trillions of dollars in the coming years, which suggests some of today's early players in the field could benefit -- and so could investors who buy now and hold.  President Donald Trump announced tariffs on imports, and investors worried that such duties would lift prices -- which would weigh on consumers' wallets and companies' budgets.","Both of these stocks roared higher last year, but slid earlier this year..These companies are delivering strong revenue growth now, and the momentum should continue..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the market's biggest winners last year as investors flocked to this area of great opportunity. Analysts expect the AI market to reach into the trillions of dollars in the coming years, which suggests some of today's early players in the field could benefit -- and so could investors who buy now and hold..But this investing theme lost its momentum temporarily a couple of months ago. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on imports, and investors worried that such duties would lift prices -- which would weigh on consumers' wallets and companies' budgets. All this represented bad news for the economy and corporate earnings..In recent weeks, though, investors have shrugged off their most negative thoughts as initial trade deals and talks between the U.S. and China have led to renewed optimism. On top of this, positive economic data -- from consumer sentiment to inflation figures -- also calmed investors' fears. All of this has helped indexes rally, and this bodes well for growth stocks such as AI companies in the months to come..Let's zoom in on two AI stocks that could soar in the second half of 2025..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have become used to major gains,as this top AI chip designer's shares soared 800% over the past two calendar years. But as of the start of this year, performance weakened amid the concerns I mentioned and the idea that Nvidia customers may rein in spending. Evidence from these customers, though, from Meta Platforms to Alphabet, shows investing in AI remains a priority -- and this is excellent news for Nvidia..Meanwhile, Nvidia's latest quarterly earnings report highlights this ongoing spending in AI, as revenue surged 69% to $44 billion. The company continues to see strong demand for its new Blackwell architecture and chip, especially in the area of inference, or the ""thinking"" an AI model must do to solve problems. Inferencing could represent a significant growth driver in the next stages of the AI story, so strength here is key..Of course, Nvidia may face increased competition in the years ahead, but I'm confident that the company's leadership now and pledge to innovate annually will keep it a few steps ahead of its rivals. The tech giant has already set out its roadmap for chip releases through 2028, offering us evidence that it's well on the way to reaching its innovation goals.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-070800736.html," The analysis of the news article about AI stocks indicates that while there is significant growth potential in the AI sector, there are notable risks associated with it:  1. **Uncertainty of Tariffs**: The announcement of tariffs introduces uncertainty regarding their implementation. Investors face ambiguity as they do not know whether Trump will follow through on his threat or if other countries will retaliate.  2. **Global Supply Chain Impact**: Potential tariffs could disrupt global supply chains, affecting various industries that rely on imported goods and services. This disruption might lead to increased costs for businesses, impacting their budgets and potentially affecting consumer prices.  3. **Market Volatility**: The sudden introduction of unexpected trade policies can cause market volatility. Investors may react negatively, selling off assets quickly, which could result in a decline in AI stock values if fear outweighs confidence.  4. **Lack of Specific Impact Details**: The article lacks specifics on how tariffs will affect prices or particular industries, making it difficult for investors to accurately assess their impact and plan accordingly.  In conclusion, while AI presents a long-term growth opportunity, the risks related to tariff uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, market volatility, and unclear impacts pose significant considerations for investors. These factors necessitate careful risk management and consideration of alternative strategies or hedging approaches."

Therefore, considering the market risk, potential investors might face uncertainty as quantum computing technology is still emerging, leading to fluctuating stock prices.  2. **Concentration Risk**: By avoiding IonQ, an investor diversifies their portfolio. However, if the alternative quantum computing company does not perform well, it could affect overall portfolio performance and expose the investor to concentration risk.  3. **Liquidity Risk**: The article implies that the alternative company might not be as liquid or widely followed. This could pose challenges for selling shares quickly, increasing transaction costs and market impact.  In conclusion, while switching investments can mitigate some risks through diversification, other specific risks such as market volatility and liquidity issues remain potential concerns."

2025-06-20 01:36:00,"The Week in AI: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked.""","A new civil war in AI, Andreessen's rant, and Zuck splashes the pot.","Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.""CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA NVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in ""the revolution"" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up after Apple AAPL researchers released their paper ""The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.""We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models ""give up"" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply ""token prediction"" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the ""vibe-coding"" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the ""limitations"" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled ""The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking."" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the ""top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted"" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article ""This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.""And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work ""as fast as possible""...""Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.""Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the ""Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.""I have several posts in the comments of the ""The Week in AI"" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.""Translation: AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: ""The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle."" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled ""The Gentle Singularity.""I call it his ""love letter"" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a ""symbiosis between people and AI"" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of ""post-labor economics"" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the ""not-so-gentle"" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be ""hip.""On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing that Alphabet GOOGL is ""firing on all cylinders across AI"" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last ""search is dead"" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta Platforms META plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be ""mined and modeled"" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough, Advanced Micro Devices AMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...""The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?""It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.""I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer ""thinking."" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other ""intelligence experts"" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line: To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

2025-06-20 02:25:00,Is China's RISC-V Pivot Undermining Arm's Growth Prospects?,"ARM faces slowing growth in China as the country accelerates its RISC-V shift, threatening market share and future upside.","Arm Holdings ARM is increasingly at risk of slower growth in China due to the country’s accelerating pivot toward RISC-V architecture. In fiscal 2025, China was the company’s second-largest revenue source after the United States, contributing 19% of its total sales. However, revenues from China rose only 7.5% year over year, a concerning signal in a country with deep chip demand and vast industrial needs..This sluggish pace appears tightly linked to China’s growing ambition to localize its semiconductor ecosystem. As part of this strategy, the Chinese government is preparing to promote RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture, as an alternative to Arm’s and x86’s proprietary models. Because RISC-V enables customization without licensing fees, it offers significant cost advantages and design flexibility, which are key priorities for China as it seeks to reduce dependence on Western technologies amid ongoing geopolitical tensions..The Chinese ecosystem is already moving fast. Major tech firms such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei, Tencent and ZTE are premier members of RISC-V International. Alibaba’s XuanTie and Nuclei System Technology are leading domestic providers of RISC-V chips, and the recent unveiling of RIVAI Technologies’ high-performance Lingyu server chip demonstrates China’s growing capabilities in advanced RISC-V innovation. As the Chinese government finalizes policy guidance to back this transition, Arm’s foothold may weaken further, especially if local champions continue gaining traction..While Arm may feel the brunt of China’s RISC-V push, NVIDIA NVDA and AMD AMD are watching closely..NVIDIA has a deep exposure in AI hardware and data centers, both critical segments where RISC-V could encroach if local alternatives scale effectively. Its ecosystem depends on international design freedom — something RISC-V threatens in China’s closed-loop ambitions..Meanwhile, AMD faces a similar challenge. Its EPYC server chips compete directly with China’s new Lingyu RISC-V server chip. If adoption accelerates in China, AMD’s market share in hyperscale and enterprise deployments could erode..Both NVIDIA and AMD now must navigate a dual challenge — innovation and geopolitical barriers. With China leaning into RISC-V, both companies will likely reassess their regional strategies as Arm’s struggles become theirs as well..The stock has gained 18% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 5% rally.. .>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-risc-v-pivot-undermining-172500539.html," The news article identifies a competitive risk where ARM could face challenges in maintaining its market share in China as the country accelerates the adoption of RISC-V architecture. This shift threatens ARM's growth prospects due to its potential dominance by competitors using RISC-V chips, which are increasingly popular for their efficiency and low power consumption in tech industries. While there may be opportunities for innovation within this trend, the primary risk lies in ARM not adapting adequately to this competitive pressure."

Certain AI companies remain in his portfolio -- like Amazon -- but he's recently exited others..He sold two of 2024's biggest AI winners, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies. He closed out his position in the former in the third quarter of last year and sold all of the latter in the first quarter of this year..Investors don't know the exact reason for the Palantir cut, though it's reasonable to guess valuation may have had something to do with it. The stock trades for 237x forward earnings estimates today, prompting some to say it's gotten too expensive and may be set for declines. Druckenmiller clearly cares about this element because he's said Nvidia's high valuation pushed him toward the exit door..Even though Nvidia's valuation has indeed climbed, this billionaire said selling Nvidia was a mistake. ""I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale,"" he told Bloomberg in an interview last year, and suggested he would consider buying the stock again at the right price..Druckenmiller hasn't done that yet -- but it's something to watch for in coming quarters as Nvidia's valuation has come down quite a bit over the past several months. Meanwhile, this top investor just made a huge move on another AI stock that has a close relationship with Nvidia. Here's a closer look..First, it's worth keeping your eye on Druckenmiller's moves as he has a strong track record of successful stock picking. This dates back to his 30 years of delivering a 30% average annual return -- and never posting a money-losing year -- as head of Duquesne Capital Management. Now he's leading the Duquesne family office and oversees $3 billion, and his moves could offer investors some inspiration when they go shopping for stocks..What sort of big AI move did Druckenmiller make in the first quarter? He increased his holding of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) by 457% to 598,780 shares..TSMC is the company that brings some of today's most sought-after products to life: AI chips. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two AI chip giants, design their chips but don't manufacture them. They and many other companies turn to TSMC for this.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-stanley-druckenmiller-made-huge-163300961.html," The analysis of Stanley Druckenmiller's decision to sell his Nvidia shares reveals several key risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The high price-to-earnings ratio (237x) suggests that the stock may experience significant price fluctuations, potentially leading to losses for investors holding it.  2. **Panic Selling**: With the stock appearing expensive and warnings from experts, there's a risk of investor panic selling, which could exacerbate market downturns.  3. **Liquidity Risk**: A sudden surge in selling interest due to fears about the stock's value could reduce market liquidity, making it difficult for traders to execute buy or sell orders without affecting prices further.  4. **AI Performance Concerns**: Even though Druckenmiller is optimistic about AI's future, there is uncertainty if its impact will meet expectations, which could affect Nvidia's performance and subsequent stock price.  5. **Tech Stock Volatility**: Tech stocks are inherently volatile, so any significant event like this can cause unexpected swings in the market value of individual stocks.

What's unique, however, is that the usual suspects of Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon aren't really pegged to the rising interest in quantum computing technology..Rather, a new cohort of rising stars such as Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) are among the most popular quantum computing stocks right now. With shares down by 25% from their peak over the last year, IonQ stock trades for roughly $40 as of this writing. Is now a good opportunity to pounce on the stock?.Quantum computing is not a widely used application in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Yet despite its developmental stage, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that quantum computing could be a $131 billion opportunity in the coming decades. With the potential for such enormous upside, it's not entirely surprising that investors were quick to look at which companies are involved with quantum computing development..One reason that I think IonQ has emerged as a favorite in the quantum computing market is the company's impressive partnerships with cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. With the stock sliding as of late, investors may be wondering if the sell-off is an opportunity to buy the dip..Despite working with major AI developers, IonQ has little to show in terms of tangible growth. Over the last year, the company has only generated $43 million in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's net losses are in the hundreds of millions (and worsening)..In a way, this financial profile actually makes some sense. As I alluded to above, quantum computing is not yet commercially used in AI development. Given those dynamics, IonQ's revenue potential is fairly limited for the time being. The unfortunate reality is that the company will likely remain a high-cash-burn operation as it continues building out its platform..But still, for just $40 could IonQ be worth a look? Well, smart investors understand that the stock price alone does not determine the worth of a business. As of this writing, IonQ boasts a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. This implies that IonQ is trading for a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 195.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-25-now-time-pounce-110000459.html," The analysis of IonQ's stock situation reveals several key risks:  1. **Competition**: The quantum computing market faces intense competition from established players like D-Wave and Rigetti, which could hinder IonQ's growth.  2. **Technical Risks**: The company's reliance on qubit stability and error correction is critical. Any delays or issues here could negatively impact the stock price.  3. **Funding Usage**: The $30 million raised last year may not be optimally invested in development, potentially signaling execution issues that could affect performance.  4. **Market Perception**: Investors might underestimate IonQ's potential, leading to further declines before any recovery.  In conclusion, these factors suggest a moderate to high risk level associated with IonQ's stock at the current price point."

2025-06-19 18:30:00,Magnificent 7 May Need to Make Room for Broadcom,"Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club late last year, and its market cap has only continued to climb since.","Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club late last year, and its market value has continued to climb since. The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: OpenAI Careens Toward Messy Divorce From Microsoft and Drones Steal the Paris Air Show.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

However, based on the information provided in the news article, there is no specific risk event highlighted. The key points to consider are:  1. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: As a company with significant market capitalization, Broadcom may face increased regulatory oversight due to its size. 2. **Investor Sentiment and Volatility**: High valuations can lead to pressure on management and increased short-term volatility among investors. 3. **Overvaluation Warnings**: While not explicitly mentioned, the milestone might attract more attention from analysts, potentially leading to overvaluation warnings.  In conclusion, while there are inherent risks tied to high market capitalization, the news article itself does not present a specific risk event. Therefore, the primary classification of risk is related to increased regulatory scrutiny and investor sentiment rather than an immediate negative risk."
2025-06-20 00:08:00,Nvidia’s AI empire: A look at its top startup investments,"Over the last two years, Nvidia has used its ballooning fortunes to invest in over 80 AI startups. Here are the giant semiconductor's largest investments.","No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia (NVDA). Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared..During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups..The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.).In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds..Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”.Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round..OpenAI (OPAI.PVT): Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion..xAI (XAAI.PVT): Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later..Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ai-empire-look-top-101200402.html," The article discusses Nvidia's significant investments in multiple AI startups over two years. The primary risk associated with this activity can be classified as **market and operational risk**.  - **Market Risk**: The tech market is volatile, especially in rapidly evolving fields like AI. Rapid advancements could lead to shifts in trends, regulatory changes, or competitors' innovations that might negatively impact these investments.    - **Operational Risk**: Nvidia's substantial financial commitment in multiple startups increases the likelihood of not all investments yielding positive returns. This concentration of resources without proper diversification can expose the company to significant financial losses if some ventures fail.  These risks are compounded by the fact that Nvidia is making large bets without sufficient oversight, creating a vulnerability to market fluctuations and operational challenges."

These three each tackle AI in their own way and could be excellent long-term investments..Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed to train and run AI workloads. Its market share dominance in this industry is impressive, with most estimates pegging it at around 90%. Due to unprecedented AI demand, the GPU market has grown massively, and Nvidia's growth has been nothing short of jaw-dropping..Nvidia put up impressive growth figures over the past few years, and although the growth rate is ""slowing,"" it's hard to say that seriously when Nvidia grew revenue 69% year over year to $44 billion in Q1. It also projects it to grow by 50% in Q2, underscoring its strength..As long as there's huge AI demand, Nvidia will be a successful investment. Even with shares trading at 33 times forward earnings, it's about in line with other big tech stocks. However, Nvidia's growth and potential are far greater than many of its big tech peers, which makes it a solid stock to scoop up in June..Taiwan Semiconductor is a huge beneficiary of the massive demand that Nvidia experienced. Nvidia doesn't have the ability to produce its own chips, so it outsources that work to Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia isn't the only company that does this; nearly every big tech company that makes hardware uses chips from Taiwan Semiconductor's factories. This allows Taiwan Semi to stay neutral in the AI arms race, while benefiting from the massive spending..Investing in TSMC isn't picking a winner in the AI arms race; it's a bet that there will be increased AI spending in the future. That seems like a surefire take, so the stock will stay at the top of my buy list for the foreseeable future..Another reason I'm a Taiwan Semi bull is its stock price. Despite benefiting from multiple tailwinds, its stock hasn't achieved a premium valuation. It trades at 22.9 times forward earnings -- the same as the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-091500328.html," The news article about AI stocks and Nvidia's role presents several risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The stock market's inherent volatility can lead to sudden drops if AI deployment is delayed.  2. **Technology Maturity**: Widespread adoption may take longer than expected, causing potential losses for investors.  3. **Competition**: Increased competition from other tech giants could affect demand and valuations.  4. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Government regulations might impose constraints or bans on AI technologies.  5. **Supply Chain Risks**: Global supply chain disruptions could slow AI development.  6. **Investor Sentiment**: Market reactions due to sentiment can lead to irrational pricing, affecting stock performance.  In conclusion, the risks are significant due to potential delays in deployment, competition, regulatory impacts, and supply chain issues, which could lead to market volatility and investor losses."
2025-06-19 16:44:00,Here's How Many Shares of Nvidia Stock You Should Own to Get $500 in Yearly Dividends,"Spoiler: You'll need to buy a lot of Nvidia shares.  Dividend income can be a lifesaver in retirement and can provide cash for more investing when you haven't yet retired.  You might also be wishing you were an Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholder -- because, let's face it, who wouldn't want to be?","Spoiler: You'll need to buy a lot of Nvidia shares..And those shares will cost a lot..But you can get dividend income elsewhere and you might want to invest in Nvidia anyway..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.So you're looking for dividend income -- good for you! Dividend income can be a lifesaver in retirement and can provide cash for more investing when you haven't yet retired..You might also be wishing you were an Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholder -- because, let's face it, who wouldn't want to be? The semiconductor company has been on a tear in recent years, growing like gangbusters and averaging annual gains of 75% over the past five years and 51% over the past 15 years..If you're thinking maybe you can combine your quest for dividend income and for Nvidia shares, you might want to think again, though -- because while Nvidia does pay a dividend, it isn't a very big one. It's currently a penny per share per quarter, totaling $0.04 per share over the course of a year..So if you're looking for, say, $500 in annual dividend income, you'd need a lot of Nvidia shares. Divide $500 by $0.04, and you'll get 12,500 -- which is the number of shares you'd need to own to generate $500 per year in dividends. Here's the catch -- with shares recently at $142 apiece, buying 12,500 shares would cost you nearly $1.8 million. That could certainly be a terrific investment, but it's not the most efficient way to produce annual income of $500..So look elsewhere for great dividend investments, but do consider investing in Nvidia. It used to be known as a maker of gaming-chip semiconductors, but it's now a titan in the world of data center chips (often used for artificial intelligence (AI) operations and even cryptocurrency mining). It may grow via acquisitions, too..Better still, Nvidia's stock seems reasonably valued at recent levels. Its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34, for example, is below its five-year average of 40. And its recent price-to-sales ratio of 24 is close to its five-year average, though that's quite a steep level..Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This approach may expose the investor to significant losses if the company underperforms or faces negative developments such as earnings dips or management changes. Additionally, relying on dividend income for stability is another potential risk since dividends can fluctuate based on the company's performance and other external factors. The assumption that not everyone wants or needs to own Nvidia shares also introduces a consideration of individual investor preferences, which could affect investment suitability."

But that doesn't mean there aren't good values to be found. While there are some fears that a bubble will form in AI, many of the big tech stocks leading the charge look downright undervalued. In fact, some of them even fall into the classic Warren Buffett model of value investing..Buffett is known for avoiding tech stocks for most of his career, but there are some AI-related tech stocks that even a value investor like him could get behind. Keep reading for details about two of them..OpenAI may be the most buzzworthy AI company, but there's no question that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a leader in AI. The company has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for at least a decade, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, and launching Google Brain, which merged with DeepMind in 2023, before that..The company has made AI a stated priority for at least eight years, and it's kept pace with advances in generative AI with Google Gemini, its AI model, and its AI assistant that is readily available on Google Search..In addition to the company's prowess in AI technology, the stock's valuation is also attractive at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 20, meaning it trades at more than a 20% discount to the S&P 500..Investors seem to be wary of the stock because of pressure on the regulatory front and concerns that generative AI chatbots pose a threat to the dominance of Google Search..The regulatory concerns might seem valid after the company was found in court to have a monopoly in both search and ad tech, and the company is now awaiting a decision on ""remedies"" for the search business, while its remedies trial for ad tech is set for September. Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in..It's true that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity pose a threat to Google Search, but thus far, Google has held its own, continuing to grow..In fact, growth in the business has been steady, and Google Cloud has also turned profitable.

Instead, Micron makes memory and storage chips, which are becoming extremely important for processing AI workloads, not only in data centers, but also in computers and smartphones..Micron is scheduled to release its financial results for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended on May 30) on June 25, and the company's guidance suggests the report could reveal substantial growth at the top and bottom line, driven by AI. Should investors buy the stock ahead of the release?.GPUs are ideal for AI workloads because they are designed for parallel processing, meaning they can handle multiple tasks at once with a high degree of efficiency. But GPUs need memory to store data in a ready state, so it can be called upon at a moment's notice to speed up processing time..Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) for the data center is the best in the industry. In fact, Nvidia selected it to power its latest Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs, which are designed for next-generation ""reasoning"" AI models. These models require significantly more computing power and memory than traditional large language models (LLMs), because they spend more time thinking in the background to craft the most accurate responses for users..Micron expects the market for data center HBM to double to $35 billion this year, and then grow to $100 billion by 2030. The company is already completely sold out of HBM3E until 2026, and it's now working on HBM4E to stay ahead of the competition. This new solution will launch next year, and it could deliver a whopping 60% more bandwidth than its predecessor..But memory is also a critical component in computers and smartphones -- even more so now that some smaller AI workloads are designed to be processed on-device. In other words, chips are becoming powerful enough to run some AI applications (like chatbots) offline, so they don't need to lean on any computing power from external data centers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-micron-technology-stock-june-081300094.html," The risk associated with considering Micron Technology's stock before June 25th is **market sensitivity and reliance on earnings reports**. This stems from several factors:  1. **Economic Sensitivity**: Micron's business is tied to computer hardware demand, which can be volatile with economic changes affecting consumer spending.  2. **Specialized Technology Risks**: The use of HBM3E memory by Nvidia introduces potential regulatory issues or competition from other tech companies in the storage market.  3. **Sector Cyclical Nature**: The company operates in cloud and edge computing sectors, which are cyclical; a downturn could impact growth.  4. **Reliance on Single Report**: Earnings results heavily influence investor sentiment. If Micron underperforms expectations, it could lead to stock price declines.  Thus, the primary risk is the reliance on a single financial report's outcomes affecting investor confidence and potentially driving stock value downward if not met."

With its powerful parallel processing capabilities, Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the main chips used to run AI workloads. Nvidia's real moat isn't its powerful chips, however -- it's CUDA, its proprietary software platform that developers have been trained on for nearly two decades. Over time, Nvidia layered on CUDA X, a collection of AI tools and libraries that make its chips even more efficient for AI tasks..This combination of dominant hardware and sticky software helped Nvidia capture over 90% of the GPU market in the first quarter. As AI demand surged, Nvidia's data center revenue exploded, growing more than 9x in two years. That momentum shows no signs of slowing. Nvidia's new Blackwell chips are ramping faster than any product in the company's history, and demand for its full-stack AI ""factories"" continues to accelerate. In addition, it's gaining traction with automakers, offering a second potential growth engine..While a slowdown in data center spending is a risk, Nvidia remains the best way to invest in the AI infrastructure buildout..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), more commonly known as TSMC, has quietly become one of the most important companies in the world. As the go-to manufacturer for advanced AI chips, it's playing a critical role in the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia designs chips, TSMC is the one actually making them, and few other companies have its capabilities in this area..TSMC's chip manufacturing expertise is paying off.

2025-06-19 09:00:00,This Monster Artificial Intelligence (AI) Data Center Stock Is the Real Winner From Google's Deal with OpenAI (Hint: It's Not Nvidia),"Google Cloud just signed a major deal with OpenAI, and no one is talking about the who the real winner of this partnership is.","Throughout the AI revolution, OpenAI has relied heavily on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to supply compute power..In recent months, OpenAI has been seeking alternatives to Microsoft -- most recently choosing to partner with Google..Working with OpenAI is a major win for Google, but I see a data center infrastructure service provider as an even bigger winner from this deal..10 stocks we like better than CoreWeave ›.While Nvidia, Palantir Technologies, and Tesla consistently find their names in headlines regarding artificial intelligence (AI), I would argue that one company that dwarfs the attention garnered by big tech is OpenAI -- the start-up that kicked off the AI revolution in the first place..Recently, OpenAI sent shockwaves around the AI landscape yet again. This time, however, it wasn't because the ChatGPT developer released another groundbreaking product aimed at its rivals..Rather, investors learned that OpenAI is teaming up with ... Alphabet. Below, I'm going to detail why the partnership between OpenAI and Alphabet is such a big deal..Moreover, I'll break down which AI data center stock I think is poised to benefit most from this deal. Let's dig in..You may recall that when OpenAI emerged a few years ago, Microsoft was fast to partner with the company. More specifically, Microsoft plowed $10 billion into OpenAI as part of a strategic investment. One of the cornerstones of this deal was integrating ChatGPT into Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure. Throughout their partnership, OpenAI's compute infrastructure for training and inferencing was primarily supported by Microsoft. With Google entering the picture, however, those dynamics have changed..OpenAI is branching out beyond Microsoft and now leveraging the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to complement Azure for compute resources. While this is a huge win for Alphabet's cloud business -- which rivals both Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- I see an even bigger winner emerging from this partnership..While Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have been critical sources of high-performance chipsets for data centers throughout the AI revolution, a new player is emerging as a key resource in the space..CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) provides critical infrastructure services to AI developers through a cloud-based model. Companies that may not have the time or financial resources to acquire graphics processing units (GPU) from Nvidia and its peers can essentially rent them from CoreWeave's cloud-based infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monster-artificial-intelligence-ai-data-010000853.html," The news about Google Cloud partnering with OpenAI presents several risks within the financial context:  1. **Strategic Shift Risk**: The deal may lead to significant shifts in the AI market landscape, potentially disrupting existing players and causing reallocating investments as companies adapt.  2. **Concentration Risk**: If the partnership heavily relies on OpenAI's technology without full integration or value realization, there could be reliance on a specific vendor or technology, increasing vulnerability if this strategic focus is not sustained.  3. **Regulatory Impact Risk**: Changes in government policies towards AI and data centers could impose new regulations that affect the operational efficiency or profitability of these companies, introducing regulatory risk.  4. **Operational Integration Risk**: The complexity of integrating advanced AI capabilities into existing cloud services may present unforeseen technical challenges, potentially leading to delays in realizing expected benefits.  5. **Market Dynamics Competition Risk**: The competitive shift due to Google's deal could alter market dynamics, creating new opportunities or threats for companies involved in AI data centers.  While there is a potential positive risk related to increased market access and revenue streams, the primary focus here is on strategic shifts, concentration, regulatory, operational, and competitive risks."

Generative AI has driven an investment surge into data centers, which provide the infrastructure for storing, processing, and distributing data, key to running AI applications..Malaysia has garnered a significant share of this investment, attracting multibillion-dollar deals from the likes of Google, Oracle, and Microsoft over the past 18 months..And some of that hype has boosted the fortunes of some of Malaysia’s companies, including NationGate, an electronics manufacturing services provider..The company generated 5.27 billion Malaysian ringgit ($1.6 billion) in revenue last year, high enough to place it at No. 243 on the Fortune Southeast Asia 500. Even more staggeringly, the company grew its revenues by more than 720%, making it the fastest-growing company in terms of revenue on this year’s list..NationGate also earned $35 million in profits, a respectable 163% increase from the year before..The company’s data computing segment drove much of its revenue, contributing 88% this year compared with 17% in 2023. NationGate also works with the automotive and telecommunications sectors..More than half of NationGate’s revenue comes from Malaysia; another third comes from Singapore. The two countries are arguably Southeast Asia’s data center hubs..One of NationGate’s key businesses is assembling AI products. And it has a key advantage in this space as Nvidia’s only original equipment manufacturing partner in Southeast Asia. That means NationGate is the only company in the region that assembles Nvidia’s highly sought-after graphics processing units (GPUs) into AI servers. Nvidia’s GPUs are by far the most used in high-performance AI applications..NationGate sees “immense potential” in AI, and believes that its entry into AI server manufacturing will help it tap into “double digit” annual growth in data center investments in both Southeast Asia and globally..But the AI boom brings risks, too..Both Malaysia and Singapore have faced scrutiny owing to allegations that both countries are channels for controlled U.S. chips to make their way to China. In particular, U.S. officials are reportedly examining whether DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup, circumvented U.S. export control measures with the help of third parties in Singapore..In March, K Shanmugam, Singapore’s Law and Home Affairs Minister, said servers containing chips controlled under U.S. export controls appeared to have been sent to Malaysia. Following that allegation, Malaysian Trade Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz said officials were investigating and vowed to take necessary action against local companies engaging in fraud.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ai-boom-helps-malaysia-000000416.html," The analysis of the provided news article about Nvidia and Malaysia's NationGate reveals that there is no significant risk associated with the information presented. The key points considered were various types of risks such as market, regulatory, economic, competitive, reputational, and operational risks. However, the article does not indicate any specific threats or issues in these areas. Therefore, based on the given information, the risk level is deemed negligible.  **Answer:** No risk."

On the surface, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence..However, over the last couple of weeks, Tesla stock has started to witness some new life -- save for a brief sell-off following a fleeting tiff between Elon Musk and President Trump..While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback during the second half of the year..Let's explore a major update coming to Tesla soon and understand how this could fuel shares to new all-time highs. Is now the time to pounce on Tesla stock? Read on to find out..Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs. Rather, Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla..Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software. Tesla plans to leverage self-driving software across two applications: offering it as a feature in its cars and building a fleet of robotaxis for ride-hailing services..While the initial launch date for the Tesla Robotaxi was rumored to be June 12, more recent commentary from Musk himself suggests that the first rides will take place in Austin, Texas, later this month (potentially between June 22 and 28)..A successful robotaxi launch represents a transformative shift in Tesla -- from primarily a car manufacturer to more of an AI-powered services provider disrupting ride-hailing, car rentals, or logistics businesses..When it comes to popular stocks in the AI realm, I'm sure cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon come to mind. Moreover, given Nvidia's ongoing rollout of its new Blackwell GPU architecture, the semiconductor king appears well positioned for further growth, too..Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AI capital expenditures (capex) just this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-220000899.html," The news article about an AI stock being positioned for a comeback over the next six months is categorized as **moderate risk**. Here's why:  1. **Market Volatility**: The sudden surge in AI stocks could cause market volatility due to increased trading activity, potentially leading to price fluctuations.  2. **Competition from Other Technologies**: While machine learning (a subset of AI) may offer competition, the broader context includes emerging technologies like quantum computing that could overshadow AI in specific applications.  3. **Regulatory Risks**: The rise of AI brings concerns over data privacy, bias in algorithms, and job displacement. Regulatory changes or legal challenges could impact the stock negatively.  4. **Operational Risks**: Companies might face operational challenges such as talent shortages (specialized AI engineers), integration difficulties with existing systems, or supply chain issues.  5. **Market Overvaluation**: The stock may become overvalued quickly if there's a positive reaction without considering fundamental changes, potentially leading to a correction.  6. **Economic Conditions**: The overall state of the economy could affect companies regardless of AI trends, and inflationary pressures might impact performance.  7. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: A surge in demand due to increased supply could lead to unexpected market movements if fundamentals don't support rapid growth.  8. **Unexpected Events or Announcements**: Major news, positive or negative, related to AI could cause unexpected market shifts.  9. **Liquidity Issues**: A sudden rush of buying could affect liquidity and price dynamics.  10. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Impact**: While AI is expected to perform well in 2025, future outcomes depend on its actual impact beyond this period.  11. **Investor Sentiment Driven Bubbles**: Investor excitement about AI without solid fundamentals could lead to overvaluation and subsequent corrections.  Thus, while the potential for growth exists, moderate risk is appropriate due to these factors that could negatively impact the stock."

Expansion in cross-border volumes, rising digital transactions, and investments in AI and stablecoin infrastructure enhance its future prospects.A robust financial position with ample liquidity and shareholder returns further supports long-term growth. Visa shares outperformed the industry over the past year. However, the company faces rising client incentives and expenses, which may weigh slightly on margins. Regulatory pressures and potential legislative changes pose additional risks to its fee structures. While declining cash volumes align with Visa’s digital strategy, regional softness warrants monitoring. Moreover, the stock’s premium valuation suggests limited near-term upside.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Exxon Mobil’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+9.3% vs. +3.6%). The company’s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana are driving robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience.  With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. The Exxon Mobil reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings fueled by higher production from Guyana, the Permian and structural cost savings.Yet, refining profits weakened due to a significant fall in industry refining margins. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations, which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices.

This microcap company with a market capitalization of $286.69 million has a solid balance sheet — with $77.9 million in cash, no debt, and strong cash flow — and supports dividends, buybacks, and strategic investments without external funding. Florsheim’s 7% Q1 growth and traction in “refined casual” styles offset weakness in legacy brands like Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams. Retail gross margins held at 66.6%, underscoring pricing power and digital focus. A special dividend and a 4% dividend hike show a commitment to shareholder returns. Strategic inventory buildup cushions tariff risks and ensures supply continuity.However, margin pressure from steep tariffs, BOGS weakness, wholesale softness and geographic concentration pose risks. Ongoing supply chain shifts away from China are necessary, but may disrupt operations.

Nvidia stock has been on a roll over the last several weeks, and I think it could keep rising.","This year's sell-offs in Nvidia stock were primarily driven by uncertainty about what DeepSeek's AI model means for long-term GPU demand and fears over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs..The rising levels of investment in AI infrastructure globally support a compelling growth narrative for Nvidia..Nvidia stock has been on a roll over the last several weeks, and I think it could keep rising..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Megacap technology companies have been some of the biggest movers and shakers in the stock market throughout 2025. Among the hottest stocks in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), but it has been struggling this year..While the graphics processing unit (GPU) king's market capitalization peaked early this year at nearly $3.7 trillion, a months-long slide that bottomed out in April shaved about $1.4 trillion off its value..However, Nvidia stock has rebounded over the last month or so and has almost fully recovered from that decline..Let's explore what drove the sell-off in Nvidia to begin with. From there, I'll explain why investor enthusiasm for the chip designer is on the rise and detail why I think the stock is poised for an epic breakout during 2025's second half..The chart below illustrates the fluctuations in Nvidia's market cap throughout 2025. The volatility in the stock in January and February was triggered by the emergence onto the scene of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek..Initial reporting took DeepSeek management at its word when it asserted that it had developed its highly sophisticated R1 model at an incredibly low price relative to competing AI models, and had done so entirely with older Nvidia chip architectures that aren't widely used by U.S. developers anymore. This caused many onlookers to question just how essential Nvidia's most advanced GPUs would prove to be for AI development and training broadly, and whether demand for its new Blackwell series of chips would be as strong as had been projected..As more information about DeepSeek emerged, however, it became clear that the company may not have been entirely upfront about how it trained its model, or what the the real cost of doing so was..Investors came to recognize that the existence of DeepSeek might not represent a major threat to Nvidia's business after all. Yet its shares continued to slide. Why?.Well, throughout the month of March, investors were more or less guessing whether President Donald Trump would, in fact, impose heavy tariffs on America's trading partners -- something he had often promised to do while campaigning.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-losing-more-1-trillion-170800338.html," The article outlines several types of risk related to Nvidia's stock:  1. **Market Volatility**: The significant loss in market capitalization earlier in the year suggests high volatility. Market caps can fluctuate dramatically due to investor sentiment and news, leading to unpredictable price movements.  2. **Geopolitical Risks**: Tariffs imposed by President Trump could disrupt global supply chains and economies, creating uncertainty. This geopolitical instability may impact not only Nvidia but also other companies worldwide.  3. **Speculative Bubble Concerns**: Increased investment in AI infrastructure might lead to irrational exuberance or a bubble, which can result in extreme price movements that aren't justified by underlying performance.  4. **Irrational Investor Behavior**: The article mentions market sentiment being influenced by irrational behavior, such as chasing gains without thorough analysis, which can cause panic selling or buying at inappropriate times.  5. **Market Sentiment and sudden shifts**: The stock's trajectory could be highly sensitive to changing market sentiment, which may not always align with actual performance or economic fundamentals.  These risks combine to create a volatile environment for Nvidia's stock, involving both quantitative factors like market volatility and qualitative aspects such as geopolitical tensions and investor psychology."

It's now skyrocketing because generative AI needs powerful GPUs, too, and Nvidia is the leader. With nearly every large tech company in the race to release competitive AI platforms, Nvidia's business has been on fire..This growing demand is expected to continue, largely because Nvidia's products are capable and versatile. New opportunities continue to pop up in AI, including with data centers. These AI companies need tons of power for AI's computational needs, and they need data centers to manage that workload. Nvidia's revenue increased 69% year over year in the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), and data center segment revenue outpaced it, increasing 73%..The data center opportunity will keep growing along with AI. According to Fortune Business Insights, the data center market was $243 billion in 2024, and it's expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% through 2032, reaching $585 billion..This is just the beginning for AI, and Nvidia is well-positioned to tap into that high growth..Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

While analysts project that the global AI market will grow to over $2 trillion by 2030, we're still in the early stages of this technological transformation. From automating warehouse operations to revolutionizing healthcare diagnostics, AI is creating unprecedented opportunities for investors willing to look beyond the obvious chip stocks..Here are seven AI stocks positioned to deliver explosive growth as this technology reshapes the business world..Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) provides the critical observability tools that keep modern digital infrastructure running, and the AI boom is sharply accelerating demand. In Q1 2025, revenue jumped 25% year over year to $762 million, while adoption of the comany's large language model monitoring tools doubled in just six months..As AI workloads scale across industries, real-time infrastructure visibility becomes non-negotiable -- positioning Datadog as the backbone of the AI-powered enterprise stack. Despite the company's strong fundamentals, its shares are down more than 14% year to date (as of June 17, 2025), offering investors a rare entry point into a premier AI infrastructure play..Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) has grown from a secretive defense contractor into a leading force in AI-powered analytics. In Q1 2025, revenue climbed 39% year over year to $884 million, driven by a 71% surge in U.S. commercial sales to $255 million and a 45% gain in government revenue to $373 million..By combining its Foundry and AIP platforms, Palantir delivers scalable AI solutions to both public institutions and private enterprises. This gives investors rare exposure to two of the most powerful adoption curves in the AI economy..Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) is transforming the $35 billion warehouse automation market with AI-driven robotic systems. Q2 2025 revenue jumped 40% to $550 million, supported by a massive $23 billion contracted backlog.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-artificial-intelligence-stocks-could-103000103.html," The article about AI stocks presents a complex set of risks primarily rooted in the speculative nature of early-stage investments. The key risks include:  1. **Market Risk**: High volatility due to early-stage exposure and rapid market growth, leading to potential losses if performance doesn't meet expectations.  2. **Regulatory Risks**: Potential changes in government policies affecting AI adoption across various sectors, which could impact company performance.  3. **Competition Risk**: Increased competition from multiple sectors (e.g., healthcare, logistics) may lead to market saturation and adverse effects on individual companies.  4. **Operational Risks**: Reliance on technology adoption rates, with the risk that slower-than-expected growth could underperform.  5. **Overvaluation Risk**: Stocks might be overpriced based on high growth expectations, leading to potential losses upon underperformance.

2025-06-18 18:00:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be Worth $2 Trillion in 3 Years,Broadcom is seeing huge growth in its AI semiconductor division.  Broadcom's products will continue to grow with the rise of AI inference.  Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) isn't the first company that comes to investors' minds when discussing mission-critical suppliers to the AI arms race.,"Broadcom is seeing huge growth in its AI semiconductor division..Broadcom's products will continue to grow with the rise of AI inference..10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›.Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) isn't the first company that comes to investors' minds when discussing mission-critical suppliers to the AI arms race. Companies like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are often mentioned, but Broadcom hovers in the background. However, Broadcom is a formidable company primed to benefit from a massive boom from two of its AI products..Although Broadcom is a $1.2 trillion company right now, I could easily see it rising to a $2 trillion company within three years. That would easily allow it to outperform the market, which makes it a fantastic option to consider now..Broadcom isn't top of mind for many investors because it isn't laser-focused on AI. It has products sprawling from mainframe software to cybersecurity to virtual desktops (thanks to its VMware acquisition). However, many of Broadcom's AI products are critical to data center infrastructure..Broadcom's AI offerings are split into two categories: connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs. Starting with the connectivity switches, data centers have computing clusters with thousands of GPUs that constantly process AI workloads. Often, an AI prompt may require multiple GPUs to process the answer, and data centers need devices to stitch together the multi-piece answer. That's where Broadcom's connectivity switches come in, and they will only become more important as we transition into the next phase of AI..Although all AI hyperscalers are working on training better models, we're starting to see widespread usage of AI models in business and personal life. This means the AI hyperscalers must start thinking about inference, which occurs when an AI model is prompted for an answer. More inference capacity boosts the need for these connectivity switches, boosting Broadcom's sales..Another product that has Broadcom excited is its XPUs. Its custom AI accelerators are an alternative to GPUs, as they can also process multiple calculations in parallel. The difference between an XPU and a GPU is that XPUs are designed for a specific workload and don't have the flexibility of a GPU. Because these XPUs are designed in collaboration with the end user, the AI hyperscalers can tailor the processing unit to their workloads, optimizing these units for whatever workload they would like. This allows XPUs to outperform GPUs in specific use cases, but it also does something even more important for its clients.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-100000151.html," The article about Broadcom's AI semiconductor division growing to a $2 trillion valuation in three years presents several risk factors:  1. **Market Assumptions**: The prediction relies heavily on the assumption of rapid AI growth. Any failure or slower-than-expected adoption of AI technologies could undermine this projection.  2. **Competition**: The emergence of new competitors in the AI space could fragment the market, potentially reducing Broadcom's market share and growth prospects.  3. **Supply Chain Risks**: Reliance on semiconductors exposes Broadcom to supply chain disruptions, which could slow production and affect demand for their products.  4. **Economic Conditions**: Economic downturns might reduce consumer spending and investment in AI hardware, impacting growth rates.  5. **Investor Confidence**: High expectations set by the prediction could lead to significant market reactions if actual outcomes fall short of expectations.  6. **Regulatory Environment**: Changes in regulations related to AI or semiconductor production could introduce unforeseen challenges.  7. **Technological Changes**: Rapid advancements in AI could render existing technologies obsolete, affecting growth trajectories.  8. **Lack of Quantitative Support**: The article lacks concrete data supporting the $2 trillion prediction, introducing uncertainty.  These risks collectively suggest that while the growth potential is significant, several factors could impact the accuracy of the predicted valuation."

Trade-related concerns weighed down the stock a few months ago but those issues appear to be in the rearview mirror with the stock back to around its all-time highs. The company's cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) chips are crucial for many tech businesses deploying next-gen technologies and pursuing AI projects, and that has made it one of the best growth stocks to own in recent years..But with question marks still looming about what lies ahead for the global economy, is Nvidia's stock still a good buy at its current levels, or are you better off waiting for a drop in price before adding it to your portfolio?.Nvidia is the leading AI chipmaker in the world. That has allowed it to command high margins for its products, which enabled it to grow its bottom line at an incredibly fast pace. While many growth stocks are able to grow their sales at impressive rates, what stands out about Nvidia is its earnings growth, which outpaced its top line in recent years..Arguably, the stock isn't even that expensive. While its market cap may be around $3.5 trillion, it still trades at a fairly modest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33 (based on analyst estimates). Although that's not exactly cheap, it's not that expensive either, given just how dominant the business is and how quickly it has been growing. The average stock on the S&P 500 trades at 22.9 times its future earnings, and Nvidia surely doesn't fall into the category of ""average"" -- some premium is justifiable here..A risk for investors is that by waiting for a dip as Nvidia's earnings continue to grow, the stock may end up rising even if its P/E ratio doesn't increase. That's why it may not make sense to wait right now..The best argument for waiting is that with the S&P 500 back around record levels, there may be too much optimism and bullishness priced into the overall markets, and Nvidia is benefiting from that. The company still faces considerable uncertainty about trade restrictions involving one of its key markets, China. And it's not even going to include it in forecasts due to the uncertainty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-nvidia-stock-now-wait-094500077.html," The article suggests that while Nvidia's stock has reached new highs due to strong performance and market sentiment, it also presents higher volatility. This increased volatility can be interpreted as speculative risk, as the stock's recent rise may indicate it is trading near an overvalued level, posing a potential for loss if the market experiences a correction or dip.  **Answer:** Speculative Risk"

Although it's up more than 40% this year (as of June 13), its low valuation suggests that it still struggles to win back the trust of investors after having a very public falling out with its auditor last year..SoundHound AI rose to prominence last year after chipmaker Nvidia disclosed a position in the voice AI company. But with Nvidia recently selling its stake in the business and SoundHound still struggling to stay out of the red, many investors have also hit sell on this once-exiting AI stock..Which of these two stocks makes for the better option for investors looking to generate big gains from AI? Let's break down their numbers and growth opportunities to see which one is the best stock to put into your portfolio today..Supermicro provides valuable AI infrastructure that businesses need to scale their operations. It got into some trouble last year regarding its finances, including its financial auditor resigning. But the company has a new auditor and managed to meet its reporting deadlines to avoid its stock getting delisted..Over the trailing 12 months, the company generated $21.6 billion in sales, with its profits totaling $1.2 billion. Although its margins are lean, the company was able to consistently stay in the black and grow its earnings over the years..Investors discounted the stock heavily since the adversity and bad press it faced last year, and it now trades at just 13 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst estimates). This factors in the growth and earnings that analysts expect from the business in the year ahead, which suggests Supermicro could be a steal of a deal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-vs-soundhound-092000434.html," The analysis identifies several risks associated with investing in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and SoundHound AI (SOUN), both of which are considered promising in the AI sector.

Revenue rose a massive 69% year over year and was up 12% sequentially. Demand from data centers was the big driver of performance, with revenue from this customer group up 73% year over year..That level of growth is the big reason these three stocks will be great buy-and-hold investments if you want to tap into AI growth..Nvidia is performing exceptionally well as a business. But this isn't a secret, and the stock price is up over 1,400% over the past five years. Although the stock's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are reasonable when compared to their five-year averages, it would be hard to suggest that Nvidia is a cheap stock. Indeed, the P/E ratio is a lofty 45x. A lot of good news is already priced in here..The glass-half-full argument is that Nvidia has a lot of good news to offer, and there's no sign that the good news is going to stop flowing. But artificial intelligence (AI) is still a very young industry. At one point, Yahoo! looked like a category killer in search, but it was still surpassed by Alphabet's Google service. It is still early days in AI, and it remains difficult to predict which companies, from Nvidia to Palantir Technologies, will be the long-term winners..But there's one thing that is very clear: AI and the data centers in which it lives are going to increase demand for electricity by a massive amount. By the National Electrical Manufacturers Association's estimate, the increase in electricity demand will be around 300% over just the next decade. And that will lead to a step change in the demand for electricity. Demand rose by a grand total of 9% between 2000 and 2020 but is expected to increase by 55% between 2020 and 2040..AI is great, but it stops working if you turn off the power switch. And it draws a massive amount of power from the electrical grid. AI growth is going to be good for electricity providers across the board. The safest play is probably a utility like NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). This company is really two businesses in one.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-085000397.html," The news about Nvidia and AI stocks presents several types of risks that investors should consider when evaluating whether to buy and hold these stocks for a decade:  1. **Systematic Risk**: The broader market risk, which can include economic downturns, inflation, or geopolitical issues affecting all investments.  2. **Company-Specific Risks**:    - **Dependency on Technology and Infrastructure**: Reliance on factors like electricity demand and reliable networks could be disrupted by issues such as supply chain problems in semiconductors.     3. **Market Volatility**: Long-term holding involves market fluctuations due to rapid technological advancements, changing regulations, or shifts in consumer spending patterns.  4. **Geopolitical Risks**: Potential disruptions from global events like trade wars, sanctions, or geopolitical tensions that could impact energy markets and operations.  5. **Regulatory Risks**: Stricter regulations on AI, data privacy, and ethics could increase costs or limit growth opportunities for tech companies.  6. **Economic Downturns**: A recession might reduce consumer spending on technology, affecting sectors reliant on cloud computing.  7. **Technology Life Cycle Risks**: Rapid innovation necessitates continuous investment in new technologies, which can lead to challenges like product obsolescence or scaling inefficiencies.  8. **Valuation Risks**: Overvaluation in the AI sector could lead to declines if growth slows down.  In conclusion, while Nvidia's strong performance and stable electricity demand are positive indicators, investors should be aware of these risks to make informed decisions about holding long-term investments."

The company is growing fast and aggressively spending to build data centers.  One stock has crushed its returns in the last few months: CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV).,"CoreWeave is a cloud provider that just went public and is soaring..The company is growing fast and aggressively spending to build data centers..The stock is risky to buy today because of the company's heavy cash burn..10 stocks we like better than CoreWeave ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) investors love Nvidia. One stock has crushed its returns in the last few months: CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV). The stock in the AI-focused cloud computing provider (and large Nvidia customer) is up 268% since its initial public offering (IPO) in late March, while Nvidia stock is flat year to date as of June 15..Investors are falling in love with the rapid growth at CoreWeave and its huge growth projections when it comes to AI and the cloud. Are you missing out by not owning CoreWeave stock to play the AI boom?.CoreWeave stock has gone up and to the right since its initial public offering (IPO). This is common among popular IPO stocks, as they generally have a low publicly traded float -- meaning the amount of shares you can buy and sell each day -- before its lock-up period ends for insiders. A lock-up period is when insiders cannot sell shares after the IPO, and usually lasts three to six months..This led CoreWeave's stock to rise 268% in just a few months. Its revenue is growing like wildfire, up 420% year over year last quarter to $982 million. In 2025, the company expects to generate around $5 billion in revenue, which is up from basically zero in 2022. That means CoreWeave has gone from zero to $5 billion in revenue in less than five years, making it one of the fastest growing companies in market history..Why is CoreWeave growing so quickly? Because AI developers are flocking to its cloud platform to utilize its data centers for training and running AI systems. CoreWeave was built from the ground up for AI systems, which is why it now has a backlog of $25.9 billion. To be clear, it is not going to dethrone the other cloud providers, but it is increasingly nabbing share in the all-important AI growth category..Guidance calls for major growth in the future. In 2025 alone, CoreWeave is expecting to spend at least $20 billion on capital expenditures, or around 4 times its revenue estimates for the year. This means the company is laying out a huge amount of capital ahead of expected future demand as it hopes to capture more and more cloud spending related to AI..Being a global cloud provider is expensive. You have to spend billions of dollars ahead of time to build data centers, getting returns steadily in the future as your customers pay for computing capacity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stock-268-crushing-nvidias-081500816.html," The analysis of CoreWeave's stock performance reveals several key risks:  1. **Market Volatility**: The significant rise in its stock price (268% this year) raises concerns about potential instability and future volatility.  2. **Operational Risks**: The company is heavily investing in expanding data centers, which could lead to increased operational costs if not managed efficiently or if expansion proves to be less successful than anticipated.  3. **Outperformance Relative to Established Competitors**: While CoreWeave outperforms Nvidia, there's a risk that this success might not be sustainable and could potentially attract competition or regulatory scrutiny.  4. **Economic Sensitivity**: The tech sector is vulnerable to broader macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, and market trends, which could impact its performance.  5. **Supply Chain Risks**: Reliance on manufacturing and components for cloud infrastructure could lead to disruptions affecting production and costs.  6. **Regulatory Environment**: Although stable, regulatory changes in the region where CoreWeave operates could introduce unexpected challenges.  In summary, while CoreWeave's strong performance is notable, it comes with risks related to market volatility, operational expansion, potential outperformance sustainability, economic sensitivity, supply chain dependencies, and regulatory factors."

When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L).

It was the first time Taiwanese officials have used that blacklist to sanction major Chinese firms, taking a cue from a longstanding US approach of blocking access to advanced technologies..The move also marks Taipei’s first public action on semiconductor restrictions since President Lai Ching-te pledged in April to address unspecified concerns from Washington about export controls. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, people familiar with the matter said, with a particular focus on enforcement of existing curbs. They requested anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly..A congressional committee focused on China, meanwhile, said after Taipei’s move that the US “must continue working with our partners to ensure the CCP’s attempts to illegally transfer tech are stopped cold.”.Taipei’s decision may be the first of a series of measures tightening the flow of technology to China, marking a departure from a policy of nurturing cross-Strait business ties. The longer-term goal may be to throttle supply of the vital components, silicon materials and plant construction expertise that helped transform Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. into the world’s most advanced chip operation..“This recent shift marks a substantive move toward strategic technological competition with China,” said Chiang Min-yen, an analyst at Taiwan’s government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology. “Compared to other tech democracies with similar industrial structures — such as Japan and South Korea — Taiwan is now taking a more decisive stance.”.Lai didn’t specify in his April comments what steps Taiwan would take in response to US concerns, but instead described a broader strategy to boost trade relations with the US. It’s unclear whether the Huawei and SMIC sanctions are related to ongoing tariff negotiations with Washington, or whether the US requested that specific step. The US Department of Commerce, White House and Taiwan’s Office of Trade Negotiations didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-china-tech-fight-widens-021748913.html," The analysis identifies several key risks associated with Taiwan joining the US campaign against Huawei:  1. **Geopolitical Tensions**: Escalation of tensions between the US and China, which could lead to further conflicts in trade, technology, and other areas.  2. **Impact on Global Tech Supply Chains**: The blacklist could lead to sanctions and restrictions affecting other tech companies globally, disrupting supply chains and increasing costs for businesses relying on these technologies.  3. **Intellectual Property Concerns**: Potential wave of international sanctions against Chinese tech firms, undermining global innovation and economic growth.  4. **Economic Instability**: Disruption of financial systems and trade due to increased scrutiny and restrictions on technology exports could lead to economic instability and supply chain inefficiencies.  5. **Strategic Shifts**: Increased isolation of China's tech sector from the global community, potentially hindering its technological advancements and economic growth.  6. **Reaction from International Allies**: Compulsion for other nations to respond with sanctions, amplifying the impact on global markets and trade dynamics.  These risks collectively suggest a potential surge in geopolitical instability and economic challenges, with significant implications for global markets and international relations."

In fact, at its lowest, Nvidia slipped to less than $100 earlier in the year.  Technology companies in recent earnings reports say they continue to pour investment into AI, a good sign for Nvidia.","Nvidia, after falling below $100 earlier this year, now is a few dollars away from $150..The top AI company has benefited from surging AI demand, and this momentum could continue..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.The earlier part of the year wasn't easy for market superstar Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock slumped for a few reasons -- from worries about U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the Chinese market and a U.S. plan to set tariffs on imports, to concerns about technology spending. Each of these areas represents a risk for the leading AI chip designer, and that kept the stock trading well below $150. In fact, at its lowest, Nvidia slipped to less than $100 earlier in the year..But, in recent weeks, the stock has rebounded, erasing losses for the year and showing signs of renewed momentum -- and it's now just a few dollars away from $150. Though the export control issue remains, the other headwinds have eased. Technology companies in recent earnings reports say they continue to pour investment into AI, a good sign for Nvidia. As for the tariffs, President Donald Trump has signed initial agreements with the U.K. and China that offer investors optimism the duties may not dramatically impact corporate earnings..Considering all of this, should you get in on Nvidia while it's below $150?.Nvidia soared into the spotlight in recent years thanks to one wise move: the decision to focus on the AI market before everyone was talking about AI. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) originally served the gaming market, but more than a decade ago, the company saw the potential of AI and shifted focus. From that point on, ""every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence,"" CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in a 2023 interview..This has been a winning bet for Nvidia because in recent years, data center revenue -- which encompasses AI products and services -- has skyrocketed. In the latest fiscal year, revenue surged in the triple digits to a record $130 billion. But Nvidia isn't only growing revenue. The company also has significantly increased net income thanks to its high profitability on sales -- gross margin has surpassed 70% in recent quarters, and Nvidia aims for that to continue. (In the most recent quarter, Nvidia booked a charge for lost sales in China linked to export restrictions, pushing gross margin to about 60% -- but excluding this, the margin figure once again surpassed 70%.).Speaking of China, this is one area that investors have worried about, since the region did account for 13% of sales as recently as last year. But it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia generates the lion's share of its revenue from U.S. customers, so even though the China situation may weigh on growth, it's unlikely to considerably slow down this AI giant. Last year, Nvidia brought in more than $61 billion in revenue from the U.S., and demand continues to grow as more and more customers seek computing power for AI inference -- an area of expertise for Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture and chip.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-nvidia-while-below-150-001000191.html," The article ""Should You Buy Nvidia While It's Below $150?"" suggests a risk primarily related to market volatility during earnings season. The potential for sudden stock price increases due to better-than-expected earnings reports from tech companies, including Nvidia, could impact the advice given. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding the future of AI investment, competition, and other factors may affect Nvidia's stock price beyond current positive trends. Without further details on the company's fundamentals or specific reasons for the stock decline, these broader market and competitive considerations introduce risk in deciding to buy at the suggested levels."

The key considerations include:  1. **Market Reaction Risk**: While positive sentiment may drive stock performance initially, it can lead to overvaluation later if market reactions become unpredictable or if the stock experiences volatility.  2. **Potential for Underperformance**: Even with a higher price target, NVIDIA's future performance might not meet expectations, leading to a correction in the stock price despite positive outlooks.  3. **Citi's Investment Bias**: Citi's rating could be influenced by internal biases or market trends that aren't detailed, which could affect the stock's trajectory beyond the news.  In summary, while there's no direct negative risk mentioned, the potential for overreaction and underperformance, coupled with possible biases from analysts, introduces risks to consider."

Quantum Computing (QUBT) shares are up more than 56% in the past month, and others in the space have also ripped higher..""The commonalities are they're speculative,"" Interactive Brokers chief markets strategist Steve Sosnick said in an interview. ""They're momentum-driven, and they almost always have some sort of tech veneer to them."".With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) back near record highs, the common pillars of the current three-year bull market have clearly returned in markets. Two of the most popular AI trades, Palantir (PLTR) and Nvidia (NVDA), are back to trading near all-time highs..""It's kind of a freight train,"" Sosnick said. ""Remember one of the great adages, 'the trend is your friend'? Well, people seem to be doing very well by following trends."".The momentum trade isn't a new phenomenon and has reappeared time and again during the S&P 500's nearly 70% run since the October 2022 lows. But it's the latest in a string of signs that market sentiment has recovered significantly from the height of April's tariff turmoil..In Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 66% of investors said they believe the global economy will achieve a ""soft landing,"" in which inflation falls to the Fed's 2% target without an outright downturn in economic activity. The eight-month high among respondents believing a soft landing is in sight comes as recession probabilities have tumbled over the past month, while consumers' worst fears about a tariff-driven inflation spike have also subsided..BofA's global chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote that the survey showed ""investor sentiment back to pre-Liberation Day 'Goldilocks bull' levels."".But as is often the case when consensus begins to swing heavily in one direction, some believe the current market leadership could be ripe for change..In a note to clients on Monday, Julian Emanuel argued for investors to seek ""valor in valuation"" as the summer approaches, with investors closely watching for updates on Trump's tariffs and whether or not they could disrupt economic growth..Emanuel pointed out that the ""attractive valuation"" factor, including stocks like Verizon (VZ) and Tyson Foods (TSN), has lagged the ""expensive"" factor, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), DraftKings (DKNG), Tesla (TSLA), and Strategy (MSTR).

Quantum computing stocks keep turning heads with surging gains..It’s been a crazy few months for the quantum computing space, to say the least. Earlier this year, skeptics, including Mad Money's Jim Cramer, called out the “gamification” of quantum stocks, brushing off the rallies as short-lived hype..💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵.Subsequently, we saw many pure-play names that 10x’d in late 2024 and early 2025, cooling off sharply..Still, the bullishness around the industry held up well. In recent weeks, though, the sentiment has shifted sharply, with fresh interest from lawmakers and tech leaders..Between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang changing his tune on quantum and a flurry of legislative moves in Washington, the signs suggest that it's not just theory anymore..Hence, the vibe’s now mostly bullish, and the business specifics are starting to matter a lot more. Case in point? One eponymous quantum player quietly crushing it, without obsessing over qubits or cryogenics..Quantum computing has been one of the hottest investing trends over the past year—and for good reason..Related: 5 quantum computing stocks investors are targeting in 2025.In late 2019, Google’s Sycamore processors stunned us all by achieving “quantum supremacy,” solving a task in minutes that would have taken classical supercomputers millennia..Then, it took things up a notch or two again late last year, showing its Willow chip with 105 qubits and below-threshold error correction. That chip nailed a Random Circuit Sampling task in under five minutes, a feat today’s fastest supercomputers wouldn’t crack in 10²⁵ years..Since then, multiple pure-play businesses in the niche have sprung up, vying for a lucrative bellwether position. Companies like Rigetti have taken qubit counts (a core building block of quantum tech) into the hundreds. Similarly, firms like D-Wave have commercialized quantum annealing systems for optimization tasks, with their share prices going parabolic..A big part of the sentiment shift is the much-hyped quantum-AI marriage. Earlier this month, we saw Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hailing quantum computing as the next “inflection point”. Also, he talked up the potential of quantum processors in AI workflows to speed up machine-learning training and complex simulations..Unsurprisingly, the sector’s expected to rake in serious moolah.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-computing-stock-price-slips-190406260.html," The risk analysis of the article indicates that the primary risks are associated with market sentiment, operational challenges, and potential reputational damage.   1. **Market Risk**: The decline in stock price suggests concerns within the financial markets or investor sentiment towards quantum computing companies. This could impact broader market perception of the industry.  2. **Operational Risk**: The company's internal performance issues might stem from factors like delays, reduced demand, or increased competition, affecting its ability to sustain growth and remain competitive.  3. **Reputational Risk**: A significant stock price drop can erode investor confidence, potentially harming the company's brand and future business prospects.  4. **Investor Cautions**: The downward trend might lead investors to become more risk-averse towards quantum computing stocks, affecting the company's ability to attract future investment or partnerships.  Overall, these factors suggest a multifaceted risk profile centered on investor sentiment and internal operational issues."

Huawei will have China covered, he said, suggesting controls could accelerate China's self-sufficiency in semiconductors and AI..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA..The warning comes amid U.S.China trade tensions. Tariffs on Chinese imports reached elevated levels before easing to around 55% after recent agreements. These measures have drawn retaliation from Beijing and weigh on the U.S. economy..The World Bank now expects U.S. growth to slow to about 1.4% in 2025, and the OECD has trimmed its outlook for major economies as trade frictions persist. Consumers may face higher costs due to tariffs..Huang noted that export curbs could reduce Nvidia's revenue from China, limiting funding for research and development and potentially affecting its competitive edge over rivals..As U.S. policy seeks to balance national security with economic interests, his remarks highlight the unintended risk of accelerating competitors' capabilities while sidelining American firms in a key market..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-sounds-alarm-export-curbs-180215039.html," The news about Nvidia and Huawei's interaction under U.S.-China trade dynamics involves several key risks:  1. **Geopolitical Risk**: The imposition of export curbs introduces geopolitical tensions, potentially affecting global supply chains and trade relations.  2. **Market Competition**: The potential backfire of U.S. trade policies could lead to increased competition between tech companies like Nvidia and Huawei, impacting innovation and market stability.  3. **Economic Uncertainty**: The strategic decisions by the U.S. could disrupt production lines and affect various industries reliant on exports from either country.  4. **Strategic Decisions Impact**: Both companies' responses to trade policies may lead to broader economic consequences, including shifts in market dynamics and supply chain disruptions.  In summary, the primary risks are geopolitical tensions, increased competition, economic uncertainty, and potential strategic impacts on global markets."

Stocks are rallying, and the founder, CEO, and chief investment officer of the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is at her best when high-beta stocks are moving higher. She kicked off the week by purchasing four different stocks. I want to talk about three of them..Wood added to existing stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH), and Nextdoor Holdings (NYSE: KIND) on Monday. Let's take a closer look at Wood's latest purchases..Every starting line tells a different story when it comes to the developer of graphics processing units and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Thankfully for investors, nearly all of them end in success. Nvidia is a 15-bagger over the past five years, an 8-bagger over three years, and the shares have soared 67% since bottoming out two months ago..Zoom out a bit from the last starting line and the returns start to look more mortal. Nvidia is up a pedestrian 10% over the past year with a mere 8% year-to-date advance. It's probably still a relative victory for the ""Magnificent Seven"" stock that's also the country's second most valuable publicly traded company by market cap..Nvidia and other stocks riding high on the demand for AI chips and data center buildouts have had a couple of hits this year. The first blow came in January when Chinese AI tech start-up DeepSeek announced that it was generating quality generative AI with dated Nvidia chips for a lot less than Western rivals. That was followed by the trade war that restricted the sale of chips into China, resulting in billions in charges -- and rising -- for Nvidia..This doesn't mean that Nvidia stock has been rising while its fundamentals are shifting to reverse. Revenue soared 69% to $44.1 billion in last month's quarterly update, better than the 65% jump that investors were expecting for the fiscal first quarter. A 73% surge in data center revenue -- now accounting for more than 88% of the period's top line -- led the way. Adjusted earnings increased 57% to $0.96 per share, also exceeding market forecasts..Its outlook for the current quarter includes an $8 billion revenue hit on the recent export control limitations between the U.S. and China. However, analysts still would go on to jack up their profit targets for this fiscal year as well as fiscal 2027. Despite the stock's run over the last two months, Nvidia is trading for 34 times this year's projected earnings and 25 times next year's mark. This is a discount to its growth rate, even if the pace will inevitably slow in the coming quarters. Investors fortunate enough to grab some shares at the April low got in at what is now just 15 times next fiscal year's profit target.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-goes-bargain-hunting-151700603.html," Cathie Wood's recent investments in a ""Mag 7"" stock and two ""door"" stocks involve several key risks:  1. **Concentration Risk**: By investing heavily in three high-growth stocks, there is a higher likelihood of underperformance if any of these companies face unexpected challenges.  2. **Sector Vulnerabilities**: The stocks may be from sectors prone to economic fluctuations, such as tech, which can be sensitive to interest rate changes and market downturns.  3. **Operational Risks**: High-growth companies might not scale efficiently without proper safeguards, potentially leading to inefficiencies or quality issues.  4. **Regulatory Changes**: New regulations could impact these companies' operations, affecting profitability and stock valuations.  5. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Tech stocks may be sensitive to rising interest rates due to debt financing costs, which could affect their performance.  6. **Liquidity Issues**: If the secondary market lacks buyers, selling positions quickly might lead to significant losses.  7. **Regulatory and Market Volatility**: Changes in tax laws or environmental regulations, along with broader market volatility, pose additional risks.  8. **Potential for泡沫(photodissociation)**: High-growth stocks are often overvalued based on future earnings potential, which could lead to a market crash if their performance doesn't meet expectations.  In summary, while Cathie Wood's investments offer high growth potential, they come with significant risks that could impact returns or cause losses."

Launched on June 4, IVES is an actively managed ETF focused purely on artificial intelligence companies. The rapid inflows highlight increased demand for AI exposure..IVES seeks to capitalize on the rapid growth of artificial intelligence by investing in companies poised to lead the AI transformation. This fund offers investors exposure to a diversified portfolio of firms at the cutting edge of AI technology. The Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF tracks the Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index.The ETF is well diversified across 30 stocks, with each firm making up for no more than a 5.7% share. Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA and Broadcom AVGO are the top three holdings in the fund’s basket. Further, IVES offers diversified exposure across key AI segments — semiconductors, hyperscalers, cybersecurity, cloud, robotics, and consumer platforms — reflecting a multi-trillion dollar AI investment boom (read: ETFs Poised to Win in the MSFT vs. NVDA Market Cap Battle).The new ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%, higher than large-cap tech ETFs like QQQ (0.20%) but reasonable for a thematic strategy..Wedbush’s entry into the ETF market comes at an opportune moment when AI enthusiasm has renewed among investors after a slowdown early in the year. AI-related stocks, especially NVIDIA, Microsoft and Tesla (TSLA), have been on a strong rally in recent weeks, with some up about 20% in the past month..Unlike most thematic ETFs that rely heavily on passive screens or rules-based criteria, IVES is built on the active insights of veteran tech analyst Dan Ives, Wedbush’s Managing Director and Head of Technology Research. The ETF’s portfolio is based on Ives' proprietary “AI 30” list — a curated basket of companies he believes are best positioned to lead and benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution (read: Investing in the AI Revolution with Dan Ives)..Many AI ETFs focus primarily on one segment of the AI value chain — often just big-cap platform companies like NVIDIA or Alphabet. IVES, however, adopts a comprehensive strategy that captures the entire AI ecosystem..IVES deliberately limits concentration risk. The fund caps individual holdings at relatively balanced weights, with each holding around 5% to 6%. This strategy ensures that returns are not overly reliant on just a handful of stocks. It gives smaller, high-growth companies meaningful representation while still maintaining exposure to established leaders. The result is a more diversified and potentially resilient portfolio, especially important in the volatile world of tech investing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dan-ives-ai-etf-tops-150000279.html," The news of Dan Ives' AI ETF reaching $100 million in AUM within five days highlights a significant investor interest but also introduces several underlying risks. These include potential volatility due to increased institutional investment, regulatory scrutiny for AI-related investments, dependency on emerging technology which could face evolving challenges, and the possibility of market correction if future performance doesn't sustain. Additionally, there's a risk of increased costs associated with managing higher AUM. Overall, while the initial positive trend suggests strong demand, these factors contribute to potential risks that need monitoring.  **Risk Type:** Moderate Risk"

Here’s how your $10,000 would have grown over the last 10 years had you harvested your dividends as income..Check Out: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell.June 11, 2015 share price: 53 cents, according to Macrotrends.June 11, 2025 share price: $142.83, according to Macrotrends.Returns: 26,849.06%.10-year ROI excluding dividends: $2,684,906.Reinvesting dividends can magnify gains exponentially. However, calculating long-term gains with a DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) is more complex and inexact because dividend yields fluctuate over time, which affects the number of shares that can be purchased with each reinvestment, as does the stock’s always-changing purchase price at the time of the reinvestment. Also, growing companies often issue stock splits, which change the number and value of a given investor’s shares. Therefore, the calculation must rely on averages and close estimates..Initial purchase: 18,868 shares.Stock splits since 2015: 4:1 in 2021 (75,472 shares) and 10:1 in 2024 (754,717 shares), per CompaniesMarketCap.Approximate average dividend yield over 10 years: 0.25%, according to Macrotrends.Approximate number of shares after 10 years: 852,557.Approximate ROI with dividend reinvestment at June 11 trading price: $121,770,716.Here’s how your $10,000 would have grown if you invested it in the land-holding company Texas Pacific in 2015. This calculation is even more complex than NVDA because TPL issued several flat-rate “special” dividends over the last 10 years on top of the standard yield, according to Seeking Alpha.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invested-10k-3-dividend-stocks-145237135.html," The article presents an optimistic scenario where $10K invested in three dividend stocks 10 years ago has grown to a million dollars. However, upon thorough analysis, several risks are identified:  1. **Market Volatility**: Dividend stocks can experience fluctuations due to company-specific issues or market conditions.  2. **Inflation Impact**: The article assumes that dividends keep pace with inflation, which may not always hold true, affecting purchasing power.  3. **Interest Rate Changes**: Fluctuations in interest rates can impact the value of dividends received over time.  4. **Tax Implications**: Dividends are taxable and could be subject to different tax rates depending on their classification, potentially reducing returns.  5. **Liquidity Concerns**: Selling stocks quickly might not yield optimal results due to market conditions affecting prices.  6. **Company-Specific Risks**: Companies may face issues like high debt or poor performance that aren't mentioned in the article.  Given these factors, despite the attractive narrative of significant growth, the investments carry substantial risks. Therefore, this scenario is classified as a **high-risk situation** due to the potential for losses and other unforeseen challenges."

In summary, while Astera Labs' expansion is positive, potential risks include dependency on demand trends, regulatory changes, geopolitical issues, operational complexities, funding needs, increased competition, and economic shifts."

According to some metrics, Nvidia shares remain surprisingly cheap.","The chipmaker's shares may look quite expensive at first glance..However, rapid growth and high profitability justify the premium..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have been very happy in recent years. Since 2020, shares have increased in value by roughly 1,500%. That meteoric rise has been fueled by the AI revolution. With a leading market share for AI GPUs, Nvidia has become one of the market's favorite AI stocks..Think it's too late to profit? Think again. According to some metrics, Nvidia shares remain surprisingly cheap..With a $3.5 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia stock looks expensive according to its price-to-sales ratio. Shares currently trade at 24 times sales -- a premium multiple for such a large business. But on an earnings basis, the situation changes. Shares trade at 46 times trailing earnings. That's still a notable premium, but given that the company is growing sales by more than 50% annually, the stock trades at 33 times next year's earnings..NVDA Revenue Growth Estimate for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.After factoring in a few years of rapid growth, Nvidia's stock actually starts to look fairly cheap, especially if it can maintain annual growth rates in the heavy double digits. The artificial intelligence market -- Nvidia's fastest-growing end market -- is expected to grow by more than 30% annually over the next decade. So sustained high growth rates could very well be possible..There are some risks to be concerned about going forward. Nvidia currently has a 90% market share for GPUs designed for artificial intelligence purposes. Competition will be heavy in the years to come, potentially slowing revenue growth. Plus, the company boasts the highest gross margins in the industry. Increased competition could hurt pricing, leading to lower profits and a disconnect between sales and earnings growth..Still, Nvidia stock isn't nearly as expensive as it first appears.

As of right now, Meta has generated a year-to-date return of 16.7%, beating out all other Magnificent Seven stocks. Only one other stock -- Microsoft -- boasts a double-digit gain so far this year. Nvidia, the hottest stock of the last five years, has only generated a return of 6% as of this writing..So, is Meta now the best AI stock around? Let's take a closer look..First, let's get one thing clear: Meta spent big on AI. We're talking tens of billions of dollars, with tens of billions more to come over the next few years. The company spent lavishly on the metaverse, but also on AI infrastructure and data centers..Of course, simply spending money doesn't guarantee a return. However, Meta's AI spending now appears far more focused than it did in years past. Specifically, the company has a plan to fully automate ad creation and placement across its suite of platforms such as Facebook and Instagram by 2026..This could represent a revolution in how ads are created and how ad campaigns are run. In theory, Meta could cut out ad agency middlemen that charge lavish fees before an ad ever reaches a customer. Furthermore, Meta could use its enormous trove of user data to personalize ads, potentially increasing the return on investment for ad buyers. .In addition to its AI-powered ads strategy, Meta has other bullish catalysts on its side. Take its Threads product, which competes with X (formerly known as Twitter). Meta's Threads is now attracting 320 million to 350 million monthly active users (MAUs). That's up from about 150 million a year ago..Combine Meta's AI initiatives with the growth of Threads and the company's excellent first-quarter results, and Wall Street is turning even more bullish on shares of Meta. .Analysts from major firms, including Bank of America and RBC raised their price targets for Meta's stock recently.

Nvidia's highly concentrated revenue base could pose a risk for investors in the future, but AI data center spending still has room to grow.","Nvidia supplies the most sought-after data center chips in the world for artificial intelligence (AI) development..The majority of Nvidia's revenue now comes from its data center business, but its future success rests on just a handful of key customers..Nvidia's highly concentrated revenue base could pose a risk for investors in the future, but AI data center spending still has room to grow..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Most artificial intelligence (AI) models are trained and then deployed in data centers, which are filled with thousands of specialized chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). Most AI developers don't have the financial resources to build that infrastructure themselves, but they can rent it from a handful of technology giants that operate hundreds of centralized data centers all over the world..Those tech giants typically buy most of their GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which supplies the best AI hardware in the industry. The chipmaker continues to experience more demand than it can fill, which is driving a surge in its revenue and earnings. In fact, Nvidia has added a staggering $3 trillion to its market capitalization since the beginning of 2023, and it's now the second most valuable company in the world..However, the fact that only a handful of companies can afford to build the best AI infrastructure isn't a good thing for Nvidia. During the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), more than half of the company's total revenue came from just four unnamed customers, which means a pullback in AI infrastructure spending from any one of them could threaten the chip giant's incredible run of growth..Let's take a look at who those top customers might be, so we can assess the sustainability of Nvidia's data center business..Nvidia generated $44.1 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2026 first quarter. The data center segment was responsible for $39.1 billion of that figure, so AI GPUs are now the company's most important product by far..While Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, it does report some data on the concentration of its revenue base. During the first quarter, just four mystery customers alone accounted for 54% of the company's $44.1 billion in sales:.Customer.Proportion of Nvidia's Q1 Revenue.Customer A.16%.Customer B.14%.Customer C.13%.Customer D.11%.Data source: Nvidia..That means Customer A spent around $7 billion with Nvidia during the first quarter, and there are only a handful of companies in the world with enough financial resources to keep that up. As I mentioned earlier, this creates a risk for Nvidia because if Customer A were to reduce its capital expenditures, it would be very hard for the chipmaker to replace that revenue.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/54-nvidias-q1-revenue-came-093700382.html," The analysis of the news article suggests that the primary risk involved is **concentration risk**. This arises from Nvidia's revenue dependence on a small number of key customers, with 54% of their Q1 revenue coming from just four mystery clients. Such concentration makes the company vulnerable to fluctuations in these critical customers' performance or market conditions affecting them, potentially leading to financial instability.  **Answer:** The risk classified is concentration risk due to high reliance on a few customers."

As the world's top AI chip designer, it's generated record revenue -- surpassing $130 billion in the latest fiscal year -- and investors have piled into this exciting growth story..Now, though, as Nvidia's quarterly revenue has transitioned to double-digit growth from triple-digit, investors have been wondering if the stock will keep up its momentum. On top of that, the company faces one key challenge at the moment: U.S. controls on chip exports to China, a significant market for Nvidia..Still, the global AI market has bright days ahead, with analysts forecasting a compound annual growth rate in the double-digits to reach more than $2 trillion over the next several years. Nvidia, as the chip leader, is perfectly positioned to benefit in this environment. Does that make Nvidia your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Let's find out..First, let's take a glance into the past and catch up on the fast-paced Nvidia story so far. This company, founded more than 30 years ago by current chief Jensen Huang, in its early days served the gaming market with its graphics processing units (GPUs). These powerful chips, with the ability to simultaneously process many tasks, soon emerged as a great tool for other industries. And in recent years, they showed their strengths in AI -- and became the key to developing powerful large language models in a highly efficient manner..All of this has translated into revenue growth for the company and a high level of profitability on sales, with gross margin exceeding 70% quarter after quarter..As mentioned, what's disturbed this high-growth story in recent times has been concerns about Nvidia's future in China. The U.S. a few years ago established export controls on GPUs to be shipped to China and most recently even halted sales of the GPUs Nvidia designed specifically with these controls in mind. Another concern over the past several weeks is the U.S. plan to establish import tariffs. Right now, electronics are generally excluded, but the Trump Administration says a tariff plan for these items is on the way.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-ticket-becoming-millionaire-082000759.html," The article discusses NVIDIA as a high-growth investment opportunity but also highlights potential risks:  1. **Export Controls with China**: The text mentions export controls, which pose an external risk to NVIDIA's revenue growth. Changes in trade policies or relations could affect their market presence and profitability.  2. **AI Market Volatility**: While the AI sector is booming, it can experience downturns due to cyclical market trends. A slowdown here could impact NVIDIA's growth and stock performance.  These risks are external factors that investors should consider when evaluating NVIDIA as an investment."

In a whitepaper titled ""AI Verticalization for Telcos,"" Amdocs presents an outline for telco-grade agents that are skilled, brand-engineered, trustworthy, and autonomous-capable of transforming how CSPs engage with customers and operate their networks..While the telecom sector has embraced generative AI at pace, many deployments fall short of true operational integration. This whitepaper defines a Telco-Grade Agent as one that is ""verticalized""-deeply embedded with telco-specific skills, ontologies, and reasoning capabilities. These agents go beyond surface-level interactions, delivering network-aware, context-sensitive responses and executing intelligent decision-making rooted in domain expertise..""In the age of AI, the difference between automation and intelligence lies in specialization,"" said Anthony Goonetilleke, Group President of Technology and Head of Strategy at Amdocs. ""Telco-grade agents aren't just smart-they're industry-native. They speak the language of networks, services, and customers, and they act with purpose. This framework ensures that CSPs don't just implement AI-they implement it right."".Key aspects of a telco-specific AI agent include:.Ontology is the Backbone of Telco Intelligence.For AI agents to operate effectively in the telecommunications industry, they must understand the language, logic, and structure of telco systems. That's where ontology - a formal representation of domain knowledge that enables consistent data interpretation across platforms and tasks - becomes necessary.

Today, a Wall Street analyst wrote his positive conclusion on the event, and revealed some positive industry data in the PC space, too..Last week's big event centered on AMD's new Instinct MI350 accelerators, and upcoming MI400 ""Helios"" racks, which will be available next year. But one sell-side analyst also sees some optimistic signs in AMD's client business, which led to a price target bump today..On Monday, Piper Sandler semiconductor analyst Harsh Kumar noted he is seeing some ""pull-ins"" in the client space, which used to be AMD's largest, but is now its second largest after data centers. The PC has been mired in somewhat of a downturn for a few years now, but a combination of aging pandemic-era PCs, new AI PC capabilities, pull-ins ahead of potential further tariffs, and the coming phaseout of the Windows 10 operating system may be spurring a nice refresh cycle..In addition, some investors were worried about the sequential decrease in AMD's data center and GPU revenue last quarter, where AMD hopes to compete more effectively against Nvidia. However, in the note today, Kumar also noted he sees a ""snap-back"" in that area, in the second half of the year, based on the new Instinct MI350 chips, which will be available in the second half of 2025, and ""Helios"" rack-scale systems, which will become available in the latter part of 2025..As a result, Kumar raised his price target on AMD to $140, up from $125..There are a lot of questions surrounding AMD at this moment, namely whether there is a place for its Instinct AI accelerators in the AI world where Nvidia currently dominates, and large cloud companies are all now building more custom AI silicon themselves..However, it appears as though last week's product even was encouraging on that front, and that AMD's AI design progress and acquisitions are beginning to garner enthusiasm among the analyst community.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-advanced-micro-devices-rallied-183953518.html," The news article discusses AMD receiving a positive Wall Street analyst price target and the introduction of new AI GPUs. While these developments are favorable, they do not indicate any specific risks. Therefore, the classification is:  **No risk**  Explanation: The information provided highlights positive developments for AMD without mentioning any negative factors or risks. Thus, there's no identified risk category in this context."

The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking..Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:.Buffer or defined outcome ETFs.Leveraged or inverse single-stock ETFs.Option-based income ETFs.Some of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs..This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts..Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy Works.YieldMax currently offers more than 50 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of about $14 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market..According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap..These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income..To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spreads to further enhance yields..The YieldMax Reddit community has around 50,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income..The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums—and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-yield-etfs-big-payouts-172100177.html," The analysis of high-yield ETFs using a covered-call single-stock strategy reveals several key risks:  1. **Market Volatility Risk**: The strategy carries unlimited potential losses if the ETF's price plummets due to market volatility or poor performance.  2. **Leverage and Margin Calls**: By requiring margin, investors can experience amplified gains and losses. A margin call could force selling at unfavorable prices, increasing losses.  3. **Counterparty Risk**: There is a risk of default by the broker-dealer or exchange, leading to loss of premium income if not fulfilled.  4. **Regulatory Changes**: Market conditions may alter regulations affecting strategy management, impacting performance.  5. **Tax Implications**: The taxable nature of covered-call income requires consideration of tax situations.  6. **Time Decay (Theta Risk)**: Options lose value over time, potentially eroding profits without price changes.  In conclusion, while this strategy offers convenience and regular income, it involves significant risks that should be carefully assessed by investors."

Last week, Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, whose leader is joining a team being assembled by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to pursue artificial general intelligence. That came just after Meta raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as much as $72 billion..“The amount of spending might give some pause, but we’re confident Meta can use AI to drive revenue and accelerate growth,” said Jake Seltz, who manages the Allspring LT Large Growth ETF. “This shows Meta is committed to making the investments it needs to maintain its leadership, and while the stock has had a nice run, we’re still bullish on the long-term opportunity.”.Shares rose 2.6% on Monday. Earlier, the company said it would begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service..Meta’s rally has coincided with a resurgence in trader appetites for AI-related stocks, after the earnings season alleviated fears that Big Tech companies might rein in spending on expensive computing gear. The rebound marks a shift from earlier in the year, when stocks such as Nvidia Corp. tumbled on concerns about AI models developed on the cheap in China..An exchange traded fund that tracks AI stocks including Amazon.com Inc. is up 32% from a low on April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on trading partners, sparking a broad relief rally in stocks. Over that period, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which have gained about 20% and 27%, respectively, as of their last close..Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, bought Meta shares for the first time in recent weeks, in part because of the company’s aggressive spending on AI. He also cited improved operational efficiencies and the shift away from the so-called metaverse, which prompted the company to change its name from Facebook in 2021..“Using AI to optimize the data it has on users for revenue is a clear application, one that allows Meta to play offense while Alphabet is playing defense,” Bond said, referring to concerns that the Google parent could lose market share in the lucrative search business to AI services like ChatGPT. “While AI is expensive, there is good evidence that it is really paying off so far.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-cheer-zuckerberg-doubles-101644156.html," The news about Meta Platforms Inc. doubling down on its AI strategy presents several key risks:  1. **Financial Risk**: Continued significant investment without clear performance outcomes could lead to financial losses if returns do not meet expectations.  2. **Market Competition Risk**: Intense competition from other tech companies investing in AI may threaten Meta's market position, affecting revenue and profits.  3. **Regulatory Scrutiny Risk**: Potential regulatory changes or increased oversight could impact how Meta operates, particularly concerning data privacy and algorithmic bias.  4. **User Trust Risk**: If AI performance fails to meet expectations, it could erode user trust, leading to decreased engagement and market share loss.  5. **Technological Disruption Risk**: Emerging technologies might surpass Meta's AI capabilities, causing a shift in market dynamics and potential obsolescence of its strategies.  These risks highlight the need for careful monitoring of Meta's strategic investments in AI."

Among the biggest winners were Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms..Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are considered the industry gold standard for generative AI hardware, and cloud hyperscalers and others in big tech just couldn't stop buying these pricey chipsets. While GPUs are still very much in demand, I think a new chapter is quietly unfolding within the broader AI storyline..Let's explore why the AI opportunity is more than just chips. From there, I'll go into detail about why I see Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) as a breakout candidate to lead the next bull market..When the AI revolution kicked off about two-and-a-half years ago, Nvidia was the default option when it came to purchasing GPUs. But over the last couple of years, competition has started to creep into the semiconductor market..Advanced Micro Devices is Nvidia's most direct rival in the AI data center market. However, all the cloud hyperscalers that I referenced above are also investing heavily into custom silicon in an effort to migrate from an AI architecture that's entirely built on Nvidia's backbone..In my view, GPUs aren't becoming less important by any means. However, with the introduction of so many new chips, I do think the semiconductor landscape is becoming commoditized. At this point, AI developers know that they need to keep buying chips. I think the bigger use case for these companies is becoming rooted in figuring out how to manage these GPU clusters amid ongoing AI infrastructure buildouts..This is where Oracle identified an opportunity early on, and the company's results are starting to show a clear pattern..On June 11, Oracle reported earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full 2025 year (ended May 31). For the year, Oracle generated $57.4 billion in revenue -- an increase of 8% year over year. I understand that this growth rate pales in comparison to Nvidia and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-133000808.html," The news about an AI stock leading the next tech bull market presents several risks that investors should consider:  1. **Market Risk**: The potential for significant price fluctuations due to changing market conditions.  2. **Credit Risk**: Possible financial distress if the company encounters issues like insufficient funding or production snags.  3. **Liquidity Risk**: Difficulty in quickly selling shares if there is low demand, especially during crises.  4. **Operational Risk**: Risks such as supply chain disruptions, technical failures, and process inefficiencies that could hinder growth.  5. **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in regulations affecting AI technologies, which could impact the company's profitability.  6. **Macroeconomic Risk**: Economic factors like interest rates and inflation that could affect overall market performance.  7. **Reputation Risk**: Negative publicity potentially damaging investor confidence.  Categorizing this as a high-risk investment due to these multiple layers of potential adverse outcomes makes it crucial for investors to carefully assess each risk factor before making decisions."

The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 8.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $1.00 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2%..The consensus earnings estimate of $4.25 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +42.1%.

And the company is growing quickly, with sales rising 39% to $884 million and adjusted earnings increasing 63% to $0.13 per share in the first quarter..That second figure is especially notable because many AI start-ups aren't profitable, making Palantir an exception among many of its peers. Its success has helped propel the company's share price to dizzying heights, gaining nearly 500% over the past year. But this rapid rise means that its stock is now extremely expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 574..Paying such a high premium typically isn't a wise decision. So, here are two other AI companies that are leaders as well, at a much lower premium..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) doesn't need an introduction for anyone who follows the tech sector closely, but it's worth highlighting some of the strengths of the company to show just how dominant it is in AI. Here are a few highlights:.Its AI accelerators are in an estimated 70% to 95% of the world's AI data centers..The company's data center revenue spiked 73% in the first quarter to $39 billion and adjusted earnings rose 33% to $0.81 per share in the first quarter..Even with all of its growth, CEO Jensen Huang said that ""Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong."".Its financial performance remains very strong, and the company has little competition in AI data center processors. While there have been some rumblings of tech companies backing away from spending in this category, a slowdown has yet to happen..Data center spending will reach $1.1 trillion in 2029, double what companies were spending last year, according to the analysis website Network World..It's worth noting that Nvidia's stock has a P/E of 46, which means it's not necessarily cheap. Still, it's far less pricey than Palantir, and the company arguably has a much bigger competitive moat in AI than Palantir does..It's easy to overlook Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) because it has seemingly been around forever. But while younger AI companies may attract a lot of attention, Microsoft is already benefiting from AI and continues to be a leading player in cloud computing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-palantir-buy-2-tech-124500749.html," The article discusses three tech stocks—Palantir, Nvidia, and Microsoft—and highlights their respective strengths in the AI sector. However, there are several underlying risks associated with investing in these companies:  1. **Palantir**:     - **Risk of泡沫**: The rich valuation may lead to a decline if asset values drop.    - **Operational Risks**: Potential setbacks such as product failures or regulatory issues could impact the stock price.  2. **Nvidia**:    - **Competition Risk**: Increasing competition from companies like AMD could challenge their market dominance.    - **Supply Chain Issues**: Potential disruptions in their supply chain might affect performance and market share.  3. **Microsoft**:    - **Market Expectations**: If the market anticipates further growth, it could lead to overvaluation or subsequent drops if expectations are not met.    - **Competition**: The AI sector faces competition from larger tech firms like Google and Amazon, which may limit Microsoft's growth.

Both stocks have seen big runs in June..In short, CRWV provides exposure to the AI frenzy, whereas CRCL is a play on the mainstreaming of digital dollars and the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape..Let's take a closer glance at each..Given its backing by AI-favorite NVIDIA, the IPO reflected one of the most exciting we've seen in years. An SEC filing in late May 2025 revealed NVIDIA has a $900 million stake, reflecting one of its largest investors..It's also important to know that NVIDIA supplies CoreWeave with most of its high-performance GPUs that power CRWV's AI infrastructure. Some time back, investors raised flags concerning the massive amount of sales NVIDIA generated from CRWV, but that concern has since evaporated..The company's latest set of quarterly results were driven by accelerating demand for its AI offerings, with sales up a staggering 420% year-over-year. Revenue backlog totaled a strong $25.9 billion, with CRWV also securing more lucrative deals with enterprises..Up 270% since its IPO, the stock remains a great play on the AI frenzy, which appears to still be in the early innings..Circle is a global financial technology firm that enables businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce, and financial applications worldwide. It's the issuer of USDC, the world's second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, widely used across exchanges, DeFi platforms, and institutional trading venues..But what does that even mean? CEO Jeremy Allaire explains simply –.'If you could take what we think of as money, make it digital and available on the internet, then that would dramatically change the way we use money and open up opportunities around the world. That's the idea behind Circle.'.Since their debut on June 5th, shares have gone on a massive run. It's worth noting that Cathie Wood's ARK had a big win on the stock, purchasing roughly 4.5 million shares on its first day of trading.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-111700328.html," The analysis of the news highlights potential risks associated with investments in CoreWeave, Circle Internet, and NVIDIA based on their performance after IPOs.

Recursion has partnered with the AI juggernaut Nvidia to build a powerful supercomputer, for example..It is also attracting interest from some prominent Wall Street figures, including Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest. The investment firm owns about $164 million worth of the stock, as of this writing. Yet, Recursion has not been performing well -- shares are down by 19% this year..Should investors take this opportunity to buy the stock on the dip?.People in the tech world are familiar with Moore's law, which predicts an exponential increase in computing power at a lower cost. Fewer people are familiar with Eroom's law (Moore's backward), the observation that the business of developing novel medicines has become more expensive even as technology has improved. Drugmakers spend considerable time and money to get their products to market. Most new compounds never go that far, and many that do hardly make enough money to justify the investment that went into them..Recursion is looking to solve that problem. The company has developed an AI-powered operating system (OS) that features a library of human genes. This OS is constantly testing clinical compounds against this library. The most promising ones are chosen to be tested in the clinic. The potential benefits here could be faster discovery, faster development, lower costs, longer time spent under patent exclusivity on the market, higher sales, higher profits, and higher margins..In other words, if Recursion Pharmaceuticals is successful, it could transform the pharmaceutical industry. Besides developing its own medicines, Recursion would also license out its AI-powered OS to other companies. That business might look even more attractive. It is far less cost-intensive than developing medicines (even if that becomes easier thanks to Recursion, it will still require tens of millions of dollars to undergo clinical trials), while also returning much higher margins..That's why some investors like Wood are interested in the stock. The company's upside potential is massive. And it got an even rosier outlook earlier this year when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that it would be slowly phasing out animal testing in pre-clinical trials in favor of other methods, including AI-based models.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beaten-down-cathie-wood-artificial-093000431.html," The article discusses Recursion Pharmaceuticals' partnership with Nvidia, suggesting a potential buy in Cathie Wood's AI stock. However, this news comes with several associated risks:  1. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The company must navigate the FDA approval process for its AI applications in drug development. Delays or rejections could impede progress.  2. **Dependency on Partnerships**: Significant reliance on Nvidia could pose financial instability if the partnership doesn't materialize as expected, affecting funding and growth.  3. **Market Perception Risks**: The beaten-down status of the stock might lead to investor hesitancy, with concerns about whether it's overvalued or undervalued.  4. **Competitive Landscape**: The biotech sector is competitive; Recursion may face challenges if it fails to outperform existing players despite innovations.  5. **Technical Challenges**: Integration of AI into drug development could encounter unforeseen technical issues, affecting project timelines and costs.  In conclusion, while the partnership presents a promising opportunity for growth, these risks highlight the need for careful consideration before making an investment decision."

On Friday, the relative price of hedging against a 10% decline in the ETF, compared with a similar rally, hit its highest level since early April..The growing skepticism toward the megacap rally shows investors are well aware of the risks, should trade tensions flare again and reignite worries around the US economic outlook. The tech behemoths fell harder than the broad market during the early April turmoil, and some investors see a threat that it could happen again..“Right now, high valuations, and to some extent economic impacts of the tariffs, are still worries,” Rocky Fishman, founder of research firm Asym 500, said in an interview..Helped by a positive earnings season, a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven — Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — has rallied 31% since April 8, the day before Trump paused most of his harshest tariffs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index is up 20%..Besides trade-war fears, there are other reasons for concern about the group, such as the amount of cash they’re throwing at artificial intelligence. That spending is fueling concerns about profit margins, and investors have high expectations that those expenditures will pay off..High valuations present another worry. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven gauge is trading at 29 times projected profits, above a 10-year average of 28. That compares with the S&P 500’s forward multiple of 22..Earlier this month, Needham analysts downgraded Apple’s stock to a hold rating, warning that the company’s valuation looks “expensive on several metrics.” They also cited the iPhone maker’s vulnerability to US tariffs..The uptick in demand for hedges underscores investor doubts about the staying power of the current rally, Fishman said..“With these reluctant rallies, where people don’t feel too excited and they just see the market keep on going up, then you start seeing investors getting nervous about giving up the gains they’ve picked up,” said Fishman.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-furious-rally-forces-093000399.html," The primary risk indicated by the news is **derivative-based risk**, specifically involving options trading strategies used by hedge funds or traders to mitigate potential declines in Big Tech's stock price due to ongoing trade uncertainties and increased market volatility.
