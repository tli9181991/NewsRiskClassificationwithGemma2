We are watching Super Microcomputer, advanced micro devices, also known as AMD, and Apple. First up, Super Microcomputer stock sliding after announcing it plans to offer $2 billion in convertible senior notes, due in 2030. Investors can potentially buy an extra $300 million in bonds within about two weeks of the offering, and some of the funds will be used to protect shareholders from stock dilution during the bond to share conversion. One Bloomberg analyst says that the offering is necessary to support growth and should provide a cash boost to help meet AI demand. They you're taking a look at the movement of shares here. They're moving down in reaction by about 4.2%. But, but Jay, as we think about what this cash is needed for and what this essentially is trying to ensure among investors, is that you have more longer-term interest and participants who are looking to see where this cash .infusion could ultimately help them in carrying out some of the scale that's necessary to continue to compete, especially within the demand profile that we've seen for chips right now, and how generative AI has been one of the core drivers of that addressable market. .Well, that's the hope. But right now, investors have been punished owning this stock. And the ones that got in it, remember, when it was, you know, a $200 billion dollar market cap. Is it $25 billion right now? So, while this could help over the near term and hopefully set them up for the long term, uh they've kind of been left behind in the dust and there's just too much competition in the space where they've all of a sudden become the forgotten player in this space. So, to me, this this is good to strengthen the bottom line, but uh you know, technically, fundamentally, they still have a long way to go. So, uh let's hope that this is another step in the right direction to get back to where they once were. .Yeah, absolutely. And especially how the allegations certainly did put a major dent in investor sentiment around this name, still essentially trying to win back perhaps some of that support as well, to your point here. Next up, we're tracking AMD, upgraded to buy from hold at Melius. The firm also raising its price target to $65 or $65 to $175. So, they've raised that price target, so it's now $175. Melius saying that AMD's development in AI accelerators and computing make it particularly attractive in terms of future growth. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from most hyper-scale cloud computing companies who want to build out artificial intelligence interfacing here. You're taking a look at shares of AMD right now higher by about 1 and a half percent. Where does this sit within your broader evaluation of the chip landscape? .Well, this has been a laggered in the sector for a while. So, to see that upgrade and to see that we've kind of put in a tradeable bottom in the stock to me is good. So, I'm just going to look at this from a trade perspective from a technical perspective because I don't know the ins and outs and I'm not going to profess I do compared to some of the other chip makers in this space. But technically, this just broke a long-term downtrend. Risk reward setup is somewhere where you want to take a shot at this if as long as it stays above that 200 day moving average around 125. I I like it. It looks like it's going to have a little bit more room to run. Uh the target price was about 165 I think you said. 160 looks like a good risk reward setup with a 5 to 10 point downside. So to me, this is a tradeable bottom in the semi space is coming back. And uh there's one big semiconductor stock they've really take them all to another level uh in Nvidia that breaks 150. So to me, I think this is a good place from a risk reward setup to get into the name. .Yeah. One of the other notes within this note or one of the comments within this note, our hunch is that we are in the middle of another move to the upside again, as investors are about to envision even bigger GPU, graphics processing unit, figures in 2026 through 2028. They're counting on a sustainable surge here in inferencing, where investing in AMD's platform seems to be more attractive for hyperscalers and sovereigns. We will see if that comes to fruition here. We got to talk one more name for you though, and that is Apple. Apple potentially looking to make a bid to acquire Perplexity AI. This is according to a Bloomberg report. Perplexity, which was recently valued at $14 billion, would build out Apple's AI infrastructure, specifically an AI search engine. Now, these discussions are in the very early stages, we should note, and it's possible that discussions will not lead to any kind of offer here. And shares of Apple, they're moving lower by about three tenths of a percent, but around that offer too as of right now. You know, as we're seeing this interest from Apple now to make sure that they don't miss out on what the next wave of search engines could look like, powered by generative AI. What does that signal to you about Apple's interest in making its ecosystem even more sticky, and how that would read through to the investor thesis and how that could shift if this does go through? .Well, investors have been waiting for that next big thing from Apple for a long time. But they've been looking on the hardware side. .And that's it. And this this could be it. We we didn't talk about Siri at the last WWDC event which was two weeks ago. It kind of was forgotten where a year ago that's all they focused on was Siri, Siri, Siri. And now it's going to turn on as I say that. I apologize to everyone in the audience. But what is going to happen now is they need to kick the tires on this. And AI perplexity is a known. It's a big name. They have the cash on the sidelines to spend. It's time for them to step up and do something monumental. And if they're going to get into the AI space, this is a name you have to watch carefully. So it could just be talk for now, and I'm sure the price tag is going to be astronomical. But if anyone can afford to do it and anyone needs to change things up, it's Apple. So to have these discussions is a good first step. Let's see where it goes, but they need to shake things up because right now they're just surviving, when they're surviving, they're thriving on their utility metrics and not in the innovation side of things. So let's see if this is a game changer for them. It hovers around 200. It's a nice interesting level. Let's see if you can break it above. .Yeah, to your point, uh what what is, you know, $13, $14 billion in terms of an acquisition when you typically tend to see Apple holding onto hundreds of billions of dollars in cash on hand here. We're going to continue to track all of those names here, and you can too by scanning the QR code on your screen to track all of your Yahoo finances trending tickers throughout the session.

Coleman declined to comment on the reasons for the delay, adding that they’re unrelated to any changes the Trump administration has planned for the DFC..“There’s business as usual” at the DFC, Coleman said. “You’ll see us playing a lot in critical minerals infrastructure, both digital and transportation, as well as energy, especially here on the African continent.”.The DFC has committed a $3.4 million technical assistance grant to Pensana Plc’s rare-earths extraction and processing project in Angola and is in talks to finance Carrinho Group’s agricultural manufacturing plant through a senior secured-debt facility..In separate comments, Angola’s Minister of State for Economic Coordination Jose de Lima Massano attributed the delays to contractual clauses, including guarantees sought by the funders..“These aren’t state loans,” Massano said. “We’re working to ensure the right conditions for private investment to advance quickly.”.Neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo is also asking the DFC to support plans to rehabilitate a railway line from the country’s copper and cobalt mines around the town of Kolwezi that connects to the corridor, Congolese Transport Minister Jean-Pierre Bemba said..The country is already in talks with the European Union and the European Investment Bank about supporting a public-private partnership to develop the project, Bemba said. A small amount of planned funding for the project from USAID was blocked amid cuts to the agency by the Trump administration earlier this year..Congo’s government plans to launch a tender to build the infrastructure in November, with the hope the railway may be running in three years, Bemba said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-finalizing-500-million-african-055920928.html

(NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder saw as the alchemy of collaboration..Jobs told interviewer Bob Cringely that, as a boy, a widower neighbor showed him a homemade tumbler, ""a motor and a coffee can and a little band between them,"" filled with ""regular old ugly rocks,"" water and grit. After a night of clattering, the stones emerged ""amazingly beautiful,"" he recalled..Don’t Miss:.Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share..Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share..The tumbling, he said, mirrors ""incredibly talented people bumping up against each other, having arguments, having fights sometimes, making some noise"" until both ideas and individuals are refined. Jobs, then running NeXT and poised to return to Apple, argued that the best companies court constructive friction. “...Working together, they polish each other and they polish the ideas,” he remarked..According to an NBC article from 2017, former colleagues say Jobs organized project rooms so engineers and designers could not avoid debate, a practice later echoed in Apple's iPhone and Pixar's story-brain sessions..Why It Matters: Steve Jobs routinely engineered tension to sharpen ideas, whether by ringing Pixar colleagues ""at any time, day or night, three in the morning"" and expecting instant answers, a habit Pete Docter says he now refuses to copy..His intolerance for half-measures surfaced again this month when tech watchers joked that Jobs would ""have fired everyone"" over a lackluster iOS interface, an exaggeration that nonetheless echoed stories of him dismissing teams that failed to hit the mark on the first iPhone's glass swap and other last-minute pivots..Yet the same razor-edged perfectionism often came wrapped in jolts of generosity meant to keep morale high.

2025-06-24 08:44:00,Court filings reveal OpenAI and io’s early work on an AI device,"The ChatGPT maker seems to be more than a year out from selling its first hardware device, which may not be an in-ear product whatsoever. Given what the company said in this lawsuit, it appears it is also exploring other form factors.","Legal filings submitted earlier this month from lawyers representing OpenAI and Jony Ive’s io reveal new details about the companies’ efforts to build a mass-market AI hardware device..The filings are part of a trademark dispute lawsuit filed this month by iyO, a Google-backed hardware startup developing custom-molded earpieces that connect to other devices. Over the weekend, OpenAI pulled promotional materials related to its $6.5 billion acquisition of Jony Ive’s io startup in order to comply with a court order involved in the suit. OpenAI says it’s fighting iyO’s allegations of trademark infringement..For the last year, OpenAI executives and former Apple leaders now working at io have vigorously researched in-ear hardware devices, according to filings submitted in iyO’s lawsuit. In a June 12 filing, lawyers representing OpenAI and io said the companies purchased at least 30 headphone sets from various companies to explore what’s on the market today. In recent months, OpenAI and io executives also met with iyO’s leadership and demoed their in-ear technology, according to emails revealed in the case..That said, OpenAI’s first device in collaboration with io may not be a pair of headphones at all..Tang Tan, a longtime Apple executive who co-founded io and serves as the startup’s chief hardware officer, claims in a declaration to the court that the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io’s launch video “is not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.” Tan notes that the design of said prototype in not yet finalized and that the product is at least a year away from being advertised or offered for sale..The form factor of OpenAI and io’s first hardware device has largely remained a mystery. Altman merely stated in io’s launch video that the startup was working to create a “family” of AI devices with various capabilities, and Ive said io’s first prototype “completely captured” his imagination..Altman had previously told OpenAI’s employees at a meeting that the company’s prototype, when finished, would be able to fit in a pocket or sit on a desk, according to the Wall Street Journal. The OpenAI CEO reportedly said the device would be fully aware of a user’s surroundings and that it would be a “third device” for consumers to use alongside their smartphone and laptop..“Our intent with this collaboration was, and is, to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,” said Altman in a declaration to the court submitted on June 12..Lawyers representing OpenAI also said in a filing that the company has explored a wide range of devices, including ones that were “desktop-based and mobile, wireless and wired, wearable and portable.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/court-filings-reveal-openai-io-234438912.html

2025-06-24 04:54:00,Apple’s Liquid Glass interface improves with release of iOS 26 Beta 2,"These are not likely the final adjustments, given that iOS 26 doesn't launch publicly until the fall. However, they are indications that Apple is actively listening to early user feedback and making tweaks accordingly.","With Monday’s release of iOS 26 Beta 2, Apple has fixed one of the more glaring issues with Liquid Glass, its divisive new user interface design for the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple devices, announced earlier this month at WWDC 2025..The refreshed user interface modernizes the operating system’s look and feel with a design system inspired by the optical qualities of glass, including the way it refracts light and its translucency..However, early iOS 26 testers, somewhat unfairly, were quick to point out the flaws with the updated look in the early developer beta. Though the beta build is not yet finished, users shared screenshots and criticized areas where Liquid Glass fell short in terms of readability and usability..One of the users’ larger concerns was with how Liquid Glass made the Control Center (the menu accessed by swiping down on the right side of the iPhone’s screen) nearly unreadable. Because of its semi-transparent nature, it was hard to differentiate the Control Center’s buttons and sliders from the icons and widgets on the iPhone’s Home Screen that appeared underneath..In the newly released beta, Apple has addressed the problem with the Control Center by adjusting the background blur, which better obscures the Home Screen content underneath..Notifications in the first beta were also hard to read, as many had pointed out. In the updated beta, they’re a bit sharper but still need work, especially for readability on brighter and lighter backgrounds.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-liquid-glass-interface-improves-195429256.html

While Bitcoin briefly fell from $103,000 to $100,000, it never dropped below the $100,000 mark, unlike in previous cycles..As of June 23, Bitcoin's 60-day realized volatility had fallen to approximately 27% to 28%, according to Bitwise Europe's André Dragosch, which is lower than the S&P 500, which declined by 30%, the NASDAQ 100 by approximately 35%, and ""Magnificent 7"" by 40%..Join the discussion with Scott Melker on the Roundtable here..The ""Magnificent Seven"" are the top seven U.S. tech stocks that have performed exceptionally well: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla..However, this is not a one-off situation for Bitcoin. Historically speaking, Bitcoin's volatility has been the lowest..In February 2022, Bitcoin hit volatility levels of 60% to 65% during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, showing a stark difference from the current pattern, per data available on Glassnode..Analysts also suggest that the difference is mainly attributed to long-term holders and the use of institutional investors..Join the discussion with Mario Nawfal on the Roundtable here. .According to the Glassnode data, over 30% of Bitcoin's circulating supply is controlled by just 216 centralized entities — like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, crypto exchanges, and corporate treasuries — compared to long-term holders, who now control a record 14.53 million BTC..Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, believes the price trajectory for BTC will remain bullish, supported by both central bank policies and investor confidence..At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $101,197.17, up by 2.16% in the last 24 hours, as per Kraken's price feed..US stocks aren’t safe in heated global tensions anymore first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 23, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 23, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-aren-t-safe-194500568.html

But with some of that revenue at risk, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said Monday that the government must use that money with an eye on the longer term..“One of my deep lessons from the aftermath of the global financial crisis is, when capital investment is decreased, the costs mount up in the future,” he said at Bloomberg’s Future of Finance in Ireland event in Dublin. “If our growth outlook does change, we will use our fiscal position to try to maintain and support capital investment and do all we can to avoid cutting it back again.”.The rapidly changing global backdrop is also raising concern for employment. Pharmaceutical tariffs, if imposed by President Donald Trump, are a key worry, with Donohoe warning they could cost the economy 75,000 jobs..While Donohoe said Ireland remains an attractive destination for investment, both the government and the country’s central bank have had to acknowledge the threats. Both recently cut their growth forecasts, citing Ireland’s large exposure to US President Donald Trump’s volatile trade policies..The US administration has repeatedly singled out the Irish model, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Ireland runs a surplus at America’s expense. Trump even raised the matter with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin at a St Patrick’s Day White House reception..While Trump’s policies have raised new threats for Ireland and Europe, governments are also sensing an opportunity to take advantage and boost competitiveness. Germany is increasing spending, providing a fiscal boost for the region’s largest economy, while central bankers and politicians on the continent are talking up the euro’s global profile as US policies shake dollar confidence..“Political events in the US have catalyzed something in Europe and have changed things,” said John O’Toole, global head of multi asset solutions at Amundi. “Europe is now on a path to reasserting itself and standing on its own two feet.”.Real progress is going to require Europe to do a lot more on issues like improving its capital markets and pools of liquidity.

Together, they make up the “Prominent 10.""","Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S..It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy..Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%..Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI..But what about China?.Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services..Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years..The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC..E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/move-over-magnificent-7-goldman-094217732.html

JBL, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and Ericsson ERIC..Jabil Inc. was a notable standout in a relatively quiet earnings lineup this week, as investors eyed ongoing conflicts in the Middle East that could potentially impact markets..That said, Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronics manufacturing services and is worthy of investors' attention after posting strong results for its fiscal third quarter on Tuesday..Trading near 52-week highs of over $200 a share, here's a look at why Jabil stock may be poised for more upside..Serving a wide range of major global companies across various industries, two of Jabil’s most prominent customers include Apple and Amazon. As two of its largest clients, Apple relies on Jabil’s manufacturing components for iPhones, among other devices, with Amazon relying on Jabil’s computing and hardware services for AWS..While Apple and Amazon have accounted for significant portions of Jabil’s revenue, the company has made significant efforts to diversify its customer base, with other noteworthy and diverse clients being healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson and communication networks leader Ericsson..Briefly reviewing Jabil’s strong quarterly results, Q3 sales spiked 15% year over year to $7.82 billion and topped estimates of $7.08 billion by 10%. More impressively, Q3 EPS of $2.55 soared 35% from $1.89 in the comparative quarter and beat earnings expectations of $2.33 per share by 9%..Continuing its compelling and consistent operational performance, Jabil has now surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 21 consecutive quarters with an average earnings surprise of 6.68% over the last four quarters..Offering guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter, Jabil expects Q4 sales in the range of $7.1 billion-$7.8 billion, with the current Zacks Consensus at $7.55 billion or 8% growth. Jabil expects Q4 EPS at $2.64-$3.04, with Zacks projections currently at $2.75 or 19% growth..Correlating with its diverse customer base and strategic alignment with secular trends such as AI, Jabil expects to see continued revenue expansion, margin enhancement, and robust free cash flow generation in the coming years..Year to date, Jabil stock is up over +40% and has blown away the performance of the broader indexes, which have been virtually flat. More intriguing, JBL is sitting on gains of more than +200% in the last three years to impressively outpace the stock performances of its top big tech customers in Amazon and Apple and the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq’s returns of +60% and +80%, respectively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-090500313.html

As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power..This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines..And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth..If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.).For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare..Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each..And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI..I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since.

Against this backdrop, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are set to soar in the second half.","Artificial intelligence is an area of enormous potential for companies and investors..After a few difficult months, AI stocks could resume their 2024 momentum and soar in the second half..Three in particular could lead the way..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks skyrocketed in 2024 amid excitement about this technology that could revolutionize businesses, saving time and money and leading to important discoveries. These players faced a few difficult months recently due to concerns about a potential economic slowdown. However, some of the uncertainty has passed, suggesting better days may be ahead for AI stocks..Against this backdrop, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are set to soar in the second half. Here's why..President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports weighed on technology stocks, including AI chip giant Nvidia, several weeks ago. This pushed Nvidia down nearly 30% from the start of the year through early April. Though the president initially exempted electronics products, this exemption was temporary, suggesting chips and other items would face tariffs at some point in the near future..But Nvidia has since rebounded, thanks to optimism that tariffs won't be as steep as originally expected and as the company showed the strength of its earnings through the first quarter of the year. Nvidia's revenue surged 69% to $44 billion, demand remained strong, and customer comments indicate that their spending plans for the year remain intact. This bodes well for ongoing growth for Nvidia..On top of this, the chip giant is making investments in U.S. manufacturing to limit any eventual tariff impact and sticks to its plan to update chips on an annual basis -- a move that should keep it ahead of rivals..Today, Nvidia trades for only 33 times forward earnings estimates, down from about 50 times just a few months ago, and this level offers the stock plenty of room to run in the second half..Among all the top tech stocks, Apple may be the one that has suffered the most amid the recent tariff turbulence. Trump, displeased that Apple has generally produced most iPhones abroad, even threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's imported iPhones. Meanwhile, Apple has made efforts to diversify its manufacturing, with a plan to move much of it from China to India..Uncertainty remains as the president wants Apple to bring iPhone production to the U.S., but doing this could result in a drastically higher price for the smartphone. All of this has hurt Apple stock, which is down about 20% since the start of the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stocks-set-soar-second-221000712.html

Boyle told Wired that by using a rig that could hold 20 iPhone Pro Max cameras, the filmmaking team created “basically a poor man’s bullet time,” capturing the brutal action scenes from a variety of angles..Even when he wasn’t using the rig, Boyle (who once directed a biopic of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs) said the iPhone was the movie’s “principal camera,” albeit after disabling settings like automatic focus and adding special accessories..“Filming with iPhones allowed us to move without huge amounts of equipment,” Boyle said, noting that the team shot in parts of Northumbria that look like “it would have looked 1,000 years ago,” so the iPhone allowed them “to move quickly and lightly to areas of the countryside that we wanted to retain their lack of human imprint.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-danny-boyle-shot-28-202200987.html
2025-06-22 22:01:00,Nvidia: How the chipmaker evolved from a gaming startup to an AI giant,"Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI.","Over the past two decades, Nvidia (NVDA) has skyrocketed into global conversation..The semiconductor company is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)..Beyond its strengths in the gaming, data, and AI fields, Nvidia announced plans this March for a quantum research center in Boston, where CEO Jensen Huang said researchers could tackle problems from drug discovery to materials development..Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI..On April 5, 1993, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia with an initial focus on designing and producing 3D graphics processors for computing and video games..The company’s first product release, the multimedia processor NV1, didn’t get the reception the founders were hoping for. What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html

The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years.","Amazon has a clear path toward a $3 trillion market cap through its cloud computing growth and AI investments..While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years..The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.While not all have stayed there, there have been three tech giants that have crossed the $3 trillion market cap threshold: Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html

Its stock tanked after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcements, since its iPhones are predominantly made overseas, and its artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades have underwhelmed. Apple stock is trailing the market, down 21% year to date, even as the S&P 500 is starting to climb again..Is it as bad as the market thinks? Here's one metric you should see before you decide..Apple has a wide ecosystem of products and services that generates long-term loyalty and engagement. The company has always been focused on the user experience, with well-designed products that work. The iPhone is its premier product, with more than 2.3 million in circulation, and fans tend to upgrade at high rates..There's been some lumpiness with iPhone sales over the past few years, since customers bought more phones when the pandemic started, and growth has tapered off. In the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended March 29), iPhone sales inched up only 2% over last year. However, these users will be due for new phones over the next few years, steering the growth cycle back to historical norms..Apple has been able to monetize its users with higher-margin services like streaming and fitness apps, which lead to a stronger bottom line. As users engage more with Apple's platform, it reinforces the ecosystem in a positive cycle. Service revenue was up 12% year over year in the second quarter, and earnings per share increased 8%..This may be why Apple has been slower on the AI uptick than investors have been expecting. Unlike other AI companies like Nvidia and Amazon, Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, is a consumer-facing service rather than a platform or product for developers. Like the rest of its ecosystem, its interest is in producing tools that enhance the user interface and keep its customers happy. Apple is not the kind of company that's going to launch new products or features for hype. It's all about quality, which is why its products are expensive, and for most of its users, worth it..This ecosystem creates a ""stickiness"" that makes Apple a great company. Warren Buffett has described it as a ""very, very, very special product, and which has an enormously widespread ecosystem, and the product's extremely sticky.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-apple-slowing-down-1-081200529.html
2025-06-22 15:57:00,Nvidia vs Microsoft Stock: Which Will Reach $4 Trillion First?,Both tech giants are neck and neck on the path toward the major milestone.,"Nvidia and Microsoft both benefit from the increasing spending and excitement around artificial intelligence..Nvidia maintains strong revenue growth for its data center chips..Microsoft's cloud computing revenue is accelerating while its enterprise software benefits from new AI features..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.At the end of 2024, tech analyst Dan Ives predicted Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) would all reach a $4 trillion valuation in 2025. He expected Apple to hit the mark first, followed by Nvidia, and then Microsoft. But I think he got the order reversed: Microsoft will reach a $4 trillion valuation first..Both Nvidia and Microsoft currently have market caps around $3.5 trillion, while Apple has seen its stock fall to about $3 trillion in market cap. The leading tech giants have received a clear boost from artificial intelligence (AI) spending, but Apple has struggled to make headway in advanced AI capabilities..As a result, it looks like either Nvidia or Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion valuation threshold first. And despite strong operating results from Nvidia, Microsoft looks to have the edge..Nvidia's strong results over the last few years were driven by unprecedented growth in its data center business. For the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year..The hyperscale customers like Microsoft are buying Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can produce them. In fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year..However, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including Microsoft. If those customers pull back on AI spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth..It faces plenty of challenges from other GPU makers and custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. Several of them are working to build chips for both training and inference that offer better price performance than Nvidia's all-in-one solution..So, while the GPU maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. The stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. That's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as Nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in AI, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-vs-microsoft-stock-reach-075700927.html

Just as the iPhone represents great hardware backed by an impenetrable ecosystem, Nvidia has built something far more valuable than fast chips -- it has created the core operating system for AI..The company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform has become the default language for AI development, with over 4 million developers now embedded in the ecosystem. Switching to a competitor means rewriting years of code, creating a switching cost that grows stronger every day..But Nvidia isn't stopping at software dominance. The company has systematically expanded into every layer of the AI stack. DGX Cloud lets companies rent AI supercomputers by the hour, democratizing access to massive computing power. New enterprise platforms help businesses deploy AI without armies of data scientists..The Omniverse platform powers everything from factory simulations to digital twins of entire cities, while the majority of automakers now rely on Nvidia's DRIVE platform for autonomous vehicle development..This isn't diversification for its own sake. Each new product strengthens the core GPU business. A company using Nvidia for robotics simulations naturally gravitates toward Nvidia chips for its data centers. The network effects compound with each customer.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-nvidias-projected-9-annual-143000920.html

2025-06-21 16:35:00,Is Apple Stock In Trouble?,The company is struggling to innovate with cutting-edge technologies.,"Apple has failed with its first foray into virtual reality..The company is falling behind in artificial intelligence..Apple stock trades at an expensive P/E ratio..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has entered a rough patch. The smartphone and computer giant is down around 10% in the last 12 months, while artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are soaring..Management has made some major missteps in virtual reality and false promises with its Siri and Apple Intelligence services. Revenue is growing slowly, and innovation seems to be lacking for this storied technology brand..Is Apple in trouble? Here's why investors should be concerned about owning shares of this stock..Back in early 2024, Apple released the Vision Pro, an expensive virtual reality headset that it promised was the next evolution in computing. The device sold for $3,500 and had a futuristic ski-goggle look and aimed to replace the personal computer for people working at home. Apple has been researching virtual and augmented reality technologies for years, but this was its first large foray into the cutting-edge computing space..Now in June 2025, the Apple Vision Pro looks like a total flop. The company had to scale back production because of weak demand, failed to attract developers to make applications for the device, and has sold fewer than 1 million devices (reportedly) since its launch. Even if it sold 1 million of these devices a year, that equates to $3.5 billion in annual revenue, compared to $400 billion in consolidated revenue for Apple. The device isn't going to move the needle financially..The Vision Pro can officially be called a flop. New versions may change consumer sentiment, but Apple has failed in its first foray into the virtual reality space. This company is still being driven by the iPhone and iPhone software and services..Speaking of smartphones, Apple has promised customers and investors that new AI-focused updates will be coming to Apple devices shortly. Bullish investors see this as a reason for customers to upgrade their iPhones, which has been a nagging issue for the company, as customers are sticking with older devices for longer..As with the Vision Pro, Apple talked a big game around upgrades for Siri and Apple Intelligence products. However, the actual products released have been lackluster..At its annual developer conference, the company delayed the launch of AI Siri to early next year. At the same time, AI competitors, such as Alphabet and OpenAI, are pushing forward with cutting-edge productivity tools, leaving Apple in the dust.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-trouble-083500043.html

The talks, reported by Bloomberg and involving senior executives including M&A chief Adrian Perica and services head Eddy Cue, are still at an early stage and may not result in a formal offer.","Investing.com -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity AI, a fast-growing artificial intelligence startup known for its advanced chatbot platform. The talks, reported by Bloomberg and involving senior executives including M&A chief Adrian Perica and services head Eddy Cue, are still at an early stage and may not result in a formal offer..The move underscores Apple’s struggle to keep pace with rivals amid increasing pressure to integrate artificial intelligence across its hardware and software ecosystem. In particular, Apple has faced persistent delays in its efforts to upgrade Siri, leaving the voice assistant trailing competitors such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s Grok..Perplexity, recently valued at $14 billion in a funding round, could significantly accelerate Apple’s ambitions in AI-driven search and user interaction. The acquisition would also represent the largest in Apple’s history, surpassing its previous deals in both scale and impact on the company’s long-term strategy..Apple’s interest in Perplexity also comes as it reassesses its relationship with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose search engine generates an estimated $20 billion a year for Apple as the default option on iPhones and other devices. That deal has come under regulatory scrutiny from U.S. antitrust authorities, fueling uncertainty around its future and prompting Apple to consider building its own AI-based search engine..According to Bloomberg, Apple has not yet contacted Perplexity’s leadership about a potential takeover. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reportedly attempted its own bid earlier this year but could not come to terms, instead pivoting to a $14.3 billion deal for a 49% stake in Scale AI as it builds a team focused on producing a “superintelligence.”.The AI market has become increasingly competitive as Big Tech firms vie for top talent and cutting-edge capabilities to stay ahead in the generative AI race. For Apple, generally conservative about large-scale acquisitions, a move on Perplexity would signal a strategic departure, highlighting the urgency of closing its AI gap..Related articles.Apple internally weighs bid for ChatGPT rival Perplexity, Bloomberg says.This sector is uniquely positioned to capture infrastructure spend growth: analyst.Caloric reset driven by GLP-1 drugs could cut food volumes by over 10%",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-internally-weighs-bid-chatgpt-220653076.html

China’s system is improving but remains cumbersome, they said, contrary to Trump’s assurances rare earths would flow “up front” after a June 11 accord struck in London..The delays are holding an array of American industries hostage to the rocky US-China relationship, as some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China. That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing in Geneva last month, and triggering fresh rounds of retaliation..Interviews with multiple Western buyers, industry insiders and officials familiar with discussions revealed frustration over vague policies in both countries and lingering confusion about what level of magnet approvals from China would trigger Trump to abandon his tit-for-tat export curbs..“Even if export approvals accelerate, there are so many unknowns about the licensing regime that it’s impossible for companies to have a strong sense of certainty about future supply,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “At a minimum, they need to factor in a real possibility that talks could break down again, and exports will be halted.”.In response to China’s sluggishness on magnets, Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China until President Xi Jinping restores rare-earth exports. Companies subject to Washington’s curbs have halted billions of dollars in planned shipments as they wait for players in unrelated sectors to secure permits from Beijing, which could take weeks or even months to process, given the current pace..Corporate chiefs affected by the export-control spat have sought clarity from the administration on its strategy, according to people familiar with the matter.

2025-06-20 21:00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +5.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.67 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-trending-stock-130002356.html

2025-06-20 19:30:00,VisionOS 26 proves Apple isn’t treating the Vision Pro like a hobby,"Two years after its unveiling, the headset still hasn’t gone mass market. But it’s getting better in ways that point to a broader future for spatial computing.","In 2023, the flagship reveal at Apple’s WWDC keynote was unquestionably the debut of the Vision Pro. The headset wasn’t just Apple’s first all-new platform since the Apple Watch. It was also the company’s opportunity to define what, exactly, a computer you strap to your head should do..Most Read from Fast Company.Housing market map: Zillow just released its updated home price forecast for 400-plus housing markets.Kroger is closing 60 stores: See the list of locations that are reportedly shuttering in 2025 so far.Perplexity’s new AI features are a game changer. Here’s how to make the most of them.Being Apple, it purposefully steered clear of existing concepts such as the metaverse and virtual reality. Instead, it embraced a term it stood a shot of owning: spatial computing. Rather than aiming to nail one or two experiences—movie-watching or gaming or even industrial-strength applications such as training—the Vision Pro would aspire to deliver general-purpose utility reminiscent of the Mac. Just in a radically new, immersive form..Flash-forward to this year’s WWDC. No longer the keynote’s headliner, Vision Pro took its place among the Apple platforms getting operating system updates in the fall—in its case, VisionOS 26. That’s not a sign of diminished relevance, though. Those yearly software upgrades keep Apple gear evolving and improving; over time, they contribute more to a product’s relevance than even the biggest-bang hardware introductions. And VisionOS 26’s meatiness makes for a striking contrast with the barely evolving Apple TV box, a product that still feels like a hobby at best more than 18 years after Steve Jobs described it as one..Last week, after watching the keynote at Apple Park, I got some eyes- and hands-on experience with the Vision Pro’s new features and discussed them with Steve Sinclair, senior director of Apple Vision Pro product marketing, and Jeff Norris, senior director of apps and content for the Vision Products Group. The two executives emphasized the practical ways VisionOS 26 expands on the Vision Pro’s capabilities. The upgrade, Sinclair told me, “adds new ways to connect. It adds new ways to be more immersed. It unlocks new methods to interact with the spatial digital content that we have. And it makes Vision Pro something that users can enjoy using every single day.”.Increasing the everyday value of an existing product is always worthwhile, particularly when the product in question costs $3,500 and is still in the process of establishing itself. But VisionOS 26 is part of a longer-term bet. In April, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is working on two new headsets and that CEO Tim Cook is eager to release something in a more glasses-like form factor when the technology is ready. Nobody at Apple is going to speak publicly about such unannounced products. But just the plurality of the “Vision Products Group” in Norris’s title indicates that the company doesn’t see the Vision Pro as a one-off.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visionos-26-proves-apple-isn-113000834.html

Even with the wide stock market indices approaching new all-time highs, shares of Apple are down 25%, making it one of the worst-performing large-cap technology stocks in 2025..Investors are worried about tariffs, slowing revenue growth, and antitrust lawsuits that may impact the smartphone maker's future earnings power..Is now the right time to buy the dip on Apple stock? Let's put the numbers to the test and show why Apple is a risky big tech stock to purchase today..The iPhone is still a blockbuster consumer product. Over the last six months alone, the segment has generated more than $100 billion in revenue for Apple, making it the most popular smartphone in the world by revenue..The problem for investors is the fact sales have stagnated for the last few years. Apple has been able to consistently raise the price of new iPhones, but upgrade cycles are proving longer and longer for consumers, meaning they are going more years before buying the latest device. This is a major headwind to revenue growth..In order to expand its ecosystems of devices, Apple has made inroads into wearables like the Apple Watch and AirPods. These are successful products, but will not move the needle for Apple's $400 billion in consolidated annual revenue. To do that, Apple made its largest hardware launch since the iPhone with the Vision Pro virtual reality headset. A device that costs $3,500, the headset was supposed to be Apple's next big computing paradigm, giving its users more advanced computing tools for work and pleasure..So far, it looks like the Vision Pro has been a flop. Estimates are that unit sales are cumulatively less than 1 million, with many purchasers reportedly stopping using the device after a trial period..Apple remains a hardware provider tethered to iPhone sales, a product category that has matured. Expect more struggles to grow revenue on the hardware side of things in the years ahead unless Apple can come up with a breakthrough new computing device..The golden goose of Apple's business in the last few years has been its software and services segment. Including App Store revenue, licensing deals, and revenue from its first-party apps such as Apple Music, services revenue has grown from $13 billion in 2012 to $102 billion over the last 12 months.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-dip-apple-stock-085500976.html

Some platform operators had questioned whether a user’s age could be reliably established using current technology..The results of the government-backed trial clear the way for the law to come into force by the end of the year. The findings also potentially allow other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s lead as countries around the world grapple with ways to protect children from harmful content online..“Age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective,” the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial said in a statement Friday announcing its preliminary findings..The trial’s project director, Tony Allen, said there were “no significant technological barriers” to stopping under-16s gaining social media accounts. “These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said..Under the new law, digital platforms including Snapchat, Meta-owned Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches..The trial tested a range of methods and technologies, including facial scans, inferring a user’s age based on their behavior, age verification, as well as parental controls. The tests also took into account the ways teenagers might try to circumvent age checks..“We found a plethora of approaches that fit different use cases in different ways, but we didn’t find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,” the trial said in its statement..More than 50 companies participated in the trial, while Apple Inc. and Google, developers of the most popular mobile-phone operating systems, are also contributing, Allen said on a video conference call on Friday..The trial didn’t assess public acceptance for any particular technology or the costs involved. The accuracy of the different methods, for example the margin of error for facial analysis, wasn’t made available.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-moves-closer-011443922.html

2025-06-20 01:36:00,"The Week in AI: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked.""","A new civil war in AI, Andreessen's rant, and Zuck splashes the pot.","Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.""CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA NVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in ""the revolution"" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up after Apple AAPL researchers released their paper ""The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.""We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models ""give up"" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply ""token prediction"" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the ""vibe-coding"" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the ""limitations"" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled ""The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking."" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the ""top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted"" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article ""This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.""And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work ""as fast as possible""...""Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.""Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the ""Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.""I have several posts in the comments of the ""The Week in AI"" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.""Translation: AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: ""The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle."" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled ""The Gentle Singularity.""I call it his ""love letter"" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a ""symbiosis between people and AI"" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of ""post-labor economics"" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the ""not-so-gentle"" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be ""hip.""On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing that Alphabet GOOGL is ""firing on all cylinders across AI"" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last ""search is dead"" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta Platforms META plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be ""mined and modeled"" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough, Advanced Micro Devices AMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...""The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?""It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.""I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer ""thinking."" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other ""intelligence experts"" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line: To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

Srouji noted those partners are already integrating AI into their software suites to handle growing design complexity..Apple's chip roadmap has included monumental betsmost notably the 2020 shift from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Apple Silicon across Mac desktops and laptops. Srouji said that all-in strategy, with no backup plan, underpinned the company's ability to optimize performance and power efficiency across devices like the M1 and M2 processors and the Vision Pro headset..He argued that AI-enhanced tools could represent a similarly transformative leap by automating repetitive tasks and enabling more iterative experimentation..Investors should watch how quickly EDA providers roll out AI modules and whether Apple pilots internal machine-learning models for layout, verification or synthesis. Faster cycle times could give Apple an edge over rivals, driving cost savings and potentially smoothing supply-chain bottlenecks..Why It Matters: AI-powered design could shorten chip development from years to months, helping Apple stay ahead in silicon innovation and maintain tight hardware-software integration..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-explores-ai-speed-custom-144912829.html

The news comes after Trump earlier posted on Truth Social that the U.S. is aware of the location of Iran supreme leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei but had opted not to take any action, then saying “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,” the report notes. The White House has previously said it won’t join Israel’s attacks, the report says..TIKTOK BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump intends to sign an executive order sparing TikTok from a law banning or forcing a sale of the social media platform, again delaying a deadline for enforcement of said law, the Wall Street Journal’s Alex Leary reports. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Publicly traded companies in the space include Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Reddit (RDDT) and Snap (SNAP)..STABLECOIN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to set up the first regulatory framework for stablecoins, Axios’ Stephen Neukam reports. The GENIUS Act, which has been criticized by many Democrats over corruption concerns surrounding President Trump’s growing cryptocurrency empire, was passed with a 68-30 vote, with two GOP members voting no on the legislation, the author says.

ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor can benefit from increased spending on AI computer chips.  Both semiconductor-related companies are projected to grow faster than Apple this year.","Apple is falling behind in the artificial intelligence field, and the business is growing slowly..ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor can benefit from increased spending on AI computer chips..Both semiconductor-related companies are projected to grow faster than Apple this year..10 stocks we like better than ASML ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a huge winner in the smartphone era, which it pioneered with the iPhone. Now, it looks to be at risk of falling behind in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and mixed reality. The tech giant failed with the launch of its Vision Pro product and has struggled to release any products related to consumer AI while the competition pushes ahead aggressively..It is time to forget Apple stock. Here's why you should buy two AI beneficiaries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), for your portfolio instead..Revenue growth has been stagnant at Apple for many years now. The iPhone is maturing, and while it is still a great product, there are only so many dollars floating around the world that can be dedicated to buying a smartphone. In the last decade it has released some successful ancillary products such as the Apple Watch and Air Pods, but these are not large enough to move the needle for a company with a market capitalization of $3 trillion..Management claims the company has not been resting on its laurels, but the results so far have been underwhelming. The iPhone is increasingly similar with each yearly update, minimal AI features have been added to its branded ""Apple Intelligence"" products, and the Vision Pro virtual reality headset was a flop. Other big technology companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are pushing ahead with these cutting-edge technologies, leaving Apple in the dust..Unsurprisingly, Apple's revenue growth has slowed down quite a bit as a result. This year, analysts project just 4% revenue growth for the technology giant, which will mostly come from software and services revenue. The stock trades at an expensive price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31 even though it is barely growing anymore. This leaves much to be desired with the stock's valuation. There is not much upside to owning Apple stock today versus other fast-growing technology players around the world..Speaking of fast-growing technology companies, we have ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC, for short). These are two players in the computer chip and semiconductor supply chains -- suppliers to Apple, it should be noted -- that are benefiting immensely from the rising spend on AI.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-buy-2-artificial-120000731.html
2025-06-19 18:30:00,Magnificent 7 May Need to Make Room for Broadcom,"Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club late last year, and its market cap has only continued to climb since.","Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club late last year, and its market value has continued to climb since. The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: Novo Nordisk Backs Away From Hims & Hers Partnership and Fiserv Connecting Thousands of Banks to Crypto with New Stablecoin Platform.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

2025-06-19 18:05:00,Why UBS Is the Only Wirehouse to Allow Podcasting,"For years, Mitch Slater urged UBS to let its advisors launch their own shows. Now, more than 50 advisors have them.","The future is here, and it’s now available wherever you get your podcasts..For the past several years, UBS has built out its podcasting program to help its advisors launch their own shows, expand their online reach and connect with younger audiences. The initiative is designed to help advisors connect with the next generation of wealth management clients and bring in new assets, according to Mitch Slater, executive director of digital communications for the wirehouse’s national sales. A recent report found that every dollar spent on podcasting may generate an additional dollar in new revenue, and that podcasts’ ability to attract clients increases over time..“The fact is, it’s $80 trillion being moved over from my generation to the generations below,” said Slater. “If you’re not skating to where the puck is, and the puck is [phones]… we just got to get there. To me, the podcast seems to be a really great way to do this.”.READ ALSO: What’s Going on With Muni Bonds? and What the GENIUS Act Means for Stablecoins and Advisors.Podcasting in general is in its heyday, with the number of Americans who listened to one in the past month jumping to 158 million in 2025 from 135 million a year earlier, according to data from Backlinko. More than half of the US population are now monthly listeners, an important fact to consider amid the Great Wealth Transfer, Slater said..UBS is the only wirehouse that lets its advisors market their businesses via podcast, Slater said, adding that every episode, before it gets uploaded to Apple Podcasts or Spotify, is subject to regulatory approval based on the Series 9, 10 and 24 exams advisors take. Although only about 1% of UBS’s advisor workforce — roughly 60 out of 6,000 advisors — are podcasting, he expects the venture to expand quickly and said there are another 10 to 15 podcasts in the works. UBS now has dozens of podcasts that speak to such niches, including:.“Lightning in a Bottle,” a podcast led by the UBS advisors Josh Pottinger and Jason Chirogianis, which focuses on how advisors can monetize their ownership positions..“Huvane Wealth Management Conversations,” another show led by a New York-based UBS team, which focuses on portfolio strategies, taxes, next-gen investors and sustainable investing..But First, Lemme Take a Selfie (Video). Slater is also involved with the firm’s “selfie video program,” in which advisors learn how to film themselves vertically, primarily for LinkedIn. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, he said, the videos helped calm nervous clients. “Everyone has to have some form of marketing,” Slater said. “Whether it’s podcasts, whether it’s videos, whether it’s a better LinkedIn engagement program — there’s something that’s right for everybody.”.This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has disappointed investors this year.,"Apple's valuation has nosedived this year as it has fallen behind its peers on next-gen technologies..The company's researchers aren't convinced that generative artificial intelligence can reason like humans..The business has struggled to generate much growth in recent quarters..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has disappointed investors this year. It has delayed some artificial intelligence (AI) features for its iPhones until next year, and that has resulted in a lot of bearishness around the business as there are rival phones with advanced AI capabilities already available..Shares of Apple are down more than 21% thus far in 2025 (as of June 13), with its valuation dipping below the $3 trillion mark..AI is a hot topic these days, with consumers seeking the latest tech on their phones to help with many day-to-day tasks. However, Apple recently published a report about AI that could shed some light as to why it may not be leading the charge and investing as heavily in next-gen technologies as other tech companies..Researchers at Apple have been testing multiple AI reasoning models, and while they have seen that they can perform better than standard models, they fail as tasks become more complex..As a result, the researchers believe that there are limits to the reasoning that AI can achieve, and they don't appear to be as convinced of its abilities as the general public. They found that the models couldn't follow steps in complex tasks and appeared to rely heavily on the familiarity of data, as opposed to applying advanced reasoning skills..AI chatbots have become more sophisticated because they have been trained on existing data, but the ability for them to truly reason like humans is by no means a certainty. If Apple isn't convinced of the potential that AI possesses, that may be part of the reason it hasn't been investing as heavily in these types of technologies as its peers..Whether or not AI can reason like a human doesn't excuse the fact that Apple has fallen well behind other companies in terms of innovation. While Apple has made changes to the look and feel of its icons with its Liquid Glass design, the company's newest iPhones haven't given consumers a compelling reason to upgrade their devices. Apple's product sales over the six-month period ending March 29 have totaled $166.7 billion -- up just 2% from the same period last year. And iPhone revenue during that stretch was nearly unchanged.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/real-reason-apple-far-behind-085000525.html

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are dominant tech firms with millions of loyal customers. If you have $1,000 to invest right now, these are excellent stocks to anchor a well-diversified portfolio..Berkshire has held a stake in the leading e-commerce and cloud computing provider since 2019. Amazon has multiple high-margin revenue streams that make it a solid investment for a long-term investor. The stock has returned 66% over the last five years and should continue to grow in value..Amazon's e-commerce and cloud services form a potent combination. It's important to understand that e-commerce is the largest revenue driver, totaling 38% of the company's $650 billion of trailing-12-month revenue, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) generates most of the company's $71 billion of trailing operating profit..AWS is seeing strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) services for enterprises, but Amazon is also leveraging this technology for its e-commerce business..For example, the company uses AI to forecast demand for products and allocate its inventory where it is needed most. This ultimately leads to faster delivery speeds, satisfied customers, and greater cost efficiencies that benefit profit margin..Amazon's operating income increased 20% year over year in the first quarter.

It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer discretionary business, boasting an average operating of 30.1%. This was especially robust given its large hardware revenue component..A company’s ROIC, or return on invested capital, shows how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity)..We like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company’s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Fortunately, Apple’s ROIC has increased significantly over the last few years. This is a great sign when paired with its already strong returns. It could suggest its competitive advantage or profitable growth opportunities are expanding..Long-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for big tech companies, a stretched historical view may miss emerging trends in AI.

The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the business services sector, averaging 27.9% over the last five years. The divergence from its underwhelming operating margin stems from the add-back of non-cash charges like depreciation and stock-based compensation.

A U.S. federal appeals court has tossed out a $300 million jury verdict that found Apple liable for infringing wireless patents held by Optis Wireless Technology. The court flagged a key flaw in how the trial judge bundled all the patents into a single infringement questionstripping Apple of its right to a unanimous jury decision on each individual claim. As a result, the case now heads back to Texas for yet another trial, covering both infringement and damages..The battle dates back to 2019, when Optis sued Apple over LTE standard-essential patents used in iPhones and other devices. The original jury handed down a $506 million verdict. That was later reduced to $300 million in a retrialonly for the latest ruling to wipe the slate clean again. Meanwhile, Optis isn't backing down. The firm insists its patents are critical for high-speed connectivity and says it remains highly confident that the court will eventually recognize their value. Apple hasn't responded publicly to this latest development..But that's not the only front where Apple is fighting. Just last month, a UK court separately ruled that Apple owes Optis $502 million for violating similar patentsa decision the company plans to appeal. While Apple's win this week could ease near-term legal pressure in the U.S., the broader IP battle is far from resolved.

TI says it’s working with the Trump administration to help produce the critical chips that power everything from smartphones to data centers and cars domestically. It’s part of the White House’s push to keep the United States ahead of China in the technology industry while promoting American manufacturing..TI, which partners with tech and auto giants like Apple, Nvidia and Ford, claims this is the “largest investment in foundational semiconductor manufacturing in US history.”.“President Trump has made it a priority to increase semiconductor manufacturing in America – including these foundational semiconductors that go into the electronics that people use every day,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a press release. “Our partnership with TI will support US chip manufacturing for decades to come.”.The announcement marks the latest major planned investment in the United States by an American company as Trump pushes industries like tech to onshore more production. Earlier this month, General Motors said it would invest $4 billion to increase US production. Apple said in February that it would invest $500 billion to expand its US facilities.

Chief among them: How the company plans to manufacture a smartphone in America in the first place..According to Trump Mobile, the T1 Phone will be available in September. But experts are throwing cold water on the idea that the device can be built in the US by that time, or even within the coming years..IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said the T1 will likely be based on an existing phone manufactured overseas..“Smartphones are not like you decide to print a few more T-shirts or a few [types of] other merchandise,” Jeronimo told Yahoo Finance. “They are complex products. So first, I doubt they are manufacturing or building phones themselves.”.“This looks like a typical white label product that you go to change and buy it from someone, put the logo on top, but that's it,” he said..Counterpoint Research analyst Blake Przesmicki offered a similar assessment of the T1 phone, saying in an email that it “is likely that this device will be initially produced by a Chinese [original device manufacturer].”.Todd Weaver is the developer of Purism’s Liberty Phone, a privacy-centric smartphone that uses US-built electronics. Weaver it took his company years to set up the facilities and source the necessary components to ensure the phone’s processing and communications features all come from America..“There’s a lot of challenges, many years, to even get to the scale that we’re at, which is only thousands of phones and not hundreds of thousands of phones,” he told Yahoo Finance..In an interview with conservative YouTube personality Benny Johnson, Eric Trump held up what he claimed was a golden Trump phone, though it struck more than a passing resemblance to an iPhone..Trump later added that “eventually all the phones can be built in the United States of America.”.Yahoo Finance reached out to Trump Mobile for clarification on the phone’s origins but didn’t receive a response by deadline..The Trump Mobile site lists the T1 Phone as sporting a 6.8-inch AMOLED display and 256GB of storage. The company also oddly lists its RAM as 12GB of storage. RAM and storage are different forms of memory..The phone will also come with a triple lens, set up with a 50MP main camera, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro lens.

Management cited growth in the iPhone, Mac, and iPad lines, along with an all-time high in Services revenue. CEO Tim Cook pointed to new product launches, including the iPhone 16e and M4-powered MacBook Air, as key contributors. However, he acknowledged that headwinds—such as shifting supply chain dynamics and the impact of tariffs—were top of mind, stating, “For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory.”.Is now the time to buy AAPL?

The probes are widely expected to result in levies on a range of foreign-made products in those industries..President Donald Trump is already using that authority, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, to impose import taxes on steel and aluminum he launched in 2018. Recently, he’s widened the scope by targeting consumer goods that contain the metals..By one estimate from Michigan State University, Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, currently set at 50%, are hitting almost $200 billion worth of steel, aluminum and household items such as fishing reels and brooms — nearly quadruple the amount during his first term..The effort comes as Trump’s April tariffs on major trading partners stand on shakier legal ground, with the Supreme Court asked on Tuesday to consider striking them down. Some administration officials believe the 232 levies could effectively supplant the country-by-country duties that have drawn legal scrutiny and bogged down negotiations with US allies and adversaries alike trying to strike deals..Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner at Wiley Rein and former senior Commerce official during Trump’s first term, said the 232 measures are shaping up to amount to “something close to global tariffs.”.“These 232 actions are very likely going to result in import restrictions on almost every good entering the US, and the size and scale of these restrictions will be so massive because China’s distortion has been so massive,” she added..Speaking to reporters this week while returning from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said pharmaceutical tariffs will be coming “very soon” and they will encourage companies to reshore production. “It’s going to bring most of them back into, at least partially back in,” he said..The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment..The latest example of Trump’s wider targeting under his 232 powers came last week when the Commerce Department announced that 50% duties on steel and aluminum products would be expanded to cover home appliances including dishwashers, dryers and washing machines. All of those items are deemed vital to national security under the law Trump invoked to impose duties.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-flexes-security-powers-keep-040001084.html

2025-06-18 16:46:00,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple,"Amazon's recent stock performance and growth are much better than Apple's.  Apple seems to be stronger financially and has a more attractive valuation than Amazon.  Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed more than 220,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997.","Amazon's recent stock performance and growth are much better than Apple's..Apple seems to be stronger financially and has a more attractive valuation than Amazon..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Two of the largest companies on the planet have also been among the biggest winners for investors over the years. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed more than 220,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) share price has soared more than 59,000% since its IPO in 1980..However, accolades achieved in previous decades don't necessarily translate to future success. Just ask Blockbuster Video or Blackberry..Which is the best stock to buy right now -- Amazon or Apple? Here's how the two stocks stack up against each other..If you're a fan of momentum trading, Amazon will probably be more to your liking than Apple. Sure, shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant tumbled earlier in the year over concerns about President Trump's tariffs. However, Amazon has been on a roll since late April, jumping nearly 30%..What about Apple? The story isn't as positive. Apple stock also fell sharply over tariff worries. Although shares of the iPhone maker have rebounded somewhat, they remain down around 20% year to date..Unsurprisingly, both Amazon and Apple are strong financially. Deciding which company is stronger, though, might depend on the financial metric you prioritize the most..For example, Amazon has a larger cash position. Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as of March 31, 2025, totaled over $94.5 billion. By comparison, Apple reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $48.5 billion, as of March 29, 2025..However, Amazon also has a larger debt load of $157.9 billion, compared to $98.2 billion for Apple. If you focus more on net cash position adjusted for debt, Apple comes out on top..One of the best measures of financial strength, in my opinion, is how much free cash flow a company generates. Apple's free cash flow over the last 12 months totaled $98.5 billion, much higher than Amazon's free cash flow of $25.9 billion..Amazon is the clear leader when it comes to recent growth. In its most recent quarter, the company's revenue increased by 9% year over year and earnings soared 64% year over year. Apple's growth pales in comparison. The consumer-tech giant's revenue and earnings increased by around 5% year over year in its latest quarter..Both Amazon and Apple could have solid growth prospects in the future. Amazon's cloud unit should remain a key growth driver for the company as organizations build and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models in the cloud. The company also continues to expand into new areas, such as healthcare and satellite internet services. Apple is reportedly developing smart glasses, a new product that could potentially ignite sales growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-amazon-084600832.html

Buffett rarely invests in tech stocks, but he has made some exceptions for quality names like Apple and Amazon.  There is another tech giant ticking almost all of Buffett's boxes right now, and it's a clear leader in the AI industry.","Warren Buffett's simple investing strategy has steered Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns for six decades..Buffett rarely invests in tech stocks, but he has made some exceptions for quality names like Apple and Amazon..There is another tech giant ticking almost all of Buffett's boxes right now, and it's a clear leader in the AI industry..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.In May, Warren Buffett announced that he plans to step down from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) at the end of 2025. It will cap off a spectacular run of success that dates back to 1965 -- though his journey isn't over completely, because he will continue to serve as chairman of Berkshire's board..Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock when Buffett took the helm 60 years ago and held on for that entire time, you'd have been sitting on shares worth an eye-popping $44.7 million at the end of 2024. The same investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period. Part of that growth came from the dozens of businesses that the conglomerate purchased in their entirety over the years, but the rest was driven by the incredible stock-picking of Buffett and his team..Buffett uses a simple strategy, and as a general rule, he tends to avoid buying shares of companies whose businesses he doesn't understand. As a result, he doesn't invest in technology stocks very often, and he certainly doesn't chase hot trends like artificial intelligence (AI)..However, there is one AI stock that could be a great fit in Berkshire's portfolio because it meets most of Buffett's investment criteria, and he has even expressed regret for not investing in it during its early years..Buffett is a value investor who likes to buy good companies when they are trading cheap, but he doesn't shy away from picking up shares of spectacular companies at a fair price..When considering a potential investment, Buffett looks for companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams. He also likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback programs. But time is Buffett's most important weapon because compound growth amplifies his results over the long term -- he has often been quoted as saying his preferred holding period is forever..Buffett oversees numerous wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, including Duracell, Dairy Queen, and GEICO Insurance. But he also helps manage its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, which currently includes holdings in 38 companies and is worth around $278 billion today. As I mentioned earlier, he generally avoids technology stocks like those in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but he has made exceptions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-isnt-081600959.html

The company is also the market leader in InfiniBand networking equipment, the leading connectivity technology for back-end AI networks..Importantly, Nvidia has struggled with two headwinds throughout the year.

However, its revenue growth over the past few years has been modest, while much of its stock gains have come from multiple expansions, as its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been increasing..The company also appears to have fallen behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, with Apple Intelligence features reportedly consistently running into delays. In addition, some high-gross-margin revenue from a revenue-sharing agreement that allows Google to be the exclusive search engine for Safari on Apple devices is at risk after Alphabet lost an antitrust trial where the agreement was at the center of the case. While the company likely wouldn't lose all of this revenue, there is a risk that some of it would go away if it gave users the option to choose their default search engine..Against this background, the upside for Apple may be limited over the next several years, opening the door for other companies to become larger than Apple. Let's look at two companies that could exceed Apple's market cap in the next five years..With a market cap of roughly $2.3 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is well-positioned to overtake Apple in size over the next few years. The company is the market-share leader in two important segments: e-commerce and cloud computing. And while Apple has lagged on the AI front, Amazon has gone all in, incorporating AI throughout its businesses to help make them more efficient and drive growth..Its e-commerce business has settled into being a high single-digit, low double-digit percentage revenue grower. The segment is seeing strong margin expansion and operating leverage, which are powering profitability growth. Its high-gross margin, sponsored-ad business is playing a big part, with revenue climbing 19% year over year last quarter to $13.9 billion..Amazon is also seeing a lot of operational efficiencies. The company now incorporates AI throughout its warehouse and logistics operations to improve efficiencies and lower costs. It is developing AI-powered robots that can perform multiple tasks and even detect damaged items, helping the company save money on labor and costly returns. Meanwhile, it's using AI in its logistics business to help drivers save time and fuel by planning better routes and helping them more easily locate hard-to-find addresses in places like large apartment complexes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-thatll-worth-074500784.html
2025-06-18 15:15:00,Apple WWDC25 – Enhancing ecosystem value over single AI agent,Apple’s WWDC25 was about enhancing its user interface with AI capabilities instead of a singular agentic experience. It steered clear of Siri and seems to have learned from its marketing snafus of 2024.,"Apple maintained a subdued tone during its WWDC 2025 announcements, focusing on what it excels at: simplifying user interfaces (UI) for everyday interactions and enhancing the seamless integration and consistent appearance of its devices across various platforms..Key highlights from the event included the adoption of a streamlined operating system (OS) naming convention that aligns with the current year (iOS 26, iPadOS 26, etc.), enhancements to continuity features throughout its ecosystem, the unveiling of a new design aesthetic termed Liquid Glass across products (a Vision Pro feature), and incremental advancements in Apple Intelligence..Apple Intelligence was peppered throughout the announcements. The company acknowledged the need for additional time to meet its quality standards – the nonchalant manner of the announcement reflected Apple's confidence in its ongoing development, despite recent discussions around AI advancements in the industry. This approach may also serve as a strategy to deflect unwelcome inquiries following the critical scrutiny Apple Intelligence has faced from the tech media. Among the notable AI features showcased were the new Live Translate function, which leverages on-device intelligence, Visual Intelligence capabilities, and a contextual search feature called Spotlight, exclusive to MacBook users..The most significant updates were for iPadOS 26, which now offers improved multitasking capabilities, including the ability to resize windows, and AI-driven features such as Live Translation in iPhone, FaceTime, and Messages. Apple appears to be diminishing the distinction between iPads and MacBooks with its new windowing system, Mac-like controls, and a menu bar. This enhancement renders the iPad experience more potent and versatile, potentially obscuring the traditional demarcation between the two devices, especially the iPad Pro and the MacBook Air. This convergence may lead to a degree of cannibalization between the two product lines, however..Apple has changed its UI for the first time since iOS 7 launched 12 years ago. Liquid Glass, a Vision Pro UI aesthetic, stands out for its unique design, which leverages the optical properties of glass to create a visually striking, slightly raised UI icons. The update to Liquid Glass is not merely a cosmetic change but a move to modernise Apple's OS..This modernisation seems to be laying the groundwork for compatibility with future devices, such as AR glasses. These glasses overlay an enhanced, or ‘elevated’ UI onto the real-world environment, suggesting Apple's potential foray into this sector.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-wwdc25-enhancing-ecosystem-value-071546946.html

When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L).

It was the first time Taiwanese officials have used that blacklist to sanction major Chinese firms, taking a cue from a longstanding US approach of blocking access to advanced technologies..The move also marks Taipei’s first public action on semiconductor restrictions since President Lai Ching-te pledged in April to address unspecified concerns from Washington about export controls. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, people familiar with the matter said, with a particular focus on enforcement of existing curbs. They requested anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly..A congressional committee focused on China, meanwhile, said after Taipei’s move that the US “must continue working with our partners to ensure the CCP’s attempts to illegally transfer tech are stopped cold.”.Taipei’s decision may be the first of a series of measures tightening the flow of technology to China, marking a departure from a policy of nurturing cross-Strait business ties. The longer-term goal may be to throttle supply of the vital components, silicon materials and plant construction expertise that helped transform Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. into the world’s most advanced chip operation..“This recent shift marks a substantive move toward strategic technological competition with China,” said Chiang Min-yen, an analyst at Taiwan’s government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology. “Compared to other tech democracies with similar industrial structures — such as Japan and South Korea — Taiwan is now taking a more decisive stance.”.Lai didn’t specify in his April comments what steps Taiwan would take in response to US concerns, but instead described a broader strategy to boost trade relations with the US.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else..“Hard-working Americans deserve a wireless service that’s affordable, reflects their values, and delivers reliable quality they can count on,” Eric Trump said in a statement..So, where does this leave Apple (AAPL)? Is the Trump family’s entrance into the mobile phone market a cause for concern for AAPL investors?.Make no mistake, Apple has problems, and some of them are Trump-centric. The president made his displeasure particularly clear with Apple’s plans to move production of most of the iPhones used in the United States to India, remarking about CEO Tim Cook, “I said to him, ‘my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India.’ I don’t want you building in India.”.Apple has pledged to invest $500 billion across the United States over the coming four years, including through building an advanced server manufacturing hub in Texas. These initiatives are expected to help mitigate Apple’s exposure to tariffs while simultaneously generating political goodwill through localized production..At the same time, Apple has stepped up its efforts to diversify its manufacturing footprint. As of the second quarter of its fiscal 2025, around half of the iPhones intended for U.S. consumers are now assembled in India, which is an outcome of a notable strategic shift. In addition, a substantial share of iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods for the American market are now manufactured in Vietnam..As for the potential challenge posed by Trump Mobile, Apple appears well-insulated. With a global installed base of more than 2 billion active devices, a brand identity that is unrivaled in the tech world, and a deeply integrated ecosystem that creates substantial user lock-in, it is hard to envision a scenario where a nascent competitor like T1 Mobile poses any meaningful disruption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-family-betting-big-mobile-202734808.html
2025-06-18 02:21:00,Is ARM's 22% Plummet Over a Year Offering a Fair Price for the Stock?,"Arm Holdings' 22% stock decline, cooling China growth and soaring valuation raise fresh questions about its upside potential.","Arm Holdings plc ARM stock has declined significantly over the past year. Shares have declined 22% against the industry’s 4.3% growth..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Considering the current weakness of ARM shares, investors may wonder if now is the right time to invest in the stock. Let’s delve deeper..ARM’s core strength in power-efficient chip architecture remains central to its leadership in mobile computing. Its designs power sleek, energy-saving devices from Apple AAPL, Qualcomm QCOM, and Samsung, making ARM the foundation of today’s mobile innovation. As demand for performance on minimal power rises, Arm Holdings’ chips continue to dominate smartphones and tablets..Apple leverages ARM’s architecture for its M-series chips, while Qualcomm depends on it to power its Snapdragon lineup. Samsung integrates ARM designs across mobile and consumer electronics, further affirming its critical role. ARM’s proven ability to balance high efficiency and low power draw has solidified its status in the mobile era..ARM is rapidly emerging as a foundational player in the age of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). As Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung pursue AI-driven innovation, they increasingly rely on ARM’s flexible, energy-efficient architecture. AI models are being embedded into everything from wearables to cloud data centers, and ARM’s chips are built to meet these growing demands..Apple continues to scale its AI integration on ARM-based silicon, Qualcomm expands its AI capabilities in mobile and automotive, and Samsung explores next-gen IoT through Exynos chips powered by ARM. With machine learning and edge computing at the forefront, ARM is becoming an indispensable infrastructure for the next wave of tech advancement..ARM faces notable risks due to its significant exposure to China, its second-largest market. Growth in the region has been sluggish, and one potential reason is the rising adoption of RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture increasingly favored by Chinese firms. This trend may soon accelerate, as the Chinese government is preparing to issue formal guidelines aimed at promoting the development and widespread use of RISC-V technology. Such state-backed support could further weaken ARM’s position in the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem over the coming years..Given China's strategic focus on reducing dependence on foreign chip architectures, Arm’s reliance on this market presents a long-term concern. If RISC-V adoption continues to gain traction, Arm Holdings’ growth prospects in China could remain muted, affecting its broader global momentum. These evolving competitive dynamic highlights a key vulnerability in Arm’s business model that investors should closely monitor.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arms-22-plummet-over-offering-172100731.html

2025-06-17 23:59:00,BABA Down 8% in a Month: Will Partnership With Apple Aid Recovery?,Alibaba faces regulatory headwinds despite Apple AI progress. Mixed Q4 results suggest holding existing positions or waiting for better entry points in fiscal 2026.,"Alibaba Group's BABA shares have lost 8.2% over the past month, underperforming the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry and the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, thus reflecting investor uncertainty despite progress in the company's AI partnership with Apple. The Chinese e-commerce and cloud computing giant recently released versions of its Qwen3 AI models for Apple's MLX architecture, enabling compatibility with iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and Mac computers. This development represents a significant step toward bringing Apple Intelligence features to the Chinese market, though regulatory headwinds continue to cloud the partnership's future..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The technical integration of Alibaba's AI models with Apple devices marks meaningful progress in their collaboration to deliver AI-powered features to Chinese consumers. Apple Intelligence encompasses various AI tools, including Genmoji and Writing Tools, which require local partnership to comply with Chinese regulations. The partnership has gained strategic importance as Apple's iPhone sales captured the top position in China during May, with global sales rising 15% year over year in April and May according to Counterpoint Research data.However, the collaboration faces mounting pressure from U.S. officials who have been scrutinizing the arrangement. Reports indicate that White House and congressional officials are examining Apple's plans to integrate Alibaba's AI technology into iPhones sold in China, reflecting broader tensions in U.S.-China technology relations. This scrutiny introduces uncertainty about the partnership's timeline and ultimate implementation, potentially affecting both companies' strategic plans in the crucial Chinese market..Alibaba's fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results presented a mixed picture that disappointed investors. Total revenues reached RMB 236.5 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth, though this figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.49%. The company's adjusted EBITA showed stronger performance with 36% year-over-year growth to RMB 32.6 billion, indicating operational efficiency improvements.The Taobao and Tmall Group demonstrated resilience with customer management revenues growing 12% year over year, primarily driven by improved take rates. Meanwhile, the Cloud Intelligence Group accelerated growth to 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This cloud performance underscores the potential value of the Apple partnership, though regulatory uncertainties may limit near-term benefits.However, various business segments showed mixed results, with some areas like Cainiao Smart Logistics experiencing revenue declines due to operational restructuring.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicates a downward revision of 1.5% over the past 60 days to $10.62 per share, the market appears to be pessimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baba-down-8-month-partnership-155900688.html

The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint earlier this year, and the judge found the new arguments sufficient to deny Apple’s request to dismiss the case..The plaintiffs claim that Apple holds a monopoly in the cloud-based storage market for iPhones, both in terms of revenue and user numbers..For context, Apple lets users of its devices back up data like photos, videos, and other documents from their devices to any cloud storage service of their choice, but users can’t backup devices’ core data to these services, nor restore them..In its motion to dismiss, Apple defended its decision to limit third-party cloud apps from accessing core data, including app data and device settings, citing security reasons..“That design decision was and always has been a feature grounded in security and privacy considerations, given the sensitivity of the data required to restore one’s Apple device,” the company wrote..Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-court-denies-apple-request-121820223.html

But now it is not expected before 2028, one of the sources said, who added that real, sustainable demand is non-existent for an electric sports car..The source said low market interest would also give Ferrari time to further develop in-house technology for its second electric vehicle, although soft demand remained the main reason for the delay..Ferrari declined to comment..Both sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter..Ferrari has announced long-term plans to sell EVs and Reuters previously reported Ferrari has a second EV model under development, but the carmaker has not publicly disclosed any plans beyond its first EV..Other sports car makers have already postponed or scaled back their electric ambitions because of a lack of consumer interest..Ferrari's Italian rival Lamborghini, a unit of Volkswagen, said in December it will launch its first electric model in 2029 instead of 2028 and Germany's Porsche cut back its plans for EVs amid soft sales of its electric Macan SUV and Taycan models..Earlier this year Maserati, the luxury brand of Stellantis (STLA), cancelled plans for an electric version of its MC20 sports car..The plan for a second Ferrari EV has been delayed twice by the Maranello, Italy-based company. Initially there was a one-year postponement, but now the model will launch in 2028 at the earliest, the second source said, adding that demand for high-performance is currently ""zero""..The source said that internally, Ferrari's second electric car is seen as the real game changer for its EV strategy, while the first one is more of a low-volume, symbolic milestone model that will meet its promise to launch its first EV in 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-ferrari-delays-second-ev-103255850.html

Warren Buffett, as chairman, has helped Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio grow to more than $258 billion -- and it's even beaten the S&P 500 index along the way.  Berkshire Hathway has delivered a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over 59 years, while the benchmark has registered a 10% gain over that time period.","Buffett hasn’t been known to invest in the latest hot technologies, but you still can apply his techniques to tech investing..The investing giant has delivered market-beating gains for nearly 60 years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Warren Buffett, as chairman, has helped Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio grow to more than $258 billion -- and it's even beaten the S&P 500 index along the way. Berkshire Hathway has delivered a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over 59 years, while the benchmark has registered a 10% gain over that time period. This isn't thanks to investing in the latest technologies or hot trends but rather to choosing a variety of quality companies in often slower-moving industries, such as consumer goods or financial services..But this doesn't mean you can't apply Buffett's techniques and investing principles to an area he wouldn't necessarily dive into today, such as artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, it's a fantastic idea to consider AI stocks that fit Buffett's playbook, as we know that elements this top investor looks for often lead to investing success..Now the ironic thing about the following two stocks is they actually are ones Buffett owns. But it's key to point out he didn't buy them as AI investments -- he picked up shares of each well before the AI boom -- and I wouldn't expect Buffett to scoop up any stock as an AI bet just yet. But if the billionaire were to change his mind and start shopping for AI players, he probably would add to his holdings of the following two companies..Several years ago, before Buffett picked up Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares, the investing giant said he regretted passing on the stock earlier on. He said he hadn't imagined it was possible to build such an e-commerce empire. Shortly after making those comments, in 2019, one of Buffett's managers added Amazon shares to the portfolio, and the rest is history..Buffett may have bought Amazon for its leading e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses, and today these strong businesses continue to make Amazon a great buy. But on top of this, Amazon is also winning in AI: The company has applied AI tools to its operations to gain in efficiency, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells AI products and services to AI customers..Why is Amazon a Buffett-style buy?

Starbucks Corp. is sounding out interest in its business in the country, where it has over 7,750 outlets. Sporting goods retailer Decathlon SA has started a process to sell about 30% of its China business..Reasons for this shift include the fierce competition from Chinese companies, which have evolved into nimble and sophisticated rivals with a deep connection to local consumers. Iconic brands including Apple Inc. and Nike Inc. face intensifying rivalries with local names such as Huawei Technologies Co., Xiaomi Corp., Anta Sports Products Ltd. and Li Ning Co..The economic malaise in the wake of Covid has also affected spending habits..“Multinationals face competition from local rivals and shifting demands, especially younger generations prioritizing value for money and emotional resonance,” said Chen Jie, global head of mergers and acquisitions at China International Capital Corp. “To survive and succeed, they must develop localized strategies.”.Häagen-Dazs and Starbucks have both introduced products catering more directly to the local market, such as specialty Lunar New Year mooncake ice creams and braised pork flavored latte. Starbucks, feeling the heat from rapidly rising homegrown chains like Luckin Coffee Inc., also recently announced price cuts in China on tea-based and Frappuccino beverages, a strategy that contrasts with its US operations, where it is streamlining its menu to emphasize coffee..McDonald’s Corp.’s China menu includes offerings such as congee and luncheon meat burgers, while Yum China Holdings Inc., which operates KFC and Pizza Hut, has egg tarts, Peking duck-style wraps and durian pizzas in addition to its more traditional fare..Even with decades of experience in China under their belts, international firms are considering fresh partnerships to help weather today’s challenges.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/h-agen-dazs-starbucks-mull-064929200.html

A year ago, the stock had a market capitalization of just $53 million. This is despite the company having a net loss of $4.4 million for its fiscal year that ended June 2024, a 28% decrease from the previous year..Earlier this month the company said its board approved a 38-for-1 stock split.

Its traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, which forms the basis of its product candidates, “contains only natural ingredients without any synthetic components.”.“We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable,” the company said in an October filing..The company also made its foray into treatments for Covid-19, conducting trials in 2022 for an “holistic approach” with its experimental therapy. Regencell said data from a 2022 trial showed the treatment was effective in reducing and eliminating Covid symptoms within six days, although the results were yet to be peer-reviewed..The firm has funded its operations so far, primarily from shareholder loans and proceeds from its initial public offering, the SEC filing showed.

Last week, Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, whose leader is joining a team being assembled by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to pursue artificial general intelligence. That came just after Meta raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as much as $72 billion..“The amount of spending might give some pause, but we’re confident Meta can use AI to drive revenue and accelerate growth,” said Jake Seltz, who manages the Allspring LT Large Growth ETF. “This shows Meta is committed to making the investments it needs to maintain its leadership, and while the stock has had a nice run, we’re still bullish on the long-term opportunity.”.Shares rose 2.6% on Monday. Earlier, the company said it would begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service..Meta’s rally has coincided with a resurgence in trader appetites for AI-related stocks, after the earnings season alleviated fears that Big Tech companies might rein in spending on expensive computing gear. The rebound marks a shift from earlier in the year, when stocks such as Nvidia Corp. tumbled on concerns about AI models developed on the cheap in China..An exchange traded fund that tracks AI stocks including Amazon.com Inc. is up 32% from a low on April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on trading partners, sparking a broad relief rally in stocks.

He also cited improved operational efficiencies and the shift away from the so-called metaverse, which prompted the company to change its name from Facebook in 2021..“Using AI to optimize the data it has on users for revenue is a clear application, one that allows Meta to play offense while Alphabet is playing defense,” Bond said, referring to concerns that the Google parent could lose market share in the lucrative search business to AI services like ChatGPT. “While AI is expensive, there is good evidence that it is really paying off so far.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-cheer-zuckerberg-doubles-101644156.html
2025-06-16 21:40:00,Why reviving U.S. tech manufacturing is harder than you think,Trump’s wrecking ball to global trade has already proved too fast and too disruptive to encourage companies like Apple to quickly move their production to the U.S.,"“Millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones. That kind of this is going to come to America.”.That was U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s pitch in April for the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, the most radical shift in U.S. trade policy since the 1930s..The administration has used many rationales for tariffs, but the one that seems to animate the president most is a wish to bring manufacturing back home to the U.S. Over the past few decades, many industries including tech have shipped most of their production overseas, where wages are lower, skilled labor is easier to find, and suppliers are more plentiful..But reversing the status quo for companies like Apple is far more complicated than Trump lets on, if it’s possible at all. Behind a finished smartphone extends a chain of suppliers and assemblers, particularly in Asia, that is difficult to replace..Trump’s wrecking ball to global trade has already proved too fast and too disruptive to encourage companies like Apple to quickly move their production to the U.S. Instead, to bring U.S. manufacturing back, Washington will need a more targeted, more methodical— and more stable—strategy, according to economists and experts who have spent years, if not decades, studying trade and global supply chains..“There is no single industrial policy tool which will do this alone. It takes a whole ecosystem,” says Marc Fasteau, coauthor of Industrial Policy for the United States: Winning the Competition for Good Jobs and High-Value Industries..Over the past several decades, manufacturing has steadily declined as a share of U.S. GDP, from around 25% in the 1950s to 10% today. Meanwhile, in Asian manufacturing powerhouses like China, Japan, and South Korea, the proportion has grown higher than 20%..China, in particular, has captured much of the world’s manufacturing, thanks to a massive pool of skilled labor and deeply integrated supply chains. Countless industries—toys and household goods, consumer electronics, and even bespoke products—rely on Chinese factories..“There’s this deep ecosystem of hundreds, if not thousands, of suppliers and sub-suppliers. You have amazing logistics within the country and then through the ports to the rest of the world,” says Dexter Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at U.S. think tank Atlantic Council..Also in China’s favor is that it has an “order of magnitude” more manufacturing workers (105 million) than the U.S. (13 million), notes Dan Wang, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. Additionally, China has installed over half of the world’s industrial robots compared with the U.S.’s share of just 7%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-reviving-u-tech-manufacturing-134039558.html

A $1.5 billion partnership to build golf courses, hotels and real estate projects in Vietnam was approved last month, though the deal was in the works before Trump was elected..Trump has already used the main regulatory agency that will oversee Trump Mobile in personal disputes..The Federal Communications Commission has launched investigations of media outlets Trump dislikes and, in some cases, is personally suing. And the president himself last month criticized cell phone maker Apple, now a big business rival, because it planned to make most of its U.S. iPhones in India, threatening to slap a 25% tariff on the devices..Eric Trump said that consumers deserve a phone that aligns with their values..“Hard-working Americans deserve a wireless service that’s affordable, reflects their values, and delivers reliable quality they can count on,” he said in a statement..The Trump phone deal comes as a mandatory financial disclosure report just filed with the government shows the president has moved fast in the last year to profit off his celebrity, taking in $3 million in revenue from selling “Save America” coffee table books, $2.8 million from Trump watches and $2.5 million from Trump branded sneakers and fragrances..The Trump Organization on Monday said the new, gold-colored phone available for $499 in August, called the T1 Phone, won’t be designed or made by Trump Mobile, but by another company..The Trump Organization did not respond to repeated requests for more details on that and comment..IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said the monthly fee of just under $50 is pricey, the appeal beyond the most ardent MAGA loyalists doubtful and the business difficult given that cell phones break down.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-family-announces-another-venture-124459622.html

Now options traders are signaling that they see the pricey cohort as especially vulnerable to another round of trade war-driven volatility..Most Read from Bloomberg.As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space.As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage.The cost of protecting against a correction in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, is climbing with less than a month to go until Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs potentially ends. On Friday, the relative price of hedging against a 10% decline in the ETF, compared with a similar rally, hit its highest level since early April..The growing skepticism toward the megacap rally shows investors are well aware of the risks, should trade tensions flare again and reignite worries around the US economic outlook. The tech behemoths fell harder than the broad market during the early April turmoil, and some investors see a threat that it could happen again..“Right now, high valuations, and to some extent economic impacts of the tariffs, are still worries,” Rocky Fishman, founder of research firm Asym 500, said in an interview..Helped by a positive earnings season, a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven — Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — has rallied 31% since April 8, the day before Trump paused most of his harshest tariffs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index is up 20%..Besides trade-war fears, there are other reasons for concern about the group, such as the amount of cash they’re throwing at artificial intelligence. That spending is fueling concerns about profit margins, and investors have high expectations that those expenditures will pay off..High valuations present another worry. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven gauge is trading at 29 times projected profits, above a 10-year average of 28. That compares with the S&P 500’s forward multiple of 22..Earlier this month, Needham analysts downgraded Apple’s stock to a hold rating, warning that the company’s valuation looks “expensive on several metrics.” They also cited the iPhone maker’s vulnerability to US tariffs..The uptick in demand for hedges underscores investor doubts about the staying power of the current rally, Fishman said..“With these reluctant rallies, where people don’t feel too excited and they just see the market keep on going up, then you start seeing investors getting nervous about giving up the gains they’ve picked up,” said Fishman.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-furious-rally-forces-093000399.html

Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) operates some of the most powerful and most cost-efficient data center infrastructure in the world for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Demand is significantly exceeding available supply, as some of the industry's top developers are lining up around the block to use it..Oracle had a market capitalization of $600 billion, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a whopping 65% return if it climbs into the $1 trillion club. Here's why I think it will..Every new generation of AI model requires more computing capacity than the last. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says some of the latest ""reasoning"" models -- which spend more time before rendering a response to produce more accurate information -- use up to 1,000 times more computing power than traditional large language models (LLMs), which specialize in crafting one-shot responses..That computing capacity is delivered by enormous data centers that are filled with graphics processing units (GPUs) from top chip suppliers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Most businesses don't have the financial resources to build this infrastructure themselves, so they rent it from companies like Oracle that operate centralized data centers situated all over the world..Oracle's Gen2 Cloud data centers allow developers to scale up to 131,072 of Nvidia's industry-leading Blackwell GB200 GPUs, paving the way for the most powerful AI models to date. Plus, Oracle's infrastructure uses a proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology, which moves data from one point to another faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, so speedy processing can translate into substantial cost savings.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-stock-could-join-081500959.html
2025-06-16 16:00:00,Why RCS is gaining traction among business and consumers alike,"Rich communication services ""is an app-like experience in the messaging channel,” said Brenda Fackler, VP of client services at Sinch. “It is a total game changer.”","This story was originally published on CX Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CX Dive newsletter. .A majority of business leaders say RCS, or rich communication services, will be game-changing for business messaging, according to a Sinch report released Monday. Sinch surveyed 2,800 consumers globally and more than 1,600 business leaders..Nearly 9 in 10 business leaders are at least somewhat familiar with RCS, the survey found. RCS is a richer form of text messaging that allows for better conversational abilities and richer visuals. It even lets customers take next actions within the same channel. .“RCS is an app-like experience in the messaging channel. It is a total game changer,” Brenda Fackler, VP of client services at Sinch. “The conversational abilities of RCS really do start to create an experience that centers on the customer.”.RCS is becoming more popular among businesses and customers alike. .More than 4 in 5 consumers prefer RCS over traditional text messaging, according to a Twilio survey released earlier this month. Three-quarters of businesses plan to invest in RCS in 2025..Apple instigated the recent surge in popularity, according to Fackler. While the technology has been used on Android devices for a while, in October, Apple announced its support of RCS. .""It's been around for a long time, but it was really Apple's announcement that they were going to support the format that changed things,” Fackler said. “They started making beta versions available that people could get in and play around with. With roughly 50% of the market, that just made a huge difference.”.One of the biggest advantages of RCS is security. First, businesses go through a verification process. The consumer then receives a message from a verified sender and logo. Messages are also encrypted in transit, making it more secure than SMS..Nearly half of business leaders believe RCS will improve security, but they also expect it to increase customer engagement and trust. .Some of the features of RCS are simply practical. When a customer receives a message from a business using RCS, it also comes with a virtual contact card, or V card, so customers can further engage..“Not only is it branded, named, but you can also have a phone number, have a link to download the app,” Fackler said. Such information “isn't sexy, but it's incredibly pragmatic and powerful.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-rcs-gaining-traction-among-080000067.html

And this problem weighed most heavily on stocks that depend on growth and investment -- such as those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI)..These particular players led indexes higher over the past two years on optimism about spending and the technology's potential, but they lost momentum in March and April. Since, though, the U.S. has made progress on trade talks, and this has lifted market sentiment. Meanwhile, tech companies' earnings reports show no signs of a slowdown in AI spending..This has spurred new gains in AI stocks, and if the U.S. trade situation resolves without excessively high tariffs, these players could continue to advance. With this in mind, here are my top five AI stocks to buy before the second half..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) soared more than 800% over the past two years as investors piled into this stock driving the AI revolution. The company dominates the AI chip market, and these chips are used for the most essential AI tasks. Nvidia hasn't had to wait to benefit from the AI market. The company already has delivered double- or triple-digit growth, with revenue attaining record levels..This momentum is likely to continue as Nvidia is well positioned to power AI across every stage of development, from training through the creation of humanoid robots. I'm confident about this thanks to Nvidia's commitment to innovation -- it's already set out a calendar of chip updates through 2028. This makes it very difficult for rivals to upset its position..Now is a great time to get in on this high-potential player as it's on sale, trading for 33 times forward earnings estimates -- down from more than 50 earlier in the year..Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which sells some imported goods on its e-commerce site and also works with sellers that import goods, may benefit as trade tensions ease. The company also is winning from AI in two ways: Amazon uses AI tools to streamline operations, resulting in lower costs and greater efficiency. And Amazon, through its cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), sells AI services to customers. AI services already have helped AWS reach a $117 billion annual revenue run rate.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-ai-stocks-buy-074500596.html

It now stands on the brink of a deal that would hand it stakes in major operations in Australia and Papua New Guinea — if it can secure regulatory approvals..Santos Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher has rebuffed several approaches from peers over the last few years, and has come under fire from impatient investors. Now the board of Australia’s second-largest fossil fuel producer has recommended Adnoc’s cash offer of $5.76 (A$8.89) per share — a 28% premium to Friday’s close..“Credit to Gallagher for extracting such a premium offer – he will have earned the payout of his ensuing incentives in doing so,” Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee, said in a note. “Gallagher has found his escape parachute and it’s made of gold.”.Santos shares closed 11% higher on Monday at A$7.72 a piece. That’s the biggest daily jump since November 2020, but the stock remains shy of the Adnoc offer, in large part because of the hurdles that lie ahead, including clearance from the Australian authority that reviews foreign investments..“It’s a great price,” Fereidun Fesharaki, founder and chairman of energy consulting group FGE told Bloomberg TV. “XRG is a global entity which wants to create a lot of LNG and upstream capability inside the company. My only question is whether Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board will accept this or not, and I think it will be challenging for them to approve it. In the past they have been very reluctant to make these approvals.”.Fesharaki added that one option would be to keep the current management and Santos as an independent player. “If you can convince them that this will function as an Australian company with foreign ownership, they might go along with it,” he added..A spokesman for the Treasury Department said in a statement that foreign investment matters are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure they aren’t contrary to national interest or security.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adnoc-makes-19-billion-takeover-015430686.html

When asked whether Trump or Xi would be a better partner for Australia, the two leaders were tied at 45% apiece..The results come as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attends a Group of Seven meeting in Canada, where he could hold his first face-to-face meeting with the US president. Albanese will be hoping to negotiate an exemption on US steel and aluminum tariffs for Australia, as well as trying to secure Trump’s support for Aukus following the announcement in Washington of a review of the security accord..Albanese’s balancing act with Trump is a difficult one.

AI could be a game-changer for countless industries and will likely create new market opportunities in the process..Currently, most of Wall Street has focused on companies like Nvidia, which are selling billions of dollars worth of chips and hardware for AI data centers..Eventually, though, AI will move beyond its hyperfocus on data centers into the real world, and that presents a huge market opportunity that investors are only just beginning to position their portfolios for..Three Motley Fool analysts put their heads together. They arrived at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), and Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) as technology leaders in excellent position to capitalize on AI tailwinds that could drive growth for years to come. Here is what you need to know..Justin Pope (Apple): Smartphones have become handheld computers, the central technology hub for people living their daily lives. It makes Apple a clear favorite as AI software becomes increasingly integrated into society..The company's iOS mobile operating system spans phones, accessories, watches, tablets, and computers that all work seamlessly together, creating a formidable competitive moat..In other words, the more iOS devices you use, the more of a pain it is to abandon the system for something else. Today, that iOS user base spans 2.35 billion devices. It's the perfect distribution network for AI software. But it has become evident that the company's first attempt at AI, Apple Intelligence, hasn't gone off with a bang..Fortunately for Apple, its system's stickiness gives the iPhone maker room for error that most brands don't have. There's a solid chance that the company will eventually work out these kinks and deploy its consumer-facing AI technology across billions of devices, whether smartphones or other device using its far-reaching iOS platform.

He has also said that he won't invest in businesses that he understands. So, does that mean the legendary investor doesn't own any AI stocks? Nope..Actually, Buffett has invested roughly $90 billion in nine companies that are heavily focused on AI. Here they are -- and which one is the best of the bunch..Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker is valued at close to $59.3 billion. Although Buffett significantly reduced the conglomerate's position in Apple last year, it still makes up 21% of Berkshire's total portfolio..AI has been at the forefront of Apple's development strategy for years. However, the company was seemingly left behind in the generative AI race until it launched Apple Intelligence in 2024. So far, though, Apple Intelligence doesn't appear to be igniting the super-cycle of iPhone upgrades that some analysts predicted..Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is another top AI stock in Berkshire's portfolio, albeit a much smaller one. Berkshire owns around $2.1 billion of the e-commerce and cloud service giant's shares. Buffett didn't make the initial decision to buy Amazon; one of Berkshire's other investment managers (either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler) bought the stock..Most AI models run in the cloud. As the largest cloud services provider in the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a big winner as organizations scrambled to build and deploy AI models in the cloud. Amazon is also using AI extensively internally to increase efficiency and provide more services to customers..Apple and Amazon are the only AI stocks owned directly by Berkshire Hathaway.

On June 10, following Apple’s keynote at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reaffirmed his Outperform rating on the stock, along with a $270 price target..In his post-event note, Ives noted that while the presentation outlined Apple’s vision for the developer ecosystem, it offered limited new detail on the company’s artificial intelligence initiatives, an area where Apple appears to be moving cautiously, likely in response to last year’s strategic missteps..A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers..Notably, at the WWDC 2024, the company had given an ambitious roadmap to its Apple Intelligence and a transformation for smart AI assistant, Siri. However, the execution over these plans has lagged and the company’s AI strategy has been under scrutiny..Fast forwarding to now, Ives believes Apple’s measured approach is understandable, but 2025 could be a critical year for the company to begin monetizing its AI efforts more visibly. He suggested that if internal development does not accelerate, the company may need to explore larger-scale AI acquisitions to strengthen its positioning in the space..Although Apple may be seen as entering the AI race later than peers, Ives acknowledged that the company has begun laying the groundwork for a longer-term strategy. In his view, WWDC marked the start of Apple’s multi-year AI roadmap, with initial steps that could shape its direction through 2026 and beyond..Apple Inc.

Here are three reasons why the sell-off in Apple has gone far enough, and why the beaten-down growth stock could be a great buy for the second half of 2025.","Apple's latest offerings and announcements aren't generating excitement among investors..The company could accelerate earnings during an upgrade cycle..Apple is a fair value for an industry-leading company..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is in the bottom 10% of S&P 500 stocks when measuring year-to-date performance. The stock trades down almost 22% at the time of this writing..Here are three reasons why the sell-off in Apple has gone far enough, and why the beaten-down growth stock could be a great buy for the second half of 2025..Apple generally puts out two major product and service announcements each year. The first, known as the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), just concluded. The second is its new products unveiling, which typically happens in September..WWDC 2025 was a bit of a mixed bag, as Apple failed to make a splash with its artificial intelligence (AI)-related announcements. But there were announcements about upgrades..At WWDC 2024, Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence. At WWDC 2025, it announced new features across Apple products, allowing developers to access the company's on-device large language model (LLM). It also allows users to take what they see on their screen and leverage that visual across different applications. For example, users can engage with ChatGPT, Alphabet's Google, or shop on Etsy based on what they are viewing at a given moment. Apple Intelligence can also help translate languages through Messages, FaceTime, and on phone calls. And it can take a visual for an event and add it to the user's calendar, saving a manual entry step..Apple also unveiled a software interface update called Liquid Glass and a new operating system for many of its products called iOS 26. The software is a major design update that will impact content across all of Apple's apps and devices..Following the announcements, Apple's stock price ticked down slightly, possibly because the announcements were underwhelming compared to what competitors are doing or because folks were simply expecting more. As of Friday afternoon, Apple was down 3.8% compared to its closing price on June 6 before WWDC began..There is no shortage of criticism that Apple is behind on AI and simply isn't innovating enough. But Apple is in a different position than other companies because it is mainly consumer-facing. Apple makes sophisticated and elegantly designed products that pair with a suite of services -- including Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Card, iCloud, and more. Apple wants to avoid releasing software updates that overwhelm factions of its user base, making AI updates that are difficult to navigate, or releasing a design feature that isn't received well.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-beaten-down-094500237.html

Apple has also become a reliable dividend payer since restarting payouts in 2012.","Apple renewed its dividend in 2012..The company produces plenty of free cash to support dividends..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.When people think about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), products like the iPhone likely come to mind. But long-time investors probably think more about the company's stock, which has rewarded shareholders with a 532% appreciation over the last 10 years through June 9. That's easily outpaced the S&P 500 index's 189% gain..Apple has also become a reliable dividend payer since restarting payouts in 2012. It's good to know that the board of directors has committed to making regular payouts. It's particularly useful if you're targeting a specific annual total, such as $1,000..First, it's essential to check on whether Apple can support the current dividend. Fortunately, the company produces plenty of free cash flow (FCF) that should give investors confidence..In the first six months of the current fiscal year, which ended on March 29, Apple's FCF totaled $47.9 billion, and it paid out $7.6 billion in dividends..Now that we've confirmed Apple's ability to sustain its dividends, it's time to turn to the number of shares needed to produce $1,000 in yearly dividends..Apple raised its May quarterly dividend by a penny to $0.26 per share. While the board of directors has a history of annual increases, it's prudent to take a conservative approach and assume the dividend remains constant. Should the company continue to boost payouts, you'll receive more than $1,000 annually..Multiplying the quarterly dividend by four works out to an annual dividend payment of $1.04 a share. To receive $1,000, you'd have to purchase 962 shares. Using the June 9 closing price of $201.45, those shares will cost about $194,000..It's nice to receive secure dividends.

We have lots for you this week, including what came out of WWDC 2025; The Browser Company’s AI browser; OpenAI’s partnership with Mattel; and updates to your iPad. Have a great weekend!.The Apple experience: We kicked the week off with WWDC 2025, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company showed off a newly designed iOS 26, new features across its products, and much more. There was considerable pressure on Apple this year to build on its promises and to make amends to developers as it lags behind in AI and faces continued legal challenges over its App Store..Snack hack: U.S. grocery distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) was hit by a cyberattack, the company confirmed Tuesday. Much of UNFI’s external-facing systems were offline, including web systems used by suppliers and customers, as well as the company’s VPN products. Whole Foods was one of the victims, and it told staff that the cyberattack was affecting UNFI’s “ability to select and ship products from their warehouses” and that this will “impact our normal delivery schedules and product availability.”.Public debut: Chime’s much-anticipated public debut finally arrived, with the company raising $864 million in its IPO. Iconiq was one of Chime’s many backers taking a victory lap at its graduation to become a public company..This is TechCrunch’s Week in Review, where we recap the week’s biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here..Not to be outdone: Google rolled out Android 16 to Pixel phones, adding group chat to RCS, AI-powered edit suggestions to Google Photos, and support for corporate badges in Google Wallet..Cabs are here: Elon Musk has spent years claiming that Teslas would be able to drive themselves. Apparently the time has come — maybe? Musk said this week that Tesla will start offering public rides in driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, on June 22..An AI browser: The Browser Company said last year that it’s going to stop supporting and developing its Arc browser, which, although popular, was never able to reach scale. The startup has since been busy developing an AI-first browser called Dia..And another one: OpenAI released o3-pro, which is a version of o3, a reasoning model that the startup launched earlier this year. As opposed to conventional AI models, reasoning models work through problems step by step, allowing them to perform more reliably in domains like physics, math, and coding. In other news, Sam Altman posted on X to say that his company’s first open model in years will be delayed until later this summer.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/week-review-wwdc-2025-recap-170800689.html

Previously, only the app’s name, subtitle, and keyword list would count towards its search ranking, it said..The conclusion that screenshots are informing app discoverability is accurate, based on what Apple announced at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC 25), but the way Apple is extracting that data involves AI, not OCR techniques, as Appfigures had guessed..At its annual developer conference, Apple explained that screenshots and other metadata would be used to help improve an app’s discoverability. The company said it’s using AI techniques to extract information that would otherwise be buried in an app’s description, its category information, its screenshots, or other metadata, for example. That also means that developers shouldn’t need to add keywords to the screenshots or take other steps to influence the tags..At WWDC, Apple says it will use AI to tag apps to improve discoverability on the App Store.This allows Apple to assign a tag to better categorize the app. Ultimately, developers would be able to control which of these AI-assigned tags would be associated with their apps, the company said..Plus, Apple assured developers that humans would review the tags before they went live..In time, it will be important for developers to better understand tags and which ones will help their app get discovered, when the tags reach global App Store users.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/app-store-ai-generated-tags-160149577.html

This technological shift – though seemingly small – enables quantum computers to process information millions of times faster than today’s most advanced supercomputers..IONQ is at the forefront of this radical technology..You can see above the stock took a 55% dive since the beginning of the year, only to shoot more than 100% higher from that low, bringing its year-to-date return to 15%…before subsequently dropping again to where it is today..Earlier this week you may have seen a story highlighting how Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes quantum computing is at an “inflection point.” Huang said Wednesday that “we are within reach” of using quantum computers for “areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years.”.This caused IONQ to turn north again. Quantum computing may indeed be the future, but as you can see, the ride to future profits is going to be bumpy..Not unlike the chart showing the realistic pathway to success..But you don’t have to endure the market gyrations blindly.

That’s where, rumor has it, folks got the first look at a product called Lisa..InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips.We now know this was the world’s first personal computer with a graphic interface..The point is Apple’s history is filled with game-changing products and software. And each June, millions of folks watch the WWDC with bated breath, hoping to catch a glimpse of the future..The press also speculates for weeks. And Wall Street… well, it does what it does best. It reacts..But here’s the thing….For all the flashy presentations, the breathless hype, and the dramatic camera pans – it’s often what’s not said that matters most..In fact, I’ll go ahead and pose the question that’s on everyone’s mind:.Is Apple losing the artificial intelligence race?.See, last year Apple made its long-awaited entry into the AI arms race. The company debuted Apple Intelligence, teasing features like visual search, live translation, image generation, and more..But the reality is, these were hardly game-changing innovations..Sure, there were a lot of buzzwords thrown around. There was vague talk of “neural engines” and “machine learning.” But when Apple Intelligence rolled out? There was no ChatGPT killer. No groundbreaking AI system. No bold vision. Just some nice features that other competitors already had, plus some enhanced privacy features..Twelve months later, Tim Cook and company returned to the stage. Would Apple finally deliver the goods? Were they finally ready to compete with OpenAI, Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), or NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)? Could they match the breakthroughs pouring out of Silicon Valley’s real AI leaders?.The short answer: no..In today’s Market360, let’s break down what Apple actually delivered at this year’s WWDC – what impressed me, what fell flat… and where the smart money should really be focused next..This year’s WWDC was packed with updates – many of them aimed at giving developers new tools to build smarter, more personalized apps using Apple’s homegrown AI tech..But the fact is none of these are game changers on their own. Instead, Apple offered minor upgrades disguised as innovation:.Live Translation: Real-time translations in Messages and FaceTime—good for privacy, but far from revolutionary..Visual Intelligence: Screen analysis tools that can identify objects and suggest actions.

These three options meet the mark, though.","Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have led the S&P 500 higher over the last two and a half years..These three stocks trade at relatively low valuations compared to other high-flying AI stocks..They each have meaningful upside across the board, from AI software to hardware to chip manufacturing..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most-talked-about topics on Wall Street over the last two and a half years. More than 40% of S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) companies have cited ""AI"" on their earnings calls for five straight quarters, according to FactSet Insight. Practically every business is looking at how the recent innovations and influx of spending on AI can impact just about every aspect of their business..But while AI is providing a ton of growth for some, it can be a cost center without a clear payoff for others. However, even if a company falls into the former camp, investors should be wary about overpaying for growth that could slow down as the business scales..Finding good value in AI stocks isn't easy. And if you have a limited investment budget, like $200, you'll want to make sure you're only buying the best available options..These three companies all have stocks that trade for less than $200 per share and offer excellent value for the growth potential ahead of them. All three are benefiting from the growth of AI and should play important roles in the future development of artificial intelligence and computing from here..Many investors are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence on Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) core Google Search product. Apple's Eddy Cue testified that search queries were down on its Safari browser during the month of April for the first time in 22 years, supporting the idea that AI services like ChatGPT are eating into its market share..But a decline in searches on a single browser, while surprising, isn't too concerning. AI is a bigger boost to Alphabet than a challenge. It's seen great success with its AI Overviews in search queries, which management says increase engagement while monetizing at the same level as traditional search results. It's also leveraged AI to offer new features like circle-to-search and Google Lens, which overindex toward valuable product searches..Artificial intelligence has been a massive driver of growth for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. It saw revenue climb 28% in the first quarter, with its operating margin expanding from 9.4% to 17.8%. Management said it remains supply-constrained, so strong revenue growth should continue. On top of that, Google's bigger cloud computing competitors sport even higher operating margins, so there's room to expand profits as it scales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-095500655.html

But Apple could go further.","This week, Apple previewed its redesigned (and renumbered) operating systems at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

Here are three of my favorite ones coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac—and three missed opportunities..With iOS 18 and macOS 15 last year, Apple introduced the Passwords app—the one-stop app for managing all your passwords. The app was Apple’s first attempt at a standalone password manager, and it provided a robust set of management tools, including the ability to autocomplete 2FA codes, share passwords with family and friends, and even organize your passkeys..In iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, Apple is adding a new feature to the Passwords app. It will allow you to see the previous passwords you’ve saved for any given website, along with the date you changed the password. It’s an especially useful feature for websites that require you to change your password periodically and do not allow you to reuse a previously used password. Now, you’ll be able to quickly glance at the past passwords you’ve used for the site and easily choose an alternate one..While the iPhone, iPad, and Mac are among the gadgets with the best security protections built in, bad actors are becoming more clever in finding ways to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating systems they target. A common way these bad actors can infect your device with malware is by using a one-click attack. This is when the threat actor texts you a link, which you then click on. You may think this link is innocuous, but really the moment you clicked on it, it allowed the attacker to access data on your phone..Bad actors know that many people will click on links that are texted to them, even from unknown senders. But now in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, when the operating system suspects you’ve received a spam text, it will silo that text into a dedicated spam folder and convert the link to plain text—meaning it won’t be clickable.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-just-made-3-great-090000325.html

The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.41, signifying a 0.71% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $88.31 billion, showing a 2.95% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter..Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $7.11 per share and revenue of $404.19 billion, indicating changes of +5.33% and +3.36%, respectively, compared to the previous year..Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple should also be noted by investors.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..This shift comes as Apple looks to de-risk from China ahead of what could be another round of sweeping tariffs. Donald Trump has floated a 55% duty on Chinese goods and slammed Apple's expansion into India, reportedly telling CEO Tim Cook, We are not interested in you building in India. India, meanwhile, is trying to dodge a separate 26% reciprocal tariff on top of its standard 10%. With the stakes this high, Apple's move to reroute its supply chain through India could be less about costand more about survival. It's also about time.

2025-06-14 02:00:00,Apple’s Liquid Glass design is paving the way for AR glasses,"This visual overhaul gives us a glimpse into the design of Apple's rumored AR glasses, which will reportedly debut next year.","At Apple’s WWDC 2025 event, the company announced its most dramatic software design change in over a decade: Liquid Glass. This visual overhaul gives us a glimpse into what might be coming in Apple’s rumored AR glasses, which will reportedly debut next year..Users are connecting Liquid Glass to potential AR glasses because the new design draws strong inspiration from that of Apple’s Vision Pro VR headset..Liquid Glass is named with the idea that each window on a phone is like a pane of glass, see-through and somewhat reflective. It gives the screen a sleeker look, though in its developer beta, Apple hasn’t quite worked out the kinks of playing with opacity..The Vision Pro wasn’t much of a commercial success — it cost $3,500, and unlike a computer, it isn’t something that has proven essential for our lives. But nonetheless, the UX design of the Vision Pro is impressive because it makes wearing a headset feel a bit less disorienting..It can feel unnatural to be so immersed in virtual reality for an extended period of time, so Apple took advantage of its mixed reality capabilities by overlaying windows atop a user’s real-world surroundings, rather than a synthetic background..Apple may not be able to convince people that they need a $3,500 headset, but to keep up with competitors like Meta’s Ray-Bans and Google’s renewed attempt at smart glasses, Apple needs to enter the arena of this lighter hardware. And one of Apple’s strengths as a company — something that sets it apart from Meta and Google — is that it’s known for elegant, modern designs (except for “the notch“)..According to reports from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, these glasses would have cameras, microphones, and speakers like its competitors. Siri — which is still awaiting its own makeover — would be built-in, and could assist with taking phone calls, playing music, live translation, and turn-by-turn directions. On a display, users would be able to see notifications, pictures, and other overlays..If that’s the case, then Apple will need to master the style of these somewhat transparent design elements. If you’re wearing AR glasses and get some form of notification, you’d probably rather see that as something that blends into your surroundings, and not some giant colorful box that suddenly obscures your vision while you’re walking around..We don’t know much about the rumored Apple AR glasses yet, but we’d be willing to bet we’ll see Liquid Glass in them.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-liquid-glass-design-paving-180015528.html

The lawsuit, targeting their alleged suppression of lawful competition in standalone Wi-Fi Calling, comes amidst Apple's introduction of several updates across its product lines, including significant enhancements in iPadOS, iOS, and macOS. Despite these developments, Apple's share price moved by a modest 2% last week. This reflects the broader market dynamics, including the Dow's significant decline due to geopolitical tensions, demonstrating that Apple's movement aligns with wider market trends rather than being solely driven by company-specific events..Be aware that Apple is showing 1 possible red flag in our investment analysis..Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value..Apple’s recent legal challenge from VoIP-Pal.com Inc. could impact its operational focus and financial metrics. While the lawsuit's direct effects are yet to be fully realized, it might introduce legal costs and potential changes in business practices that could affect revenue and earnings forecasts. Specifically, if Apple were to face adverse rulings, it may have to adjust its business practices or pricing, potentially impacting service revenue streams. The market's reaction, with only a modest share price movement, suggests that the impact might not be deemed significant unless more developments arise..Over a longer five-year period, Apple has delivered a total return of 134.39%, significantly rewarding its shareholders. This context highlights a strong performance, even if, in the last year, the stock underperformed the US market, which returned 11.7%. This discrepancy raises questions about recent pressures on the stock compared to broader market dynamics..The current share price movement should also be evaluated in light of analyst price targets, which are approximately 14.5% higher than the present value. This discount signals that analysts might expect Apple to navigate current challenges and achieve its growth targets. Such a target anticipates that planned U.S. facility expansions and new product launches, such as the iPhone 16e, will drive revenue and earnings growth. However, the broader macroeconomic conditions and legal outcomes are potential uncertainties..Evaluate Apple's historical performance by accessing our past performance report..

Investor reaction was tepid, with shares dipping modestly last week as expectations around Apple Intelligence went unmet..Unlike peers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (GOOG), Apple has not signalled large-scale AI infrastructure investments.

2025-06-14 00:27:00,Is Roku's Strategy for Devices Segment Holding Back Its Profitability?,"ROKU's Devices arm fuels user growth but drags on margins, despite strong unit sales and strategic importance.","Roku’s ROKU Devices segment remains a challenging part of the business, acting more as a strategic tool to grow its user base than as a source of profitability. While devices are essential for expanding Roku-powered households, the segment continues to face financial strain, with persistent losses and margin pressure. Roku maintains that its priority is growing its streaming footprint, even at the cost of short-term Devices profits.These trends are expected to continue. For the second quarter of 2025, Roku projects Devices revenues to decline around 10% year over year, with margins staying negative. To manage macro and tariff-related risks, the company is leaning on its diversified manufacturing and flexible pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roku’s second quarter 2025 revenues of the Devices segment is pegged at $124.42 million and the estimate for the gross loss of the segment is pegged at $14.06 million.To improve brand appeal and deepen engagement, Roku recently launched a refreshed device lineup. The updated Roku-made TVs feature better picture and sound quality, faster app launches and deeper bass. The new Pro Series introduces QLED and Mini-LED technology, along with an upgraded Voice Remote Pro and software features like Smart Picture and personalized Backdrops.Despite similar efforts in the past, profitability remains elusive. In the first quarter of 2025, Devices revenues rose 11% year over year to $140 million (13.7% of total revenues), but the segment posted a gross loss of $19 million and a negative 14% margin due to lingering holiday promotions. While unit sales were strong, the Devices business continues to function as a long-term strategic lever rather than a near-term profit engine..Several players are competing with Roku’s devices business, with companies like Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL offering alternative streaming hardware and expanding their user ecosystems.Amazon continues to expand its Fire TV lineup, combining affordability with Alexa integration to drive adoption. Amazon’s Fire TV devices remain a key part of its strategy to increase engagement within its content and services ecosystem.Apple’s premium Apple TV 4K appeals to users seeking a high-performance experience with seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem. Apple continues to attract loyal users through tight ecosystem linkages and exclusive content..ROKU shares have gained 10.3% in the trailing three months, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s return of 22% but underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 10.6%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rokus-strategy-devices-segment-holding-162700306.html
2025-06-13 22:18:00,This 1999 email from a tech pioneer helped me think about Apple’s WWDC,"Jef Raskin instigated the Mac project in 1979. Twenty years later, he was dismayed with the state of personal computing. What would he think today?","In 1999, I got to work on a literally once-in-a-lifetime project. As the 20th century was wrapping up, the magazine where I worked declared the personal computer the most important invention of the last 100 years. It wasn’t exactly a contrarian pick: The magazine in question was PC World..Most Read from Fast Company.Pentagon Pizza Index: The theory that surging pizza orders signal global crises.5 signals that make you instantly more trustworthy at work.What’s behind the rise in interim CEOs.To celebrate, we put together an article looking back at 100 defining moments in computing history. I was assigned to write blurbs on several of them. One was among the most obvious landmarks, Apple’s 1984 introduction of the Macintosh, which brought the graphical interface and mouse to the masses..I had a scant 250 words to recount an oft-told tale. Not wanting to merely rehash its familiar elements, I decided to focus on the Mac’s roots and emailed the guy who came up with the project in the first place, Jef Raskin..This dusty memory resurfaced in my brain this week when I read my colleague Jesus Diaz’s article about Apple’s upcoming iPadOS 26 operating system, one of the major announcements at this week’s WWDC conference. By giving the iPad a new interface with floating, overlapping windows, the software upgrade pushes the tablet far closer to the Mac. Jesus argues that the shift not only overcomplicates the iPad but also violates Raskin’s decades-old principles about how to make computing easy and intuitive..It might sound strange to say that the iPad is getting both more Maclike and more removed from the original vision of the guy who initiated the Mac project. But both facts can coexist. Apple’s 31st employee, Raskin started at the company as its publications manager. In 1979, he got the go-ahead to work on an easy-to-use computer he named—with a slight spelling modification—after his favorite kind of apple, the McIntosh. He put together a team oozing with talent, including people who would become some of the most legendary Apple staffers of all time, such as Bill Atkinson (who died last week), Burrell Smith, Bud Tribble, and Joanna Hoffman..Unfortunately for Raskin, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs not only took an interest in the Mac project but took it over. Under Jobs, the computer evolved into something only tangentially related to Raskin’s concept. After leaving Apple, Raskin oversaw the development of a short-lived machine that stuck closer to his vision, the Canon Cat. In later years, he continued exploring ways to make computing more approachable as a software designer, author, and teacher. He died in 2005.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1999-email-tech-pioneer-helped-141801279.html

Despite the patriotic enthusiasm, there’s little evidence corporate America has broken ground on new domestic facilities..“There have been anecdotal announcements from drug companies, or otherwise, talking about investments here in the US,” Brent Thielman, who covers the construction and engineering industries for DA Davidson & Co., said in an interview. “But when that comes to fruition remains to be seen.”.Altogether, companies ranging from Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. to Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars of spending in the US since Trump’s election. Many of those commitments weren’t new or were in line with previous spending patterns..Touting new projects in response to tariffs could appear reactive, while highlighting projects already underway is a savvy way to calm investors in uncertain times, said Emily Borders, chief client officer at Highwire, a public relations agency..“It’s very difficult to set up a ‘Made in the USA’ program overnight. In fact, you can’t do that,” Borders said. “However, many organizations have been doing really interesting things in that regard or have had initiatives in that regard for a while and those may not have been top of mind with some of their constituencies.”.Like some of those investment announcements, touting your domestic production bona fides could have the added benefit of keeping the heat from the White House at bay, though that’s not a certainty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-create-most-patriotic-earnings-140000385.html

This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history..Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&P 500's 2.6% gain..Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means ""the health of the broader economy is improving."".Across the S&P 500's 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU)..The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market's most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard..Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 5.32%..As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president's Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides..AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year's biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past..AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year's biggest winner in the index, rising 80%.

The appropriately named ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a nearly 6,000,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) through the closing bell on June 9. For the sake of comparison, the broad-based S&P 500's total return, including dividends, is a shade over 40,000% over the same 60-year timeline..Despite Buffett being 94 years old and planning to step down as CEO by the end of the year, investors still eagerly follow his investing activity. Riding Buffett's coattails and mirroring his trading activity has been a profitable venture for decades..But one of the most defining aspects of Warren Buffett's investment philosophy has been his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both Buffett and late right-hand man Charlie Munger believed in putting an outsized percentage of their company's invested assets to work in their best ideas..With less than seven months to go before Buffett officially cedes his long-held executive role to Greg Abel, he's wagering 72% ($203.3 billion) of Berkshire Hathaway's $283 billion of invested assets on just seven unstoppable stocks..Despite Buffett paring down 67% of Berkshire's stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since Sept. 30, 2023, it still represents the Oracle of Omaha's largest holding by a substantial amount..While Apple's calling card has often been its innovation, as well as its ongoing transformation into a higher-margin subscription-driven operating model, Buffett's investment in Apple primarily revolves around his keen understanding of consumer behaviors. Apple has an exceptionally loyal customer base, and most importantly consumers trust the brand..Additionally, Apple has the world's leading share-repurchase program. Since kicking off its buyback initiative in 2013, Apple has spent more than $750 billion to reduce its outstanding share count by 43.3%. Lowering its share count has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the company's earnings per share.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-wagering-72-berkshire-070600791.html

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. On June 10, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated an “Outperform” rating and $250.00 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)..Highlighting the recent keynote, analysts stated how it matched expectations of a transition year and that there were minimal announcements. One of the main announcements was Apple’s decision to allow developers access to its foundational AI models, which power Apple Intelligence. This permission will integrate AI features into apps that can operate independently of internet connectivity..To conclude, all the announcements were largely in line with analyst predictions before the event. This is why the keynote likely did not revise perceptions of Apple’s stock value..Here are his comments:.“The keynote was largely consistent with our preview that this would be a ‘transition year’ with relatively minor announcements. As expected, the biggest AI related announcement was Apple is opening up its on-device foundational AI models that underpin Apple Intelligence. This will enable developers to build AI features into their apps with 100% of the processing taking place on device, therefore working with or without an internet connections. The other AI announcements include deeper Visual Intelligence integration and live translate which will come to a variety of apps including messages, phone, and Facetime. It will also be available to developers via API. Apple also announced a new ‘Liquid Glass’ technology and changed the nomenclature used for its various operating systems. In addition to the ‘Liquid Glass’ changes to iOS, Apple also announced some visual changes for iOS 26, inspired by VisionOS. iPad OS will get some notable updates including some new multitasking features that will further blur the lines between MacOS and iPadOS. Apple Watch is getting a new ‘Workout Buddy’ that will offer enhanced fitness features and increases the devices lead as one of the best pieces of fitness hardware. Net/net: The announcements were consistent with our expectations heading into the event. Unlikely anything at the event changed anyone’s view on the stock.”.Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, particularly the iPhones and MacBooks..While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But this year, the highly anticipated event resulted in AAPL stock falling hard as investors reacted negatively to a disappointing update regarding one of Apple’s flagship products..💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵.When Apple software chief Craig Federighi took the stage at WWDC, he discussed the progress the company has made with Apple Intelligence, its artificial intelligence (AI) platform. But as he moved on to providing an update on Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, things quickly took a turn for the worse, as he revealed that its AI revamp isn’t coming yet..This news disappointed both Apple investors and consumers, resulting in harsh criticism from multiple financial experts..The past month has brought numerous complications for Apple, primarily from Capitol Hill. President Donald Trump has made it clear that he doesn’t want the company to build iPhones in India, despite CEO Tim Cook’s plans to invest $500 billion in manufacturing in the U.S. over the coming years..Related: Analyst has blunt words on Trump's iPhone tariff plans.Trump seems intent on strong-arming Apple into building its flagship product on U.S. soil, no matter how many experts argue that it isn’t possible, due to economic factors and a lack of labor. This list includes Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, a noted tech expert who describes Trump’s vision as a “fairy tale” with almost no chance of happening..Since the underwhelming WWDC, though, many people have sounded off, expressing their disappointment in the company’s execution and failure to innovate. Apple’s slow approach to AI isn’t news, but now it may be causing investors to lose confidence in the consumer tech leader..A well-known AAPL stock bull, Ives noted that the event revealed “slow and steady improvements"" but still described it as “overall a yawner,” highlighting the popular consensus that its lack of exciting updates is working against the company..He isn’t the only one to raise these points.

At the heart of this resurgence is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), better known as simply “TSMC”, the silent powerhouse behind the AI boom. The stock is within grasp of yet another historic high around the $225 mark..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.TSMC produces the chips that drive everything from Nvidia’s GPUs to Apple’s iPhones, and it’s now experiencing accelerated growth fueled by surging AI demand, global factory expansion, and massive capital investment. Despite its strong rebound and concerns about exuberant valuations, TSMC still appears attractively priced. Given how sharply TSM has bounced back, the stock could become the ultimate Tech play, with its best days still ahead..Many tech giants are currently riding the AI wave, but when it comes to TSMC, it’s more appropriate to say that the company is steering it. As the world’s largest contract chipmaker, it produces the advanced processors that Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Apple (AAPL) rely on to bring AI to life. In TSMC’s latest earnings call in April, CEO C.C. Wei revealed that AI chip revenue, which tripled in 2024, is expected to double again this year..This is currently a major tailwind for TSMC, driving a 41.6% year-over-year revenue surge. Specifically, advanced 3nm and 5nm chips, critical for AI’s heavy lifting, made up 73% of wafer sales. With cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) building AI data centers at breakneck speed, the company’s factories are running at full capacity, with no signs that demand is slowing down anytime soon..In the meantime, with AI entering the sphere of national security, TSMC has been incentivized to not keep its magic in Taiwan. It’s spreading its wings to secure its AI dominance and sidestep geopolitical risks. The company is investing $165 billion in U.S. factories, with Arizona’s first fab already fully booked by heavyweights like Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM). Here’s how all these giants stack up on TipRanks’ stock comparison tool:.Moreover, in Europe, a new $10 billion plant in Dresden, Germany, and a chip design center in Munich are positioning TSMC to capture the continent’s growing AI market. Beyond the motive of diversifying supply chain and hedging geopolitical risk, TSMC has managed to secure long-term, high-value contracts with global tech titans through these moves, as they, in turn, can make such commitments with notably less risk involved.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silent-giant-tsmc-returns-peak-230300515.html

The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries..Apple’s “.4” updates — known as “E” on the company’s internal software development schedule — are typically released in March. That was the case with iOS 18.4 this year and iOS 17.4 in 2024. But an exact date hasn’t been set internally for the software, beyond a spring time frame, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is private..Apple, in response to a request for comment, said it hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features. It reiterated earlier statements that the upgrades are planned for the “coming year.”.The timeline could still shift depending on whether new snags emerge. If the next several weeks of development work proves promising, the company could consider giving a preview of the features when it launches the next iPhones in the fall, one of the people said, though no final decisions have been made..The upgrade has been a long time coming. Apple originally introduced the next-generation Siri features at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June of last year. The idea was to modernize the voice assistant — first introduced in 2011 — which hasn’t kept pace with chatbots and other AI tools..The technology in the works also includes a system called App Intents that allows Siri to more precisely control applications and in-app actions across Apple devices..If the latest release timing sticks, Apple will have gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers. It’s been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year — despite the new Siri not being close to ready..Internally, Apple’s AI and marketing teams have pointed fingers at each other. The engineering side has blamed marketing for overhyping features, while marketing maintains it operated on timelines provided to them by the company’s AI teams, according to people with knowledge of the matter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-targets-spring-2026-release-204531105.html

It is not a badge of dishonor. It just isn’t.”.Firms typically engage in stock buybacks as a way of signaling confidence in their business and returning value to shareholders..Apple announced a $100 billion buyback at the start of May after reporting fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings surpassing analysts’ expectations. Typically, these types of announcements are followed by a surge in share price. But as highlighted by Cramer, this has not been the case..Trending: New to crypto? Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase..At last look, Apple’s stock price is down over 3% since announcing the buyback and down 19% year-to-date. There are several reasons for this. For one, Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the time that the company had taken a $900 million cost hit due to President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. At the same time, the announced $100 billion buyback represented a $10 billion reduction from the previous year, indicating that the company wants to retain more cash amid uncertain economic conditions..Unlike Apple’s stock, Bitcoin is up 16% since May and year-to-date. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock price has been unchanged since May but up 31% year-to-date..Still, It is unclear whether Apple will be swayed by Saylor’s proposition. In 2021, Cook admitted to owning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, stating that holding the assets made sense as part of a diversified portfolio. But he maintained that it was not something Apple was considering.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saylor-says-apple-buy-bitcoin-203104398.html

For example, it can identify a plant in a garden, tell you about a restaurant, or recognize a jacket someone is wearing..Now, the feature will be able to interact with the information on your iPhone’s screen. For instance, if you come across a post on a social media app, Visual Intelligence can conduct an image search related to what you see while browsing. The tool performs the search using Google Search, ChatGPT, and similar apps..To access Visual Intelligence, open the Control Center or customize the Action button (the same button typically used to take a screenshot). The feature becomes available with iOS 26 when it launches later this year. Read more..Apple integrated ChatGPT into Image Playground, its AI-powered image generation tool.

Apple says it has fixed the bug that was used to hack their phones..The Citizen Lab wrote in its report, shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication, that Apple had told its researchers that the flaw exploited in the attacks had been “mitigated in iOS 18.3.1,” a software update for iPhones released on February 10..Until this week, the advisory of that security update mentioned only one unrelated flaw, which allowed attackers to disable an iPhone security mechanism that makes it harder to unlock phones..On Thursday, however, Apple updated its February 10 advisory to include details about a new flaw, which was also fixed at the time but not publicized..“A logic issue existed when processing a maliciously crafted photo or video shared via an iCloud Link. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” reads the now-updated advisory..In the final version of its report published Thursday, The Citizen Lab confirmed this is the flaw used against Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed “prominent” European journalist..Do you have more information Paragon? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email..It’s unclear why Apple did not disclose the existence of this patched flaw until four months after the release of the iOS update, and an Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment seeking clarity..The Paragon spyware scandal began in January, when WhatsApp notified around 90 of its users, including journalists and human rights activists, that they had been targeted with spyware made by Paragon, dubbed Graphite..Then, at the end of April, several iPhone users received a notification from Apple alerting them that they had been the targets of mercenary spyware. The alert did not mention the spyware company behind the hacking campaign..On Thursday, The Citizen Lab published its findings confirming that two journalists who had received that Apple notification were hacked with Paragon’s spyware..It’s unclear if all the Apple users who received the notification were also targeted with Graphite.

Some examples:.A user could say, “Hey Siri, when does Mom’s flight land?” and Siri—having access to the user’s email, contacts, calendar, and files—would know the answer..Siri would also be able to “see” what’s on the user’s screen, so it could, for example, read an address from a text message and add it to a contact card..A user could tell Siri to take action within an app, such as: “Siri, take the red-eye out of this photo,” or “Send the email I drafted to Judy and Carmen.”.Cool stuff, useful, and things Apple is uniquely positioned to offer. So what happened?.Apple software chief Craig Federighi and head of marketing Greg “Joz” Joswiak offered a fuller explanation during a round of media interviews Tuesday. According to them, Apple had a working “version one” of a new Siri architecture before announcing the personal AI features at WWDC 2024. (In other words: No, the demos weren’t vaporware.) The Siri team believed they could continue polishing the product until it performed reliably enough for a late 2024 release..But Federighi explained in an interview with TechRadar that the system continued to generate too many unreliable results in internal testing. When a year-end release became unrealistic, the team aimed for spring 2025. But by then, the system was still inconsistent. That’s when the Siri team concluded it would need to create a “version two” of the new Siri architecture—one that “extends across the entire Siri experience.” Until that reworked Siri is performing reliably in-house, Federighi said, the company won’t speculate on a public release date.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-fumbled-personal-ai-debut-160000321.html
2025-06-12 23:37:00,Your iPad is your new computer,"Apple's upcoming iPadOS 26 makes the iPad function more like a MacBook, rather than a giant iPhone, making it a boon for productivity.","After its WWDC 2025 event, Apple described its upcoming iPadOS 26 update as “the biggest iPadOS release ever.” This doesn’t seem like it’s just a self-aggrandizing exaggeration — iPadOS 26 could actually change the way we think about the utility of a 15-year-old product that has long felt like an oversized iPhone designed for a cyclops..The new OS brings us multi-tasking tools, a new windowing system, and the Preview app, which may not sound as alluring as “Liquid Glass.” But if you’ve ever tried to have a productive workday via iPad, then this news is more exciting than Sabrina Carpenter’s new album announcement (and that’s not just because her new song was kinda mid)..As it stands now, you can only have two windows open at once on the iPad, and navigating between the two windows is kind of a nightmare. If you’re trying to write an email while also looking at your calendar to confirm that you’re giving your co-worker a good time to call you, then you’ll probably be toggling the two windows back and forth, struggling to see all of the relevant information. It’s kind of a mess, and a big reason why I never work on my iPad (despite having spent over $100 on Logitech’s detachable keyboard…).If I have to refer to any sources during the writing process — whether that be a press release, interview notes, an email, a research paper, or, god forbid, all of the above — then I might as well just pull my phone out as a second tiny screen. Let’s just say, it isn’t the most user-friendly experience..With the new window controls in iPadOS 26, you can see all of your open windows at once, then tile them intuitively to help you multitask. These window controls are also compatible with Stage Manager, which lets you organize your windows into specific environments. As a result, iPadOS is removing its older multitasking features, Split View and Slide Over..Meanwhile, the iPad’s new Preview app makes it possible to edit and view PDFs natively, including features like AutoFill and Apple Pencil compatibility..Like Mac products, iPad apps will now get a menu bar, which makes it easier to locate specific commands or features within an app. Developers also have access to customizing the menu bar in their own apps..And if you often work with folders, you can pin them to your dock, rather than navigating through a clunky Files app..There’s more to the new OS than these quality-of-life features (which, frankly, could’ve been shipped a while ago). Given the computing power of Apple’s silicon chips, iPadOS 26 can perform high-intensity background tasks like exporting a video, allowing you to keep working while waiting for the export to complete.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ipad-computer-153707214.html
2025-06-12 23:05:00,'Mag 7' turned 'Mid 7': Is 2025 the end of tech dominance?,"The tech sector (XLK), specifically the ""Magnificent Seven,"" made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), was a significant driver of market gains in 2023 and 2024.

Nvidia trading near record highs as tech per usual big driver of the market's push higher. The tech sector, is it poised to remain the market leader? That's the big question. Our very own Josh Schafer joins us now at the desk. You've been digging into this and this leadership that we've seen from tech in this rally. .Yeah, Brad, so I mean, you have the S&P 500 back near record highs, of course, Nvidia also back near record highs, as you mentioned, right? And so the question I've sort of been posing the strategist over the last week is, okay, well, if we go higher, what takes us higher, right? What's sort of this next leg of the bull market? And I think it's interesting because you sort of hear both sides of this trade, right? Like the folks over at City, they just moved up their S&P 500 target to 6300. They're still talking about growth is defensive. You think about a lot of these companies, Nvidia would probably be included in that, maybe an Apple, all really all of them, right? Are cash rich businesses, they're businesses that can do well if rates stay higher. But what I thought was interesting, different take from Richard Bernstein over at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He had a note out calling it the mid seven. .Mhm. .And so when I talked to Richard, he highlighted this chart. Uh this is the percent of stocks that have outperformed the S&P 500. Of course, those two little lines you see over the last two years are 2023 and 2024, right? That was your mag seven led rally. Well, pick your head up. Stocks outside of the mag seven have been doing very well thus far in 2025, right? You've seen a lot of outperformance from a lot of the other sectors. I think seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are outperforming the index. And so Bernstein sort of making the point that as growth slows for that mag seven cohort. Yes, the earnings year of year growth is still strong, but it is slowing, right? That rate of change is coming down. That might make the case for perhaps some more of the 493 and some other areas of the market to be areas where you can you can play. .I I just didn't expect from mid seven the Gen Z vernacular to make its way into a Richard Bernstein analysis here. It's mid right now. .It's mid. Sometimes it's just mid, Brad. .You know, as we talk about that leadership, Adil, what are you anticipating from the mag seven, especially as we're looking for this diversification within portfolios right now? .Yeah, so we we do think that these companies will continue to do well because what happens is that there's a lot of expenditure that is going into artificial intelligence. There's a lot of government policy that is supporting artificial. There's deregulation also happening. And that makes us believe that because of the productivity that these companies are bringing about because of AI related productivity, that's going to cause GDP to increase as well. So we do think that the mag seven will continue to do well, but one of the problems we see, we deal with a lot of retail investors. One of the problems we see is that people are like overly concentrated in the mag seven. You know, like they'll have 60 to 70% of their portfolio in tech related investments. That's where we want to put the personal finance hat on, and we want to say that this can be treacherous. Make sure you're broad because to your point, there are a lot of other sectors that are doing really well. AI doesn't mean that only mag seven will do well. There are other sectors that could do well also. .Has that rebalancing started to happen among clients yet? Because I feel like April was maybe a wake up or February to April was a little bit of a wake up call, right? Those a lot of those stocks got hammered pretty significantly, but then you had the strong come up really over the last month and a half now. Are clients starting to really wonder like, okay, should I rebalance here? Did I just hold Nvidia? Did really well, and now it's too big in the portfolio? .Well, there's this is where the behavioral finance comes in as well because, you know, people don't want to sell Nvidia like they love it, right? So and we've been where others were being aggressive end of last year, we were being defensive. We were saying all right, you know, take a pause, take a step back, right size your exposure to these companies, increase the breadth of your portfolio. So we have been doing it, but I do feel that the ordinary retail investor that is having a do it yourself approach is overexposed there. Uh if you look at the S&P 500 by itself, that's more than 40% in tech right now. And if you add a few other technology companies in the portfolio, now you're 50, 60% in tech, right? That's the ordinary retail investor that has a do it yourself approach. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mag-7-turned-mid-7-150505452.html

Undeterred by an eye-watering cost to borrow that’s hit about 150% of the stock price, there are plenty of traders willing to bet against CoreWeave, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics..“A lot of new guys think this new price level is an extraordinarily attractive short,” Dusaniwsky said. “Shorts are staying in because they believe the expected P&L more than offsets the financing costs.”.Borrow fees, which are annualized, are typically much lower for most other stocks. Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc., for example, both have borrow fees of less than 1%..CoreWeave’s heavy spending and the run up in its shares have made the company a popular target for short sellers, who borrow a stock and sell it with the aim of buying it back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. The bears have gotten some relief from a two-day slump this week, but CoreWeave shares gained as much as 3.4% in early trading on Thursday after a report that the firm won new business from Google..CoreWeave rents cloud computing capacity to customers like Microsoft Corp. and is expanding rapidly amid brisk demand for AI infrastructure. However, that growth requires a lot of investment, which prompted CoreWeave last month to forecast capital spending of as much as $23 billion in its current fiscal year. The company is projected to lose $934 million this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg..Felix Wang, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, recommended shorting CoreWeave in April and has watched in disbelief as the stock has pushed higher. Still, Wang is sticking with his call and remains skeptical that CoreWeave will be able to obtain larger, new multi-year contracts in the coming years..“My belief is that there is no path forward on them reaching profitability in at least a few years and losses will continue to go higher and higher,” he said in an interview. “It’s hard, but I’m trying to screen out the noise and the meme volatility.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-shorts-face-150-borrow-133523404.html

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too.","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed lower on Wednesday as investors continued to digest announcements from this week's Worldwide Developers Conference..The much-anticipated event showcased updates across Apple's operating systems, including a new design language called ""Liquid Glass,"" but left some analysts and investors underwhelmed by its advancements in artificial intelligence..With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year)..To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months)..Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / 1.04 = 5,769 shares..So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,146,762 worth of Apple, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500..Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $229,392 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100..View more earnings on AAPL.Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time..The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change..For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60)..Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40)..Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease..AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell by 1.9% to close at $198.78 on Wednesday...Read More: .Top 2 Consumer Stocks That May Plunge In June.Photo: Akhenaton Images/Shutterstock.Up Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

2025-06-12 20:00:00,Researchers confirm two journalists were hacked with Paragon spyware,"The confirmation of two hacked victims further deepens an ongoing spyware scandal that, for now, appears largely focused on the Italian government.","Two European journalists were hacked using government spyware made by Israeli surveillance tech provider Paragon, new research has confirmed..On Thursday, digital rights group The Citizen Lab published a new report detailing the results of a new forensic investigation into the iPhones of Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed “prominent” European journalist. The researchers said both journalists were hacked by the same Paragon customer, based on evidence found on the two journalists’ devices..Until now, there was no evidence that Pellegrino, who works for online news website Fanpage, had been either targeted or hacked with Paragon spyware. When he was alerted by Apple at the end of April, the notification referred to a mercenary spyware attack, but did not specifically mention Paragon, nor whether his phone had been infected with the spyware..The confirmation of the first-ever known Paragon infections further deepens an ongoing spyware scandal that, for now, appears to be mostly focused on the use of spyware by the Italian government, but could expand to include other countries in Europe..These new revelations come months after WhatsApp first notified around 90 of its users in over two dozen countries in Europe and beyond, including journalists, that they had been targeted with Paragon spyware, known as Graphite. Among those targeted were several Italians, including Pellegrino’s colleague and Fanpage director Francesco Cancellato, as well as nonprofit workers who help rescue migrants at sea..Last week, Italy’s parliamentary committee known as COPASIR, which oversees the country’s intelligence agencies’ activities, published a report that said it found no evidence that Cancellato was spied on. The report, which confirmed that Italy’s internal and external intelligence agencies AISI and AISE were Paragon customers, made no mention of Pellegrino..The Citizen Lab’s new report puts into question COPASIR’s conclusions..“A week ago it seemed like Italy was putting this scandal to bed. Now they’ll have to reckon with new forensic evidence,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, told TechCrunch ahead of the report’s publication. “Ciro’s case adds to the big and politically tricky question: Who has been hacking Italian journalists with Paragon spyware? This mystery needs an answer.”.Scott-Railton said The Citizen Lab believes that the Italian government is in a position to definitively answer questions about what was done with their use of Paragon spyware, particularly regarding Ciro’s case.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-120000196.html

Hours earlier, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed Washington would unwind its recent tech curbs, if niche metals essential to US auto and defense firms now flowed fast enough..China’s focus was very different. A People’s Daily commentary on Thursday — Beijing’s most substantial comments so far on the talks — made no mention of export controls. Instead, the Communist Party mouthpiece touted an “institutional guarantee” established in Geneva for the two sides to bridge differences via a “consultation mechanism.” In a long-awaited leaders’ call before the London negotiations, Xi told Trump the importance of using this channel, it added..The contrast illustrates a disconnect in how the world’s biggest economies want to manage their trade dispute, and broader rollercoaster relationship. While Trump seeks quick deals done directly with top leaders, Xi favors a framework led by his lieutenants that wards against being blindsided. Such haggling could drag on for years, with the “Phase One” deal from the first trade war taking most of Trump’s first term..“Xi is playing a longer game on US-China trade. His time in office is simply much longer than Trump’s,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “That’s not to say there’s never any short-term thinking, but the lack of term limits presents very different incentives than for Trump.”.While slow-walking negotiations allows China the chance to assess how hard a bargain Trump drives with other nations, the lingering uncertainty is bad for business, he added..Xi showed last week he can be flexible, getting on the phone with Trump as ties spiraled, breaking from the protocol to set up such an interaction. In the Biden era, then National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Foreign Minister Wang Yi would huddle in foreign locations for days before their leaders spoke directly, managing outcomes and expectations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-plays-long-game-us-114305447.html
2025-06-12 17:45:00,Prediction: 3 Stocks Berkshire Hathaway Will Add to Its Portfolio After Warren Buffett Steps Down as CEO,"Berkshire could have multiple new holdings as Abel may want to put his stamp on the company.  There are some solid blue-chip stocks that aren't in Berkshire's portfolio that arguably should be in there already.  Next year, Berkshire Hathaway will have a new CEO.","By next year, Berkshire Hathaway will have a new CEO in Greg Abel..Berkshire could have multiple new holdings as Abel may want to put his stamp on the company..There are some solid blue-chip stocks that aren't in Berkshire's portfolio that arguably should be in there already..10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›.Next year, Berkshire Hathaway will have a new CEO. Warren Buffett, who has been in charge for decades, is stepping down and Greg Abel will be taking over. It's a monumental shift for the business, and while there may not necessarily be drastic changes in the day-to-day operations, there could be some adjustments to Berkshire's holdings..There are three stocks that I think Abel should consider adding to Berkshire's portfolio once he takes over: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's why these stocks are great long-term investments and why they fit the Berkshire mold..Buffett distanced himself from Microsoft because of his close association with co-founder Bill Gates. But with Buffett no longer at the helm, it opens the path for Berkshire to create a position in Microsoft under Abel..Microsoft is the type of business that checks all the boxes for Berkshire. It has solid fundamentals, many growth opportunities, and a strong brand that is known all over the world, giving it a fantastic competitive moat. .In the trailing 12 months, the software company generated more than $270 billion in revenue, amassing nearly $97 billion in profit along the way. Microsoft is a leading company in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, and its office software is a staple in many businesses around the world. This is an excellent stock for investors to own for the long haul, and I think it may just be a matter of time before it finds its way into Berkshire's holdings..With Abel being from Canada and having strong roots in Alberta, I think he'll be inclined to put his stamp on Berkshire. And what better way to do so than by opening up a position in a top oil and gas company from Canada -- Enbridge. Berkshire is no stranger to the sector and holds multiple stocks from there..Enbridge is known for its consistency and long-term dependability, which is why it also looks like a model Berkshire-type investment. This year, the company expects to meet or exceed its financial guidance, and if it does, it'll be the 20th consecutive year that Enbridge has done so. Few companies can generate that kind of consistency. And Buffett has always valued predictability and stability in businesses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-stocks-berkshire-hathaway-094500738.html

He invited individuals into the lab and asked them to judge the length of a line. He also placed 6 actors in the same room who were assigned to give the wrong answers so that the ignorant subject could hear them before he provided his own answer..On average, 35% of the subjects followed the opinions of the actors even if their answer was obviously wrong. That is horrifying. What is even worse is that the study has been replicated numerous times..Now, imagine a scenario in which the actors are given money immediately after giving the wrong answer, and the subject can see that too. What would be the percentage of subjects that gave the wrong answer then?.Related: Google resolves major privacy issue.That study hasn't been done, but I think we are witnessing something similar unfolding in the tech space..Marketing is everything..If artificial intelligence were called ""pattern matching and transformation,"" it would not sound so cool, would it?.Alas, there is precisely zero intelligence in AI. It is just pattern matching and transformation. This is why it hallucinates so much. The farther away from its training data the query you give to the AI is, the crazier the reply you'll get..Public companies don't do marketing just for consumers; they also need to attract investors. And when everyone around you starts hyping AI to attract investors, you may find yourself in a dilemma - is it OK to promise something you probably can't deliver?.Apple  (AAPL)  seems stuck in this dilemma but also faces significant pressures outside AI..President Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S. put Apple under pressure. The company expects tariffs to add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter..I've already written why large language models can't become sentient. But Apple can't afford to say that. They carefully dance around it by occasionally releasing a research paper on AI's limitations, but that usually looks like a jab at the competition..The company's management probably feels like a person in Asch's experiment, except that the actors are the competitors. Rivals promise stuff from science fiction, but that is still attracting investors..Chaos created by unrealistic marketing is real..Microsoft recently invested in an AI company that went bankrupt. The company had no AI but a huge number of humans doing the work.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-wwdc-underwhelms-fans-crucial-040908064.html

The Santa Clara, California chipmaker is putting in $25 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced plans..The financing is part of the company’s Series B funding round, which will value the company at around $4.5 billion and is led by a $100 million investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T, SFTBY).Internally, Samsung views its Skild investment as a way to keep visibility into the startup and its talent without needing to make a significant commitment. Another reason: to keep pace with other South Korean conglomerates like LG, Hanwha and Mirae Asset, which all have divisions putting between $5 million to $10 million into Skild..Nvidia has begun to push the idea of “physical AI” — meaning robots and autonomous vehicles — becoming a significant future revenue driver as the technology matures. The chipmaker has semiconductors, software and services aimed at speeding up the deployment of robots that can think for themselves..Samsung considers some aspects of Skild’s solutions inferior to others in the market, said some of the people. Representatives for Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment. A representative for Skild didn’t respond to an inquiry..Robotics are quickly becoming a major area of future growth for the world’s technology companies, with Apple Inc (AAPL)., Meta Platforms Inc.

Nevertheless, the firm said it’s sticking with the stock following its Worldwide Developers Conference reveal..“AAPL traded down ~1% following the WWDC25 keynote (note: AAPL declined 2% last year after WWDC24), where the company announced design improvements and new features across its operating systems and first-party apps, but failed to demonstrate substantial progress in Apple Intelligence.”.The company has also confirmed that any enhancements to make Siri more personal are postponed till next year. This is very unlike last year’s conference, where Siri was a highlight and mentioned numerous times..Despite these disappointments, analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that Apple is still a leader in consumer devices, with new features aimed at improving the user experience.

The company’s weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors. Nevertheless, Apple is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, is helping Apple sale more of its devices including iPhone. (You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Walt Disney’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry over the past year (+18.9% vs. +16.2%). The company reported steady second-quarter fiscal 2025 results wherein revenues and earnings increased year-over-year. Domestic Parks & Experiences grew due to domestic parks, Disney Vacation Club and Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by declines at international locations including Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.In Entertainment, DIS expects double-digit-percentage segment operating income growth in fiscal 2025. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2025 net sales to increase 3.7% from fiscal 2024. However, Disney+’s profitability is expected to be hurt by higher investments in content, which will also increase programming and production costs in the Entertainment segment. For fiscal Q3, Disney expects a modest increase in its Disney+ subscriber base on a sequential basis. Its leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here >>>)Shares of AMD have gained +1.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s gain of +17.5%. The company is benefiting from robust Data Center and Client revenues that fully offset sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Data centers are benefiting from solid adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises.New product launches, such as the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D and Radeon 9070 series, have been a major growth driver. Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD’s expanding partner base, including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AMD is also expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. However, AMD has been suffering from stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA. Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)Armanino Foods of Distinction’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (+53.1% vs. -4.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $252.15 million, presents a compelling investment case, driven by robust margin expansion, capital discipline and operational scalability. First-quarter 2025 net income surged 70% year over year, fueled by pricing strength, cost optimization and SG&A leverage. A structurally leaner model supports long-term profit growth. AMNF expanded its buyback to $12 million, repurchasing $4 million in shares and boosting EPS by 72%, underscoring prudent capital allocation. With zero debt and $23.8 million in cash, it retains strategic flexibility. Ongoing infrastructure upgrades and a $1.5-million capex plan enhance scalability.

This microcap company with a market cap of $71.27 million offers long-term revenue visibility supported by a $46 million-plus order backlog, including notable awards from BAE Systems and for XM157 laser filter units. Strong alignment with defense programs like the Bradley Fighting Vehicle drives demand across periscopes and laser optics. For H1 FY25, revenue grew 22.2% YoY to $18.9 million, led by a surge in periscope and laser filter sales. Gross margin rose to 29% on operating efficiencies. Cash improved to $3.5 million, enabling debt-free operations and reinvestment. The Applied Optics Center, contributing 49% of revenues, remains a high-margin engine. Optex also ramped up production by 50% to meet backlog execution needs. However, risks include 52% revenue concentration among government clients, a 12.3% drop in new orders, persistent supply chain pressures, and contract loss reserves tied to legacy fixed-price deals. (You can read the full research report on Optex Systems here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include KLA Corp.

These include significant updates like Call Screening, more travel-friendly features in Wallet, and highly requested group chat features in Messages..Some of these updates include Apple Intelligence, like Live Translation. Others, like Apple bringing back tabs in the Photos app, just make devices a bit easier to use. We’ll update this post as new features come out..Call Screening lets you determine what a call is about before picking it up. When you get a call from an unknown number, Call Screening will automatically answer silently in the background. When the caller shares their name and the reason for their call, the iPhone will ring, and you can view their response before deciding whether to pick up or ignore it..Hold Assist will detect hold music and stay on the line for you until a live agent is available, and Live Translation will translate conversations on the fly. Your words will be translated as you talk, and the translation is spoken out loud via an AI voice for the call recipient. As the person you’re speaking to responds in their own language, you’ll hear a spoken translation of their voice..Members in group chats on Messages can now create polls to better plan events and make quick decisions. Apple Intelligence will also detect when a poll might be useful and suggest that users start one. Plus, group chats can now create custom backgrounds for chats and see typing indicators, and you can now request, send, and receive Apple Cash in group chats..The app now also lets you screen messages from unknown senders. Messages from unknown senders will appear in a dedicated folder where you can mark the number as known, ask for more information, or delete the message. Apple notes that these messages will remain silenced until a user accepts them..Live Translation is also coming to Messages. The feature will automatically translate text for you as you type and deliver it in your preferred language. When the person you’re texting responds, their message will be translated for you..Apple Music users will get access to a Lyrics Translation feature to help them understand the words in their favorite songs in other languages. A new Lyrics Pronunciation feature will display phonetic lyrics so that listeners can sing along in a different language..The app is also adding an AudioMix feature that will transition from one song to the next using time stretching and beat matching like a DJ to deliver continuous playback. The feature could be seen as a competitor to Spotify’s AI DJ feature.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/features-coming-apple-ios-apps-193900718.html

2025-06-14 23:57:00,‘Classic Apple': Why Apple is taking the slow road with AI,"Apple is slow-rolling its AI rollout. Whether by design or necessity, it perfectly fits the company's MO.","Apple (AAPL) hosted its annual WWDC event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters on Monday, showing off a variety of improvements across its software offerings, including completely overhauled versions of the operating systems that power its devices..It was a jam-packed show, but one thing Apple didn't provide was a big, splashy AI announcement like its Big Tech peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) showed at their respective developer conferences last month..Wall Street is keen on seeing Apple prove it has what it takes to compete in the AI race, and a showstopping debut, like its highly anticipated generative AI-powered Siri, could have done just that. Instead, Apple said it is opening up its AI software to its army of developers and served up a number of smaller AI features that augment existing apps and platforms with new, helpful capabilities..And though that might not be the huge blowout news some investors were hoping for, the company's slower, more focused approach to AI could prove to be its best weapon in the AI fight..""Apple's AI strategy, as showcased, leans more towards systemic integration and developer empowerment rather than delivering groundbreaking consumer-facing AI functionalities that have captured market attention,"" IDC vice president Francisco Jeronimo wrote in a statement..""While this carries the risk of competitors moving faster, it also delineates a potential pathway for Apple to offer differentiated value, likely centered on its traditional pillars of privacy and seamless integration. This is a classic Apple modus operandi,"" Jeronimo added..Perhaps the most important AI announcement at WWDC was the news that Apple is opening up its on-device language models to third-party developers. While this might not sound all that interesting in and of itself, the move could pay significant dividends in the future..Apple's decision to give its roughly 30 million developers access to its language models is ""somewhat akin to a modernized App Store moment,"" Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring said..When Apple launched its App Store in 2008, it kicked off a massive explosion in app development that upended everything from delivery and transportation services to e-commerce and social media. It also gave Apple a fresh revenue stream via commissions on in-app purchases..Opening its AI models to developers could likewise help spur developers to create new software options that go well beyond what Apple could produce on its own, driving the development of apps and services that could eventually become household names.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/classic-apple-why-apple-is-taking-the-slow-road-with-ai-190306633.html

They’ll then be human-reviewed before being applied to apps on the App Store..Apple customers will be able to use these tags when searching for apps on the App Store, where the tags appear alongside the categories on the search page and the apps that appear in the search results..Apple says the new tags will help surface information that’s often buried in app listings, like the app’s App Store description, category, metadata, or even in its screenshots. The tags, Apple believes, will help users more easily find the apps that offer the functionality they’re looking for, while also giving developers a better idea about how their apps are being discovered..Today, consumers find apps through a number of App Store features, including its editorial pieces on the Today tab, collections curated by the App Store’s editorial team, by browsing app categories, or using App Store Search. Apple also monetizes the App Store with ads that can appear on the Today tab, the Search tab, on product pages, and in its search results..When App Store users tap on one of the new tags, they’ll be taken to a new page offering a curated collection of all the apps and games that offer similar features or functionality — an extension to the App Store’s existing feature that points users to apps they “might also like,” found at the bottom of individual listings..Although the tags themselves are AI-generated and reviewed, developers will ultimately have the final word on which tags are associated with their apps. A new information page will be available in the App Store Connect software, where they can manage tags or deselect those they don’t want to show up on their app’s product page..Apple is already using AI on its App Store to summarize an app’s reviews by combining information into a short paragraph..Tags aren’t the only improvements coming to the App Store. Apple says that developers will also be able to create custom product pages that appear when a user searches for apps using particular keywords. It’s also improving its app “nutrition labels” feature; expanding its lineup of app age ranges (there are now five); and extending offer codes to consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wwdc-apple-says-ai-tag-181733246.html

The translucent material reflects and refracts its surroundings and intelligently adapts between light and dark environments. Liquid Glass makes apps and system experiences more expressive, offering users greater focus on content.At WWDC25, the company announced new Apple Intelligence features like Live Translation, updates to visual intelligence, as well as enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji. Shortcuts can access Apple Intelligence directly. Developers also get access to the on-device large language model, which is at the core of Apple Intelligence. The latest features are now available for testing and are expected to be generally available this fall with supported devices.   Apple is expanding Services with AutoMix and Lyrics Translation features in Apple Music. Sing will allow users to transform their iPhones into a handheld microphone for Apple TV, while preferred routes and visited places in Apple Map make navigation easier for users. Apple Intelligence is now getting added to Apple Wallet, and users can make purchases with Apple Pay. Powered by Apple Intelligence, Apple Wallet can now automatically identify, summarize and display order tracking details from emails sent from merchants or delivery carriers. Meanwhile, Apple Pay expands the ability to pay with rewards and installments to in-store purchases for added flexibility and choice.The latest features and the Liquid Glass software design bode well for Apple’s prospects, although Apple Intelligence features lacked the “wow” factor. Apple continues to play catch-up in the AI domain against the likes of Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. Apple shares have declined 19.1% year to date (YTD), underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s appreciation of 2.5%. While Microsoft shares have returned 11.8% YTD, Amazon and Alphabet dropped 0.9% and 5.6%, respectively.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .So, what should investors do with Apple stock post the WWDC25 announcements? Let’s find out..Apple stock has suffered from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important market for Apple as the iPhone maker’s manufacturing is primarily concentrated in the country. Higher tariffs negatively impact Apple’s China supply chain. The Trump administration’s decision to exempt electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs provided some relief to Apple.  Tariffs are currently expected to have a negative impact of roughly $900 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Apple expects gross margin between 45.5% and 46.5% for the current quarter. In the fiscal second quarter, Apple reported a gross margin of 47.1%.Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone in China amid increasing competition from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. Greater China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-sell-hold-apple-stock-163200671.html

Instead, the UK is doing the opposite through a secret order..“This case could set a dangerous precedent and embolden nations to try to break the encryption that protects people’s private communication.”.Apple is challenging the “technical capability notice” from the Home Office, issued in January, that ordered it to secretly install a backdoor into the encryption feature it introduced in 2022..The iPhone-maker was legally barred from confirming the existence of the order, which emerged in US media reports. Disclosing the existence of the demand is illegal under UK surveillance laws..However, in February, Apple said it would be withdrawing the feature in the UK and said it would “never build a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will”..Ms Cooper’s order has prompted criticism from the White House and senior Republicans..Donald Trump described the demand as “something that you hear about with China”. Tulsi Gabbard, the US national intelligence director, called it “egregious”..WhatsApp said it would be arguing that the case should be heard in public..Mr Cathcart said: “WhatsApp would challenge any law or government request that seeks to weaken the encryption of our services and will continue to stand up for people’s right to a private conversation online.”.In April, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a secret court that hears cases about intelligence matters, ruled against the Home Secretary’s push for the case to be heard in total secrecy. This would have meant that even the existence of the dispute could not be publicised..The Home Office argued that any coverage of the matter could be “damaging to national security”. However, after an intervention by media groups, including The Telegraph, privacy advocates and a group of US politicians, Lord Justice Singh, the president of the tribunal, and Mr Justice Johnson dismissed the effort to keep even the “bare details” of the case private..The court said it was possible that some of the future developments in the case could be made public.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whatsapp-fights-yvette-cooper-dangerous-134755062.html

Instead, the company’s big splash was something called Liquid Glass – a new design aesthetic that adds a glass-like shine effect throughout iOS. The crowd nodded, clapped politely, and moved on. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Social","Let’s be honest; Most people walked away from Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2025) earlier this week… unimpressed..There was no shiny new VR headset or jaw-dropping “AI moment” like last year’s Apple Intelligence reveal..Instead, the company’s big splash was something called Liquid Glass – a new design aesthetic that adds a glass-like shine effect throughout iOS. The crowd nodded, clapped politely, and moved on..InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips.Social media users called it “pretty but iterative,” noting its similarities to Frutiger Aero and Windows Aero, popularized by Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows Vista..Some even said the keynote “lacked vision.”.But here’s the twist: We think that Liquid Glass is the vision..Apple may have just unveiled the beginning of the end of the smartphone era – and almost no one noticed….On the surface, Liquid Glass looks like a UI facelift. Everything’s more fluid, layered, and translucent. Buttons now shimmer. Toolbars refract. Menus float and breathe. The whole OS feels like it took a yoga retreat and came back with better posture..But we’re confident this isn’t just about making iOS look “prettier.”.Liquid Glass seems to be the first mass-market interface built for a world beyond screens..With this update, Apple is likely laying the groundwork for its next big thing: AI Glasses..It’s prepping hundreds of millions of users for a future where computing is ambient and intelligent; worn, not held..The titan may be the maker of the most successful consumer product of all time – the iPhone – but that success is now a golden cage….Growth has slowed. Replacement cycles are stretching. Regulators are circling. Innovation is incremental at best. Even Apple’s executives know the iPhone isn’t going to carry the company for the next 20 years..So, what’s it to do? What it always has – build the next platform..And we may have just seen the first flickers of it..While WWDC left glasses unmentioned, insiders, leakers, and chip supply chain reports have been saying the quiet part out loud:.Apple is developing a new chip specifically for smart glasses.These glasses may ship as early as 2026.They will have cameras, microphones, speakers, and – importantly – AI-powered visual intelligence.They will not have full AR displays at first. Think ambient AI, not “Iron Man” HUD.In short, Apple Glass v1.0 may look more like a beefed-up Ray-Ban Meta (META) than a Vision Pro. But the implications are still massive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wwdc-yawn-dawn-why-apple-155345078.html

Well, as long as you watch it on a compatible iPhone..Apple calls this latest trailer a “haptic trailer.”.In the two-minute trailer, whenever an F1 car is in motion on the screen, your iPhone will vibrate with an intensity proportional to the on-screen action. So when a car’s tires are being changed in a pit stop, you’ll feel a small vibration in your hand—and when the car continues racing down the track, you’ll feel an even more intense vibration..These vibration feedbacks in the gadget world are known as “haptics”—a technology that simulates physical touch. Apple can make your phone vibrate like this—and at certain points in the trailer, thanks to the iPhone’s Taptic Engine, a piece of hardware inside the iPhone that is essentially a motor that can vibrate on command..Haptic feedback has been used for years in the iPhone. For example, when you press and hold an icon on the homescreen to rearrange its layout, you’ll feel haptic feedback produced by the Taptic Engine. You can feel haptic feedback in plenty of other places on the iPhone, such as when adjusting the volume or pressing a widget in Control Center..But Apple’s application of haptic feedback to a movie trailer is the first time that the technology has been used to promote a film. Given the vibrations and forces an F1 car undergoes while racing down the track, a trailer for F1: The Movie is a natural fit for such technology..To watch the F1: The Movie haptic trailer, you’ll need an iPhone running the latest version of iOS 18. You can find the haptic trailer in the TV app on your iPhone by doing the following:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/literally-feel-apple-trailer-f1-123900974.html
2025-06-11 17:47:00,3 Reasons to Buy This Beaten-Down Warren Buffett Stock,"Apple generates plenty of cash to reinvest in the business.  Warren Buffett is still bullish on the stock.  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has taken a beating this year, with its shares down by 19% as of this writing.","Apple generates plenty of cash to reinvest in the business..The company has a deep ecosystem of loyal customers..Warren Buffett is still bullish on the stock..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has taken a beating this year, with its shares down by 19% as of this writing. It might be tempting to attribute that performance to marketwide troubles, and that's partly true. However, even as the Nasdaq Composite has recovered from being in bear market territory some weeks ago -- and is now slightly in the green for the year -- Apple has trailed far behind..The most immediate problem for the tech leader is President Trump's trade agenda, but there are others, including the fact that it trails other giants in the exciting artificial intelligence (AI) market. Despite these issues, there are compelling reasons to buy the stock. Here are three..Apple is no longer the growth stock it once was, but it continues to generate steady revenue, profits, and cash flow. In the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025, Apple's revenue increased by 5% year over year to $95.4 billion, with earnings per share coming in at $1.65, up almost 8% compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the tech giant generated $98.5 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Though that represents a 5% year-over-year decline, you'd be hard-pressed to find a single company worldwide with more cash to spare than Apple. Here's how it compares in that department with some of its similarly sized peers..Investors will be familiar with the phrase ""cash is king."" One reason behind this sentiment is that having a boatload of cash allows companies the flexibility to invest in lucrative opportunities without having to sacrifice their obligations. One thing we know about Apple is that it has fostered a culture of innovation, and the cash it currently holds could be one of the keys to unlocking the next big thing for the tech leader..It is working on various AI-related initiatives, including features it will add to its future smartphones. Apple may not make a breakthrough in the AI market immediately, but the company has a habit of improving existing technologies with great success. Having a substantial amount of cash on hand will enable the company to steer its AI strategy in whichever direction it chooses..It will also help it mitigate tariff-related issues, perhaps by shifting production to some countries other than China -- Trump's favorite tariff target -- while also somewhat boosting its local manufacturing capacity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-beaten-down-094700760.html
2025-06-11 08:08:00,4 observations about Apple’s low-key WWDC 2025,Steve Jobs might have loved Liquid Glass; the battle to keep the iPad from turning into a Mac seems to be over; and other takeaways from a keynote that wasn’t so short on news after all.,"At Apple’s annual WWDC keynote, the highest-level subject is always the future of its software platforms. And the big news in that department usually stares us right in the face. In 2023, for example, it was the debut of Apple Vision Pro, the company’s entry into the headset market and its first all-new experience since the Apple Watch. Last year brought Apple Intelligence, its branded take on what AI should look like as a core element of computing experiences..Most Read from Fast Company.Starbucks just developed an ingenious way to add 15 grams of protein to almost any drink .RIP to the almost future of computing: Apple just turned the iPad into a Mac.5 ways to rewire your brain for happiness.And then there was Monday morning’s WWDC 2025 keynote, as streamed online to millions and screened to a select audience of in-person attendees at Apple Park. After Apple’s embarrassing inability to ship the AI-infused update to Siri it showed off at WWDC 2024, it was hardly surprising that this year’s event didn’t bet everything on whipping up a further AI frenzy. That alone set it apart from last month’s Google I/O keynote, whose topics consisted of AI, AI, and more AI, with some AI drizzled on top..Apple did introduce some new AI during the keynote—quite a bit of it. Overall, though, the event felt like an act of counterprogramming. Instead of positioning itself as a leader in AI—or at least quashing fears that it’s a laggard—the company seemed happy being itself. From the unified new design to old features (phone calls!) turning up in new places (the Mac!), it focused on giving consumers even more reasons to own and use as many of its products as possible..Herewith a few of the impressions I took away from my morning at Apple Park:.Liquid Glass is classic Apple, in the Steve Jobs sense. In 2012, one of Tim Cook’s first dramatic moves after succeeding Jobs as CEO was to oust software chief Scott Forstall. That led to a reorganization that put Jony Ive in charge of design for software as well as hardware. Ive’s influence was seen in the iPhone’s iOS 7 upgrade the company shipped the following year. It ditched the lush skeuomorphism of the iPhone’s software up until that time for a far flatter look, bringing to mind the understated, Dieter Rams-like feel of an Ive MacBook, manifested in pixels rather than aluminum. Ive left in 2019, but the principles he instilled have informed Apple software ever since..But now there’s Liquid Glass, a new aesthetic Apple is rolling out across its portfolio of platforms. It’s glossy, dimensional, pseudorealistic, and animated—a dramatic departure from iOS 7-era restraint, but reminiscent of both earlier iOS releases and also older Apple software all the way back to the first version of the Mac’s OS X in 2000. That was the one with buttons that Jobs said people would want to lick—a memorable design imperative that is suddenly relevant again.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-observations-apple-low-key-000848826.html

Apple Intelligence (yes, also abbreviated to AI) showed up in Apple's ecosystem in October 2024, and it's here to stay as Apple competes with Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others to build the best AI tools. What is Apple Intelligence? Image Credits:Apple Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “","If you've upgraded to a newer iPhone model recently, you've probably noticed that Apple Intelligence is showing up in some of your most-used apps, like Messages, Mail, and Notes. Apple Intelligence (yes, also abbreviated to AI) showed up in Apple's ecosystem in October 2024, and it's here to stay as Apple competes with Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others to build the best AI tools..Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music..The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts..Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence to generate custom emojis (Genmojis) in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is a standalone image generation app that utilizes prompts to create visual content that can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media..Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple’s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it’s doing its thing..More importantly, new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It’s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you’re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer..Leading up to WWDC 2025, many expected that Apple would introduce us to an even more souped-up version of Siri, but we're going to have to wait a bit longer..“As we’ve shared, we’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,"" said Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi at WWDC 2025. ""This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-intelligence-coming-164731847.html

That's in California. And joining us now from that conference is Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley. Dan. .Yeah, Josh, uh, this is, you know, day two, as you said, developers are still kind of milling around, analysts and journalists like myself are, are also here. And there's some takeaways that we're getting from the event yesterday now. And so one of those is kind of based on Apple's approach to AI and how that's been kind of a slow trickle from the huge explosion that we saw last year with Apple intelligence to what we saw this year where instead of a new big splashy announcement, they had smaller bits of AI that they're weaving throughout their operating system. It looks like that's going to be Apple's path forward, at least for now. And so we hear something about that new generative AI powered series that it's supposed to come at some point either this year or next year. We're still not entirely sure. That seems to be the way that Apple can compete and potentially win this AI race that they have against the likes of Google and Samsung. I think one of the things that gets conflated because of the idea that AI is so large is comparing Apple's approach to something like a Microsoft, which obviously provides the majority of its AI services to enterprises. And yes, they do have consumers, but if you look at, you know, the balance, it's going to be on the enterprise side. And so they obviously compete with Google as well as far as smartphones, .but really it comes down to the enterprise and what they can offer to advertising. So Apple's approach is going to be different naturally, but this way of kind of moving forward with the dribs and drabs, generally, it seems as though I, I got to see a few of these, these features that are truly helpful updates. So it's not that, you know, we're still seeing those, you know, make emojis or things like that, but then there's also ways of adding functionality to existing apps with AI that so far seems to be pretty, pretty helpful for users. .Dan, here, here's my big question for you as, as a reporter who has followed Apple for a long time. You know, Apple not interested in being first and as you know, they are interested in, in getting it right and then succeeding in that market. So, and listen, that has proved to be a very successful tactic and strategy for Apple. Can Apple do that again, Dan, in your opinion, when it comes to AI? .I think they can, right? I mean, look, as you said, they've done this again and again. They were not the first with music players. I think the Microsoft Zoom might have been before that, or maybe not the Zoom, but there were things like mini disc players that tried to, you know, make smaller music players, but then the iPod came out and it killed it. They weren't the first, uh, when it came to, uh, you know, smartphones, the idea of smartphones. Uh, there were ideas out there already, but they kind of just honed it and created the iPhone. And so same thing with, you know, wireless earbuds and smartwatches and fitness trackers, what have you. They've done this over and over and over again. And it, you know, it's their kind of MO where they let everyone trip over themselves getting out the, the, you know, the, the starting blocks, right? To be first. Uh, and then they kind of take their time and provide products that don't miss or more often than not, don't miss and give general, general utility to users. And I think that's what they're doing here, right? So, uh, some of the offerings that they have on include the ability to, uh, you know, create spreadsheets very quickly from recipes that you may have, and you need to scale that up, uh, for, for different aspects of, of what you maybe want to do is as far as parties go and things along those lines. So I think that those are really truly helpful rather than, you know, the whole idea of let's take pieces out of images. They also spent a lot of this event catching up, really. So they have, uh, Google has what's called circle of search. Samsung also offers it where you can circle something on your phone that you take a picture of or from your, your screen and then be able to search for it really quickly. Now Apple has that in their visual intelligence app, and that's a truly helpful feature. I use something like that on my own to, to search for something, a flower that I had seen, wanted to know if it was bad for my cats or not. .It turns out it was. Got it out of the house. This adds to that. So there, I think that that strategy could absolutely take off here. Wall Street obviously wants to see a big explosive, splashy announcement. They're not getting that yet. We'll see what happens when Siri comes out. And if Siri is even helpful as far as users go, are we going to want to use that on the daily, or is it just going to be something that we kind of, you know, use for a minute and then fall out of love with like the prior series? And then these smaller announcements become the more important ones. .We shall see. Still a lot of questions after this event. Dan, thank you. Appreciate it.
