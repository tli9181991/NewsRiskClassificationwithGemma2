Only select invited Tesla users were invited to test the robotaxi service in Austin..Scaling a robotaxi business that could take on industry leader Waymo (GOOG, GOOGL) would take thousands of vehicles operating without safety operators, as well as creating the infrastructure to clean and service the robotaxis..While some see the robotaxi launch as the start of a new era, others think the scale issue will be a big one..""We believe the much better question ahead is on the path of scaling, which we believe will be long, and we caution against overoptimism,"" Barclays' Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients Monday morning. Levy has an Equal weight rating (the equivalent of Hold) and a $275 price target..In addition to scale, there is a big concern over safety. Other players, like GM’s Cruise (GM) and Uber (UBER), had to cease operations following high-profile accidents, with an Uber test leading to a pedestrian death..Earlier on Monday Reuters reported that Tesla said answers to regulator NHTSA's questions regarding safety of its robotaxi operations was confidential business information, and should not be made public..Nonetheless, Wall Street bulls were cheering Tesla’s early success..“We took two approximately 15 minute rides around Austin and the key takeaways are that it was a comfortable, safe, and personalized experience,” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note published late Sunday. Ives has an Outperform rating on Tesla and a lofty $500 price target..In a particularly tense moment, Ives said, the robotaxi drove up a hill on a narrow road with cars parked on both sides, oncoming traffic, and people opening their car doors into the road, but the robotaxi “masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety among this chaos.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-pops-8-after-foundational-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-200136126.html

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman chat with Washington Crossing Advisors senior portfolio manager Chad Morganlander and Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz about the event and what it means for Tesla investors..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here..All right, now let's turn to my stock of the day. That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

The company said that this tool is still in the experimental stage and users will need to opt in to it through Search Labs..Once a user has opted in, they can ask queries in English. Google didn’t specify whether it plans to support local languages or when that might be available..Users can search for answers to complex, multi-part queries such as “My kids are 4 and 7 and have lots of energy. Suggest creative ways to get them active and moving indoors, especially on hot days, without needing a lot of space or expensive toys.” Additionally, users can ask follow-up questions to refine results..Google started testing AI mode with premium subscribers in the U.S. earlier this year. The company then started broadly rolling out the feature to all U.S. users after its Google IO event. Over time, the company has added a shopping feature, introduced voice and image search support, and also introduced ads..The company said that voice and image search features are supported for users in India, given that voice is a popular mode for search. It added that the AI mode is powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The company also noted that early testers of the AI mode are asking 2-3x longer queries..With more than 870 million internet users, India is one of the biggest markets for Google. It also acts as a testing ground for the company to observe how multilingual users use its products..While Google still has a lion’s share in the search market, people have started using chat-based AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity more in their daily lives. With AI mode, Google wants users who prefer that kind of interface to use its own product..Apart from AI mode, Google has been pushing products such as AI overviews, which summarize query results for you, in search. The company said in April that more than 1.5 billion people are using AI overviews across the globe. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google’s AI features are hurting publishers, which have seen traffic drop-offs from organic search.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-introduces-ai-mode-users-054004938.html

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday. He raised his price target to $215, well short of its close at $322.16 last week..Explainer: Why Tesla’s Valuation Rests on Musk More Than Reality.Videos of the robotaxi launch posted Sunday were mostly mundane, showing Model Y SUVs driving short distances, navigating intersections, avoiding pedestrians and parking — all with no one sitting in the driver’s seat. The debut was “largely uneventful” and free of major missteps, with the start of revenue service marking a “critical milestone” for bulls in the stock, Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a note.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-starts-long-awaited-robotaxi-003252048.html

2025-06-24 05:10:00,"Top Stock Picks for Week of June 23, 2025",Earnings Growth & Price Strength Make This Company a Stock to Watch and a Software Stock in a Bullish Trend.,"Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions. The company expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. Management execution has been good in recent times, which has helped Alphabet to build solid cash and short-term investment balance. Additionally, GOOGL's earnings are expected to grow 18.3% for the current fiscal year. .Intuit Inc. (INTU) is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals globally.Intuit’s recent performance has been benefiting from steady revenues from the Online Ecosystem and Desktop business segments. Strong momentum in Online Services revenues driven by strong performances of Mailchimp, payroll and Money, which includes payments, capital and bill pay. The Credit Karma business is benefiting from strength in Credit Karma Money, credit cards, auto insurance and personal loans. INTU’s strategy of shifting its business to a cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. After reaching an important support level, Intuit should be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. INTU surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. Shares of INTU have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 5.7%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, suggesting that INTU could be poised for a continued surge. The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account INTU's positive earnings estimate revisions..Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In April 2025, xAI launched Grok Studio, a split-screen workspace that lets users collaborate with Grok on generating documents, code, reports, and browser games. It also launched the ability to create Workspaces that let you organize files and conversations in a single place..While OpenAI and Microsoft have similar tools, Google’s Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building. Google’s tools can edit Docs and Sheets and allow you to chat with Gemini while looking at or editing documents. The difference is that Gemini Workspace only works within Google’s ecosystem..It’s not clear what types of files xAI’s editor might support aside from spreadsheets, or whether xAI plans to build a full productivity suite that could compete with Google Workspace or Microsoft 365..If Owji’s findings are true, the advanced editor would be a step toward Elon Musk’s ambitions to turn X into an “everything app” that includes docs, chat, payments, and social media.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leak-reveals-grok-might-soon-181657484.html
2025-06-24 00:25:00,Tesla finally began a limited version of long-promised robotaxi service. But there were some bumps,Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi service began in Austin Texas for a select group of the company’s fans.,"Tesla’s much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company’s fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat..It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step..Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet..But the start of the Tesla service Sunday was only a fraction of any of that. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March..But the Austin test pressed on regardless..The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives’ team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday..Ives’ note to clients, which cited how a Tesla “safety monitor” sat in the front passenger seat while no person was in the driver’s seat, praised the quality of the rides taken by his team member..“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.”.But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. In one YouTube video, the robotaxi drove on the wrong side of the road after it attempted and abandoned a left turn, only to continue traveling down the street on the opposite side of a double yellow line before making the left turn on the following block. Fortunately, there were no vehicles driving on the other side of the road.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-finally-began-limited-version-162518514.html
2025-06-23 22:45:00,Baidu vs. Alphabet: Which AI Powerhouse Stock Deserves Your Cash?,Can BIDU compete with GOOGL's AI edge and financial muscle despite its setbacks?,"Baidu BIDU and Alphabet GOOGL share roots in Internet search and have evolved into global AI heavyweights, each riding the wave of generative AI and cloud services. Baidu, China’s dominant search engine, has leveraged its platform to develop and deploy advanced AI models—like ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1—as well as autonomous driving technology through its Apollo initiative. Alphabet, Google’s parent, spans search, advertising, Cloud, YouTube, and hardware, and is spearheading AI progress with Gemini 2.5, AI-powered Cloud services, and TPUs such as Ironwood.The recent surge of interest in generative AI and language models has put companies like Baidu and Alphabet in the spotlight. Google’s rollout of AI features (like its Bard/Gemini AI for search) and Baidu’s launch of its ERNIE Bot (an answer to ChatGPT) underscore how both are racing to monetize AI innovations. Investors are wondering which company is better positioned today for upside. Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu is the unrivaled search leader in China, controlling roughly 60% of China’s search engine market. This core search dominance provides a massive user base and ad platform akin to Google’s in its home market. Beyond search advertising, Baidu has aggressively invested in next-generation tech: its Apollo autonomous driving unit and Apollo Go ride-hailing service are growing (Apollo Go saw a 75% year-over-year increase in rides in first-quarter 2025), and Baidu’s AI Cloud division is booming with 42% revenue growth in the last reported quarter. AI Cloud's non-GAAP operating margin now sits at the level of teens, aided by improved revenue mix and scale efficiencies. The company’s focus on full-stack AI infrastructure and rapid model iteration—most notably the release of ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo—has significantly reduced inference costs while enhancing performance. These improvements make Baidu’s AI Cloud offerings highly cost-competitive, especially as enterprise clients increasingly look to deploy Gen AI applications at scale.Baidu faces several key challenges as it pivots aggressively toward AI. Its online marketing revenue declined 6% year over year, reflecting weakness in its traditional ad business amid a transition to AI-powered search that is not yet fully monetized. While AI-generated content now powers 35% of mobile search results, monetization remains in early testing, putting pressure on near-term revenue and margins. Additionally, Baidu reported negative free cash flow of RMB9.2 billion (excluding iQIYI), driven by rising investments in AI infrastructure, cloud services, and autonomous driving. The company also faces intensifying competition from rivals like Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY in the AI cloud space, while U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips could disrupt its infrastructure scale-up. Although Baidu touts flexibility in chip sourcing and strong GPU utilization, these constraints could still impact efficiency. Moreover, the wide scope of its AI initiatives, from foundation models to digital humans and robotaxis, raises execution risks and may strain resources in the near term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-alphabet-ai-powerhouse-134500273.html

The tool also lets you select text and quickly add an event to the calendar..Last year, Google added a new “quick insert” key to some Chromebook Plus models that lets you trigger shortcuts. Users can now access Google’s AI image-generation features with this key, as well as AI-powered writing tools..Meanwhile, the new “Simplify” feature lets you use AI to explain, simplify, or summarize any text you have selected..Google’s also giving all new Chromebook Plus users one year’s subscription to the Google AI Pro plan, which includes access to the Gemini app; video editing tool Flow; image-to-video creation tool Whisk; Gemini in Gmail, Docs, and Chrome; and 2TB of storage.

I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence..On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights....1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300."".CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power..This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines..And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth..If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.).For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare..Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each..And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI..I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed..Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-085200107.html

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Is Google at risk of losing its online discovery crown to ChatGPT?.Well, not yet..As you can see in this overview of online search traffic, put together by the team at Visual Capitalist, OpenAI’s chatbot still lags Google by a significant margin, and with Google also incorporating its own AI answers, it may still be able to fend off rising competition from ChatGPT, and maintain its place as king of the heap..Based on data presented which was presented by NP Digital at Web Summit 2025, Google still leads the way in overall web search activity, facilitating some 13.7 billion searches per day. Instagram comes in second (6.5 billion searches per day), though interestingly, Snapchat and LinkedIn also rank high for daily search activity, higher than Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing and Pinterest..I would have assumed that all of these would see more search activity than Snap, but NP Digital says that the data has been sourced from multiple sources. Which could also point to variances in tracking process..Either way, the topline note is that ChatGPT still has a long way to go to become the key search engine, though it is growing fast, and as more and more people converse with AI chatbots, it's quickly becoming a more habitual search process..Recommended Reading .Google Highlights Top Halloween Search Trends",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-catching-google-search-activity-205430327.html

Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI.  Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead.","Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure..Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI..Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world we live in, making it a must-invest sector..Let's look at 10 AI stocks to invest in right now..The king of AI, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their fast processing speeds. However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083000803.html
2025-06-22 06:05:00,Is OpenAI's Deal With Alphabet a Game Changer?,OpenAI just teamed up with Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform.,"For the last couple of years, OpenAI has relied heavily on Microsoft to supply compute power through the Azure cloud platform..Recently, OpenAI has been exploring new cloud partnerships with Oracle and now Google in an effort to migrate away from Microsoft..Teaming up with OpenAI could be a transformative move for Alphabet as its core search business continues to face pressure..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.For more than two years now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company has raised billions in funding from Microsoft, works closely with leading AI-focused cloud providers such as CoreWeave, and is among the key players pushing a $500 billion domestic AI infrastructure initiative called Project Stargate..Recently, OpenAI found itself in the headlines yet again following news of a major partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)..Let's explore how OpenAI and Alphabet are teaming up, and assess why this deal could be a game changer..Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital. As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure..While Azure's infrastructure has been key to OpenAI maintaining explosive growth over the last two years, recent moves from the ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft..For instance, as part of Project Stargate, Oracle is reportedly exploring purchasing several billion dollars worth of Nvidia's newest Blackwell GPU architecture and leasing access to these chips to OpenAI..According to recent reporting, OpenAI's partnership with Alphabet revolves around the same use case as the Oracle deal: accessing compute power through the Google Cloud Platform. As data workloads continue to rise, training and inferencing AI models becomes increasingly sophisticated and costly. Hence, broadening its cloud compute infrastructure beyond Azure is critical for OpenAI..While cloud computing has emerged as a fast-growing business for Alphabet, Google Cloud operates at a much smaller scale than Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). That said, working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business and AI efforts..However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-deal-alphabet-game-changer-220500302.html

Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same.","Robotaxis aren't an optional extra for the car industry; they are the future of mobility..One company stands best placed to deliver affordable electric vehicles..The two companies could potentially become partners..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.-The comparison between Ford (NYSE: F) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is valuable and valid because it speaks to where the auto industry is headed and highlights the relative position of each company as it moves toward electric vehicles and robotaxis. Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same. So, which company is better placed to thrive in the future?.Tesla's launch of its full-self-driving (FSD) robotaxi is sometimes seen as a tactical move as its electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share come under pressure in 2025, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that major automakers, including Ford, and leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving, and it's an integral part of the future of the auto industry..The reason behind the investment is a recognition that robotaxis have huge profit potential, not least because they offer a long stream of recurring income from ride-per-mile revenue..Another reality is that EVs are not cheap, and if they are the future of the auto industry, automakers need to make them more affordable. They also need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable..However, don't take my word for it. Here's Ford's CEO Jim Farley in 2019 on autonomous driving and robotaxis: ""The self-driving system is incredibly important to develop, but it's just one part of building a safe and scalable self-driving service that consumers can trust."" Farley went on to outline a timeline for a ""commercial self-driving service"" in 2021, which Ford would fail to achieve..As for affordable EVs, last year, Farley reiterated the need to offer smaller and more affordable EVs to achieve profitability as an EV maker..The two things are strongly connected. You can't have robotaxi EVs if the vehicles aren't affordable. That's a point that resonated during a recent CNBC interview with Waymo, which has a robotaxi service already in place, yet co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana declined to outline a timeline for the company's profitability. Waymo's lack of profitability means its owner, Alphabet, is going to have to invest significant sums, at a loss, if it wants Waymo to build scale. That creates a huge opportunity for a company like Tesla that is just entering the market and potentially offers a much more commercial and scalable service.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-200500011.html

He shares his key takeaways from his experiences and why, ultimately, Tesla (TSLA) may have a leg up on the rival..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Waymo, we know, right now Stephen, far ahead. What are Tesla's competitive advantages in this space? When you explain them to clients, or what do you tell them? .Yeah, it's interesting. I've been in, I've been in Waymos and full self-driving Teslas and and, you know, the first thing that that jumped out to me was that the Tesla system felt more, more natural, right, in the process. Now, the, when you look at the Waymo system, and, you know, this is on the vehicles you see in San Francisco and other cities. Uh, or sounds like they're coming to New York at some point in the not too distant future. They have multiple redundancies in the system, right? They have cameras, they have LiDAR, they have radar and they, they because of those redundancies you know if people look at them and say there there's a higher level of safety. When you look at the, the Tesla system, you know, it's camera based and it's AI based, and they have massive quantities of data uh to do the analysis. Uh, to me the vehicles kind of felt a little more natural, but look but what we tell people is you know the lack of redundancies, the camera-based system only. There are some risks to that. Now, on the positive side, there's really three big benefits. Right, one is cost, right, if you're, if you're talking about a, a robotaxi which you're showing on the screen right now or whether we should talk about a Model Y that I that I subscribed to FSD with, you know the car can be $30 or $40,000. A a Waymo fully equipped with all the sensors, etc. is well north of a hundred thousand dollars. So cost is one. Second is uh, I think clearly the massive fleet of Teslas that are out there right now, which can become part of of a robotaxi fleet over time. But if I have a Tesla Model Y in the driveway and I have a you know full self-driving, you know theoretically I can drive that car to work and dump it into the robotaxi fleet. So the ability to scale based on a massive installed base uh is probably the second uh big positive. And, and then the third is their ability, I think, to have some flexibility whether it's uh, you know, some Tesla owned assets, assets owned by by individuals and even, even you know partnering with at some point or even using a you know me having a Tesla and dumping it into an Uber or or a Lyft fleet if I if I so choose. So there's multiple avenues for the company over time. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-vs-waymo-difference-between-120003596.html

Remember, the movie by the same name doesn't have the happiest of endings, and the tragedy made sense as a metaphor for potential market bubbles. Still, the Magnificent Seven group keeps setting the tone for the overall stock market, and most of these stocks are market darlings in 2025, with double-digit price gains over the last 52 weeks..But Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is lagging behind with a 2% price dip over the last year, and the stock looks downright undervalued in many ways. It's the only Magnificent Seven stock I have bought this year, for one simple reason: It's the best combination of affordable shares and unbeatable artificial intelligence (AI) expertise in this elite group..The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running circles around Google Cloud..But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices.

Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chips fall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-prediction-someone-invested-110000215.html

More people are looking for e-mail, messaging and even search providers outside the United States..The first months of Trump's second presidency have shaken some Europeans' confidence in their long-time ally, after he signalled his country would step back from its role in Europe's security and then launched a trade war..""It's about the concentration of power in U.S. firms,"" said Topio's founder Michael Wirths, as his colleague installed on a customer's phone a version of the Android operating system without hooks into the Google ecosystem..Wirths said the type of people coming to the stall had changed: ""Before, it was people who knew a lot about data privacy. Now it's people who are politically aware and feel exposed."".Tesla chief Elon Musk, who also owns social media company X, was a leading adviser to the U.S. president before the two fell out, while the bosses of Amazon, Meta and Google-owner Alphabet took prominent spots at Trump's inauguration in January..Days before Trump took office, outgoing president Joe Biden had warned of an oligarchic ""tech industrial complex"" threatening democracy..Berlin-based search engine Ecosia says it has benefited from some customers' desire to avoid U.S. counterparts like Microsoft's Bing or Google, which dominates web searches and is also the world's biggest email provider..""The worse it gets, the better it is for us,"" founder Christian Kroll said of Ecosia, whose sales pitch is that it spends its profits on environmental projects..Similarweb data shows the number of queries directed to Ecosia from the European Union has risen 27% year-on-year and the company says it has 1% of the German search engine market..But its 122 million visits from the 27 EU countries in February were dwarfed by 10.3 billion visits to Google, whose parent Alphabet made revenues of about $100 billion from Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2024 - nearly a third of its $350 billion global turnover.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europeans-seek-digital-sovereignty-us-090309961.html

Do this instead,"Here are some other, safer ways to verify your identity and sign into your accounts.","Do you receive login security codes for your online accounts via text message? These are the six- or seven-digit numbers sent via SMS that you need to enter along with your password when trying to access your bank accounts, health records, online photos, and more. This type of security is known as multifactor authentication (MFA) and is designed to keep your account secure even if someone knows your password. Without the additional security code, bad actors can’t gain access to your data. Or at least that’s the idea..Most Read from Fast Company.Kroger is closing 60 stores: See the list of locations that are reportedly shuttering in 2025 so far.Housing market map: Zillow just released its updated home price forecast for 400-plus housing markets.What’s behind the rise in interim CEOs.It’s increasingly becoming evident that security codes sent by text message may leave our data less secure than we thought. Fortunately, there are other, more secure ways to keep your accounts safe. Here’s why it’s probably a good idea to stop using SMS for your security codes, and what you can use instead..You may think that the text message you receive with the code you need to log into your account is coming from Amazon, Google, Meta, or whoever provides the service you are logging into. But it’s probably not—and therein lies the security risk..Bloomberg and Lighthouse Reports just released an alarming report revealing that some of the most prominent tech companies recommending that users enable multifactor authentication—including Amazon, Google, and Meta—have used third-party companies to send their security codes to users via text..Some of these third-party companies have been linked to institutions in the surveillance industry and even government spy agencies. Additionally, some of the security codes that these third-party companies were responsible for transmitting have been associated with data breaches of individuals’ accounts. Worse: the intermediaries operating in this space do so with little oversight from their tech giant clients or regulators..And Bloomberg and Lighthouse Reports’ piece isn’t the first to warn about the vulnerability that texted security codes expose users to. In December, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning to the public, urging people to migrate away from receiving security codes via text. “Do not use SMS as a second factor for authentication,” the CISA’s memo warned. “SMS messages are not encrypted—a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-security-codes-ask-receive-090000541.html
2025-06-21 16:35:00,Is Apple Stock In Trouble?,The company is struggling to innovate with cutting-edge technologies.,"Apple has failed with its first foray into virtual reality..The company is falling behind in artificial intelligence..Apple stock trades at an expensive P/E ratio..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has entered a rough patch. The smartphone and computer giant is down around 10% in the last 12 months, while artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are soaring..Management has made some major missteps in virtual reality and false promises with its Siri and Apple Intelligence services. Revenue is growing slowly, and innovation seems to be lacking for this storied technology brand..Is Apple in trouble? Here's why investors should be concerned about owning shares of this stock..Back in early 2024, Apple released the Vision Pro, an expensive virtual reality headset that it promised was the next evolution in computing. The device sold for $3,500 and had a futuristic ski-goggle look and aimed to replace the personal computer for people working at home. Apple has been researching virtual and augmented reality technologies for years, but this was its first large foray into the cutting-edge computing space..Now in June 2025, the Apple Vision Pro looks like a total flop. The company had to scale back production because of weak demand, failed to attract developers to make applications for the device, and has sold fewer than 1 million devices (reportedly) since its launch. Even if it sold 1 million of these devices a year, that equates to $3.5 billion in annual revenue, compared to $400 billion in consolidated revenue for Apple. The device isn't going to move the needle financially..The Vision Pro can officially be called a flop. New versions may change consumer sentiment, but Apple has failed in its first foray into the virtual reality space. This company is still being driven by the iPhone and iPhone software and services..Speaking of smartphones, Apple has promised customers and investors that new AI-focused updates will be coming to Apple devices shortly. Bullish investors see this as a reason for customers to upgrade their iPhones, which has been a nagging issue for the company, as customers are sticking with older devices for longer..As with the Vision Pro, Apple talked a big game around upgrades for Siri and Apple Intelligence products. However, the actual products released have been lackluster..At its annual developer conference, the company delayed the launch of AI Siri to early next year. At the same time, AI competitors, such as Alphabet and OpenAI, are pushing forward with cutting-edge productivity tools, leaving Apple in the dust.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-trouble-083500043.html

And there's good reason for that. His Baupost Group hedge fund returned an average of 20% per year over the first 30 years of its existence. That performance comes despite value stocks falling well out of favor over the last decade..But Klarman and his team emphasize that they ""remain flexible in their application"" of value investing. That means investing in stocks that are mispriced relative to their value, even if they won't show up on any stock screeners for deep value based on traditional metrics. As a result, this method can end up with some stocks that many investors would consider growth stocks, such as those found in the Magnificent Seven..But Klarman only sees one member of the vaunted group of trillion-dollar stocks as worth his and his investors' money, and he just added more of it to Baupost's portfolio..The Magnificent Seven is a group of stocks full of interesting opportunities for the right investor. And anyone who invested in any or all of them is probably happy with their returns over the last couple of years. But a few may not present the value necessary for an investment from someone like Klarman. As a group, they're relatively expensive based on traditional valuation standards..Four of the seven sport forward P/E ratios above 30, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) with its 168 times multiple. While Tesla could prove worth the price with its plans for a robotaxi service and humanoid robots, there's a lot of risk in buying the stock at its current price, especially as its core car business is facing stiff competition abroad. The other high-priced members are growing quickly and on relatively solid footing, but it's hard to argue they're a bargain at their current prices..But one member of the group trades for a valuation below the S&P 500's average, and that's kind of surprising for a stock with such strong growth potential. The stock has consistently traded at or near the lowest valuation of the Magnificent Seven, giving investors plenty of opportunities. That's why Klarman and his team have built up a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), including adding 652,000 more shares in the first quarter, increasing its stake in the company by 46%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-seth-klarman-holds-just-075500478.html

Perplexity recently closed a new round of funding at a $14 billion valuation..Meta also attempted to hire Perplexity Chief Executive Officer Aravind Srinivas to join the social media company’s new “superintelligence” team, which is focused on building more powerful AI systems, the people said..The talks with Meta, which have not previously been reported, highlight Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s willingness to use deals and big hires to catch up in the AI race. The talks took place before Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that gives it a 49% stake in the data-labeling startup..Meta and Perplexity didn’t respond to requests for comment..Founded in 2022, Perplexity has emerged as one of the most prominent startups using generative AI to rethink core internet services. Perplexity is taking on Alphabet Inc.’s Google by offering an AI tool that summarizes search results, lists citations for its answers and helps users refine their queries to get the best responses.

Shares of Uber Technologies UBER declined on the news due to concerns of future competition in one of the largest ride-hailing markets in the United States..Waymo has applied for the permit to begin testing its self-driving vehicles in Manhattan. The proposed tests would include a trained human specialist in the vehicle to supervise operations. Regardless of whether the permit is granted, Waymo intends to begin collecting data and evaluating its autonomous driving technology in the city from next month..Alphabet’s Waymo already offers fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services in several major U.S. cities, having achieved significant milestones in the industry. However, Waymo faces substantial regulatory barriers in New York, with current state laws not permitting fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing services..We do not expect Waymo’s move to apply for a testing permit in the densely populated New York City to have much of an adverse impact on Uber’s prospects as feared. Ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft LYFT have successfully navigated complex regulatory relationships with the city. Shares of Lyft also fell on the move by Alphabet’s autonomous driving platform, on concerns about future competition for ride-hailing companies..Uber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. The ride-hailing giant has a partnership with Waymo, too, in this regard. By adopting this approach, Uber has avoided the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. In 2020, Uber sold its self-driving division but retained focus on becoming the ultimate ride-hailing super app..Uber’s dominant market share in the ride-hailing industry also gives it a unique advantage in the lucrative robotaxi market. With its vast network of drivers and customers, Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures. Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners, giving users a variety of options..Lyft is also aiming to be a key player in the lucrative and emerging autonomous vehicle market, highlighting the immense competition in the space. The global robotaxi market is projected to reach $45.7 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 91.8% from 2025 to 2034..Shares of UBER have gained 34.9% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s 9.5% decline in the same timeframe.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-applies-nyc-testing-permit-142800976.html

The findings also potentially allow other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s lead as countries around the world grapple with ways to protect children from harmful content online..“Age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective,” the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial said in a statement Friday announcing its preliminary findings..The trial’s project director, Tony Allen, said there were “no significant technological barriers” to stopping under-16s gaining social media accounts. “These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said..Under the new law, digital platforms including Snapchat, Meta-owned Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches..The trial tested a range of methods and technologies, including facial scans, inferring a user’s age based on their behavior, age verification, as well as parental controls. The tests also took into account the ways teenagers might try to circumvent age checks..“We found a plethora of approaches that fit different use cases in different ways, but we didn’t find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,” the trial said in its statement..More than 50 companies participated in the trial, while Apple Inc. and Google, developers of the most popular mobile-phone operating systems, are also contributing, Allen said on a video conference call on Friday..The trial didn’t assess public acceptance for any particular technology or the costs involved.

2025-06-20 03:15:00,Alphabet Lags 'Magnificent 7--But AI Breakthrough Could Be the Game-Changer,Alphabet's Grip on Search Holds Tight as AI Rivals Circle,"June 19 - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) hasn't kept pace with its Magnificent Seven peers lately, its stock dipped 2% over the past year and down nearly 8% so far in 2025. Investors have been jittery about rising AI competition and what it might mean for Google's search ad dominance..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN..But peel back the headlines, and Google still runs the show. Search remains sticky, really sticky. Even when paid to switch to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, most users went right back to Google, according to a recent Wharton study. It's not just brand loyalty, it's decades of data, personal preferences, and deep integration across products like Maps, YouTube, and Chrome that make switching feel like a downgrade..And while ChatGPT and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) AI are gaining ground, Google's own Gemini platform is catching up fast. It now has 350 million monthly users, skyrocketing from just 9 million last October thanks to rollout across Gmail and Search. Behind the scenes, Alphabet's in-house TPUs give it a serious cost advantage over AI players relying on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) pricey chips..On the numbers side, Alphabet looks solid. Revenue grew 13% over the past 12 months through March, with operating margins climbing to nearly 33%. Google Cloud led the way with 30% growth and major margin gains.

2025-06-20 01:36:00,"The Week in AI: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked.""","A new civil war in AI, Andreessen's rant, and Zuck splashes the pot.","Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.""CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA NVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in ""the revolution"" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up after Apple AAPL researchers released their paper ""The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.""We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models ""give up"" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply ""token prediction"" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the ""vibe-coding"" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the ""limitations"" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled ""The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking."" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the ""top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted"" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article ""This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.""And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work ""as fast as possible""...""Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.""Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the ""Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.""I have several posts in the comments of the ""The Week in AI"" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.""Translation: AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: ""The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle."" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled ""The Gentle Singularity.""I call it his ""love letter"" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a ""symbiosis between people and AI"" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of ""post-labor economics"" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the ""not-so-gentle"" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be ""hip.""On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing that Alphabet GOOGL is ""firing on all cylinders across AI"" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last ""search is dead"" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta Platforms META plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be ""mined and modeled"" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough, Advanced Micro Devices AMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...""The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?""It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.""I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer ""thinking."" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other ""intelligence experts"" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line: To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alphabet (GOOGL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms.

Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>.While the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-considered-good-investment-133013677.html

According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-alphabet-goog-133011105.html
2025-06-19 18:30:00,Magnificent 7 May Need to Make Room for Broadcom,"Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club late last year, and its market cap has only continued to climb since.","Broadcom joined the trillion-dollar club late last year, and its market value has continued to climb since. The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: Novo Nordisk Backs Away From Hims & Hers Partnership and Fiserv Connecting Thousands of Banks to Crypto with New Stablecoin Platform.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

But that doesn't mean there aren't good values to be found. While there are some fears that a bubble will form in AI, many of the big tech stocks leading the charge look downright undervalued. In fact, some of them even fall into the classic Warren Buffett model of value investing..Buffett is known for avoiding tech stocks for most of his career, but there are some AI-related tech stocks that even a value investor like him could get behind. Keep reading for details about two of them..OpenAI may be the most buzzworthy AI company, but there's no question that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a leader in AI. The company has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for at least a decade, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, and launching Google Brain, which merged with DeepMind in 2023, before that..The company has made AI a stated priority for at least eight years, and it's kept pace with advances in generative AI with Google Gemini, its AI model, and its AI assistant that is readily available on Google Search..In addition to the company's prowess in AI technology, the stock's valuation is also attractive at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 20, meaning it trades at more than a 20% discount to the S&P 500..Investors seem to be wary of the stock because of pressure on the regulatory front and concerns that generative AI chatbots pose a threat to the dominance of Google Search..The regulatory concerns might seem valid after the company was found in court to have a monopoly in both search and ad tech, and the company is now awaiting a decision on ""remedies"" for the search business, while its remedies trial for ad tech is set for September. Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in..It's true that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity pose a threat to Google Search, but thus far, Google has held its own, continuing to grow..In fact, growth in the business has been steady, and Google Cloud has also turned profitable. Overall, its competitive advantages remain intact, and its valuation is attractive.

(NASDAQ:GOOG). The case began with Cofeco’s claim that Google forces advertisers to operate through its services across both search and third-party sites. If the claim had been true, it would have meant that Google gained an unfair advantage over its competitors in the digital advertising sector. The unfair advantage was claimed to stem from the design of Google’s platform for buying online advertising..everything possible/Shutterstock.com.This relieves Google of paying up to 8% of its annual revenue from Mexico as a fine. The scale of this potential antitrust fine can be understood from Google’s revenue from Latin America for 2024, which totals over $20 billion. Alphabet Inc.

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Push for 10-Year Regulatory Freeze",A secretive AI lobbying blitz backed by tech giants could silence state laws--and reshape the future of innovation,"Big Tech is making a big betand investors are watching. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pushing for a 10-year nationwide ban that would block U.S. states from regulating artificial intelligence. The proposal, already tucked into the House version of Trump's budget bill, is being sold as a way to avoid a messy patchwork of state-level rules that could slow innovation and leave the U.S. trailing China. Their message: keep regulation federal, uniform, and minimalfor now. The lobbying effort is backed by INCOMPAS, a trade group representing tech heavyweights, which launched the AI Competition Center this year to drive home that point. Chip Pickering, INCOMPAS CEO, said the move is about safeguarding America's lead in AI..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN..But not everyone's buying that narrative. Criticsincluding academics, policy analysts, and even some in Silicon Valleyargue this could be less about innovation and more about locking in dominance. MIT's Max Tegmark called it a power grab, while voices from the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator warned that defanging state oversight now could make AI's societal risks harder to manage later. Even within the GOP, there's friction. Some Republicans like Thom Tillis see the merit in avoiding 50 conflicting rulebooks. Others, like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Josh Hawley, say tying states' hands for a decadewhen no one knows where AI is headedcould backfire hard..The Senate is now weighing how to fit this moratorium into a budget reconciliation bill, which bypasses the need for Democratic votes. Senator Ted Cruz has floated a workaround: cut broadband funding to states that refuse to comply. But the clock is ticking, and the political ground is far from firm.

On the surface, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence..However, over the last couple of weeks, Tesla stock has started to witness some new life -- save for a brief sell-off following a fleeting tiff between Elon Musk and President Trump..While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback during the second half of the year..Let's explore a major update coming to Tesla soon and understand how this could fuel shares to new all-time highs. Is now the time to pounce on Tesla stock? Read on to find out..Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs. Rather, Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla..Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software. Tesla plans to leverage self-driving software across two applications: offering it as a feature in its cars and building a fleet of robotaxis for ride-hailing services..While the initial launch date for the Tesla Robotaxi was rumored to be June 12, more recent commentary from Musk himself suggests that the first rides will take place in Austin, Texas, later this month (potentially between June 22 and 28)..A successful robotaxi launch represents a transformative shift in Tesla -- from primarily a car manufacturer to more of an AI-powered services provider disrupting ride-hailing, car rentals, or logistics businesses..When it comes to popular stocks in the AI realm, I'm sure cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon come to mind. Moreover, given Nvidia's ongoing rollout of its new Blackwell GPU architecture, the semiconductor king appears well positioned for further growth, too..Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AI capital expenditures (capex) just this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-220000899.html

In 2025, that trend is set to continue..Amazon has projected it will spend roughly $105 billion, much higher than its peers, with the vast majority going to AI infrastructure for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services. Microsoft is set to spend $80 billion in 2025 to build out AI data centers..Amazon and Microsoft have both announced layoffs in recent years.

Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports the latest on Waymo and VW’s (VWAGY) electric ID. Buzz..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here..Well, Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable, bringing its robo taxi service to the streets of New York City. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian here with more details in the story. I I mean, just personally, I can't wait to get in a Waymo and take it around the city. So is it how quickly is this happening? What's the steps, what are the steps that have to happen? .So, you're saying they apply for a permit to begin tests next month. Now, there'll be a safety driver in the driver seat, so you're not going to be alone in the car, but it should ostensibly drive on its own, like it has in LA, San Francisco, Austin right now. Uh, it should be I mean, I'm I was surprised to hear that they're going to be doing this this soon. I think it's kind of shows you how far the technology's come and how confident they are that they can come to New York City where you have cyclists and pedestrians and just people and you know, bikes everywhere. It's just a kind of a wild scene to think about. But yeah, it's coming here next month and it kind of speaks to their global or their continue expansion, uh more places in LA, more places in San Francisco. So, yeah, this is the next big step for them. .Do we have any line of sight, by the way, I'm just curious, what regulators would have to see, Pras, to get comfortable getting that human out of the car, going full robot? .Yeah, I'm not sure. I believe it's it's that New York does not allow a car to be operated without a driver in the seat. I think it'll kind of maybe show a decent record of safety that'll allow them to change regulations to allow full robo taxi deployment, or as they call unsupervised, uh in in New York. You know, so, as Waymo does this in New York City, Tesla is beginning their robo taxi tests in Austin, but unsupervised, meaning there will be no safety driver in the driver's seat. There'll be a person sitting in the passenger seat and tell operators in case anything needs to be done. So, it's a little bit of a distinction there. A little uh a little odd kind of change, because think about Tesla hasn't proven anything yet from a robo taxi point of view. Where Waymo is being extra careful, uh with that right now. .So you'll get in the car in for the Tesla and somebody will be in the passenger seat already. .In this small test they're doing, yeah. .Interesting. Wasn't there other autonomous tech news today, a Volkswagen backed company? .Yeah, earlier today Volkswagen, uh has this startup called Mio, I think they're called. And basically they came up with this uh, you're looking at it, it's an ID version of their ID Buzz minivan, electric minivan, but but fit for robo taxi use using using um uh different software suite plus sensors, uh plus a sort of bespoke mobility platform that allow operators to buy these vans in bulk and and then then deploy them as robo taxis and Uber will be their partner initially for some parts of the US. So, yeah, this is an interesting concept here. Or it's an actual vehicle that VW is using right now in Hamburg, Germany. And they want to bring it around to the US too. .I like the the paint job on the outside of this. Pras, thank you. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/waymo-cars-hitting-nyc-streets-210250045.html

The company announced Wednesday that it has applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation for its vehicles to operate autonomously with a “trained specialist” behind the wheel in Manhattan..Waymo says it does plan to eventually introduce a self-driving service for paid rides in New York City, even if the company doesn’t have a time frame for bringing it to the streets of the nation’s largest and most traffic-ridden city. It called the test “an important step towards one day serving New Yorkers.”.Waymo last deployed its cars in New York in 2021. But that was only a test for data collection and weather testing while a human actually drove the vehicle, the company said..This year’s deployment in the nation’s most congested city will still be a test, but “if the permit is granted, (Waymo) would be (New York City)’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles,” the company said..Shares of Lyft (LYFT) and Uber (UBER) both fell following the announcement..Waymo already provides more than 250,000 paid rides a week without a human driver in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. But it is illegal in New York state to operate a car without a person ready to take control of the vehicle to avoid an accident. Waymo also announced it will begin pushing for a change to that state law. And any company offering a self-driving system officially requires approval from New York City, human driver or not..Waymo has partnered with Uber to provide the service in Phoenix and Austin, and is operating robotaxis itself in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It plans to soon be in Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC. In addition, Tesla has announced plans to start its own “robotaxi” service in Austin this Sunday, with plans to expand to other cities in the “coming months.” Tesla, however has been promising its widespread robotaxi service was only “a year away” since 2019..Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk insists that providing robotaxi services will produce massive profits and an increased share price for his company. But profitable self-driving car services have thus far remained elusive for other providers..Alphabet does not disclose the financial performance of Waymo. But the segment of the company that includes Waymo reported a $4.1 billion loss last year, even as Alphabet poured in $5.6 billion. That loss is little more than a rounding error for a company that reported net income of $100 billion in 2024.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-returning-nyc-still-needs-182338571.html

2025-06-19 01:25:00,Waymo applies for special permit to bring its self-driving cars to New York City,Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable: bringing its robotaxi service to the streets of New York City.,"Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable: bringing its robotaxi service to the streets of New York City next month..""We've applied for a @NYC_DOT permit to drive autonomously with a specialist behind the wheel while we're in the city — a key step to one day serving New Yorkers,"" the Alphabet-backed (GOOG, GOOGL) company said in a post on X..Waymo said it is also advocating for changes to state law to bring its fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future. New York's busy streets, with vehicles, pedestrians, bikers, and all sorts of delivery drivers, are seen as one of the most challenging terrains for a rototaxi operator..Waymo's announcement of a future New York City-based service comes amid a planned nationwide expansion. The company operates in parts of San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin, and just announced it was expanding service in greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area..Tesla (TSLA), which is slated to begin its robotaxi testing in Austin starting next week, will not use safety drivers in its cars when its test begins but will have remote teleoperators available. Two Tesla robotaxis were seen testing in Austin last week, but Tesla employees were sitting in the passenger seat..Waymo, the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 trips per week, counts competitors like Zoox (backed by Amazon (AMZN)), China's Pony AI (PONY) and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla, though none operate in as many regions or perform as many autonomous rides as Waymo. Volkswagen's MOIA revealed its ID. Buzz AD robotaxi in Germany this week. However, its vehicles plan to use other operators' platforms, like Uber, to deploy its vehicles..Waymo's expansion counts on its ability to manufacture more vehicles, which the company said will expand to 2,500 vehicles in the near future. Though that production is much smaller compared to what a traditional automaker like Tesla or VW can produce, Waymo is countering that issue by partnering with manufacturers like Toyota and China's Zeekr..Pras Subramanian is the lead auto reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2025-06-19 00:59:00,Waymo has set its robotaxi sights on NYC,Waymo said it's working on a return to New York City and its first step it applying for a permit.,"Waymo said Wednesday it has applied for a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the Alphabet company’s first step in a sticky regulatory process to bring its robotaxis to U.S.’s largest city..Waymo applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate its self-driving Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with a human safety operator behind the wheel in Manhattan. New York’s autonomous vehicle demonstration or testing permit requires a human driver to be able to take over; a $5 million insurance policy; and every test vehicle operator must be adequately trained in the safe operation of the test vehicle..New York law is especially prohibitive of autonomous vehicles. While securing a permit would be notable, Waymo is far from being able to launch commercial operations in the city — or even test without a human safety operator behind the wheel..Still, Waymo is pressing forward and said it’s advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel. The company is also trying to build goodwill in NYC and the state by working with several organizations such as MADD NY, YAI, National Federation of the Blind, and the Bronx Community College..Waymo told TechCrunch it has had positive conversations with lawmakers this year and hopes to keep making progress on regulatory changes. New York law states that any person operating a motor vehicle must have at least one hand (or prosthetic) on the steering mechanism at all times. Changing that wording will be key to Waymo eventually being able to deploy driverless vehicles..Other companies have tried to test in NYC before, including Mobileye and the now shuttered Cruise. But these efforts never materialized beyond a few demonstrations or pilots..Of course, New York City has other challenges beyond regulations. The city is chock-a-block with cars, trucks, delivery vans, bicycles, buses, and, importantly, people, all of whom are scuttling about. San Francisco, one of the markets that Waymo operates in today, is also a bustling city with many of the same challenges. NYC takes that complexity to a factor of 10..Waymo has eyed the massive market of NYC for years. In 2021, the company deployed its now retired Chrysler Pacifica minivans — the first self-driving vehicles in its testing fleet — to manually drive and map Manhattan. The company said at the time that each vehicle would have two people, one to drive and another in the passenger seat to help direct the activity of the driver, monitor the software on the vehicle in real time, evaluate the performance, and log comments.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-set-robotaxi-sights-nyc-165904482.html

The company expects the plant will create hundreds of jobs in the region as it grows..“The reality is we are just ready,” Zoox Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech on Wednesday. The strategy is to start “putting the capacity in place and then turning it on little by little as we go city by city” with commercial launches, she said..Zoox is one of several companies vying to secure a foothold in the market for autonomous ridehailing. Competitors include Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit and Tesla Inc., which plans to begin offering rides in Austin with no driver behind the wheel as early as Sunday..The Amazon-owned company’s purpose-built robotaxi is akin to a shuttle and has no steering wheel or pedals, with four inward-facing seats. Zoox would need an exemption from US auto safety rules that require vehicles to have driver controls, though the Trump administration has said it’s working on changes to provide those approvals faster..Zoox is “very grateful” to the administration’s work in preparing the US for robotaxis and talks with regulatory bodies are “going well”, Evans said..Zoox is testing or operating robotaxis on a limited basis in San Fransisco and Las Vegas, where it plans to launch its service. Waymo, which uses vehicles made by other automakers that it rigs with self-driving software and sensors, is seen as the market leader and charges fares for rides in multiple US markets..To start, Zoox has a dozen of its robotaxis driving on the Las Vegas Strip, Evans said.

Buzz as a donor vehicle, MOIA says it will create a “turnkey solution” for those looking for an autonomous production vehicle, the company said from an event in Hamburg, Germany..MOIA’s offering uses LiDAR, cameras, and radar combined with Mobileye’s self-driving system and the company’s own Autonomous Driving Mobility as a Service (AD MaaS) platform. MOIA said its AD MaaS software uses AI to manage fleets in real time and integrates into existing booking apps..In addition, the system meets key regulatory requirements for SAE Level 4 automated vehicles, MOIA said, using additional features like remote supervision and safe handling of emergency interventions on the streets..MOIA’s all-in-one offering — car, self-driving software, and robotaxi platform — comes as Tesla (TSLA) prepares to begin its robotaxi test in Austin in a few days..“Beginning in 2026, we will bring sustainable, autonomous mobility to large-scale deployment in Europe and the US, another milestone on our path to becoming a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen Group CEO, in a statement..VW claims the “MOIA Turnkey Solution” can be implemented by large commercial fleet operators, and the ID. Buzz AD will be deployed on Uber's platform starting next year in Los Angeles..VW believes the ID. Buzz is a strong choice for robotaxi use. It features an extended wheelbase and raised roof for added space, sliding electric doors for ease of entry, four separate seats, and storage space both up front and in the rear..“The ID. Buzz AD is purpose-built for autonomous mobility services. It’s a cabin designed entirely around passenger needs – and the realities of driverless ridepooling or ridehailing,” Christian Senger, CEO of Volkswagen Autonomous Mobility said in a statement to Yahoo Finance..VW and MOIA did not say how much the vehicle would cost when it goes on sale. It is estimated that similar vehicles, like Waymo’s (GOOG) bespoke Jaguar I-PACE, cost upwards of $100,000, though as one of the largest automakers in the world, VW may be able to save money since it owns the ID. Buzz platform and has advantages of scale..Waymo, the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 trips a week, announced it is expanding service in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and just revealed it is bringing service to New York City (but with a safety driver). And it's countering the cost issue by partnering with manufacturers like Toyota and China’s Zeekr.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vw-to-sell-id-buzz-robotaxis-next-year-taking-on-tesla-and-waymo-161953142.html

The company plans to begin collecting data and evaluating its technology in the city starting next month, regardless of the permit outcome..Waymo currently offers fully autonomous, paid rides in several major U.S. cities including Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix, and San Francisco. The company is also expanding its partnership with Uber, with plans to offer autonomous trips through Uber’s platform in Atlanta later this summer, followed by Miami and Washington next year..However, Waymo faces significant regulatory hurdles in New York, where state law doesn’t currently allow for fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing services. The city is known for its challenging urban street environment and stringent regulations on taxi and rideshare services..The autonomous vehicle company is actively seeking regulatory changes in New York, particularly the ability to operate vehicles with no human behind the wheel. This potential expansion into the lucrative New York market appears to have sparked investor concerns about future competition for established ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, which have historically navigated complex regulatory relationships with the city..Related articles.Uber and Lyft stock fall after Waymo applies for NYC testing permit.Barclays and Santander are potential bidders for Banco Sabadell’s TSB unit.Pernod Ricard plans reorganization into two main brand divisions",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-lyft-stock-fall-waymo-164450727.html
2025-06-19 00:00:00,Google’s AI Mode can now have back-and-forth voice conversations,Google is rolling out the ability for users to have a back-and-forth voice conversation with AI Mode.,"Google is rolling out the ability for users to have a back-and-forth voice conversation with AI Mode, its experimental Search feature that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions. With the new Search Live integration, users can have a free-flowing voice conversation with Search and explore links from across the web..Users will be able to access the feature by opening the Google app and tapping the new “Live” icon to ask their question aloud. They will then hear an AI-generated audio response, and they can follow up with another question..Today’s announcement comes a few weeks after Google rolled out AI Mode to everyone in the U.S. The launch of the feature was seen as Google’s answer to popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. With this new update, Google is looking to take on those services’ respective voice modes..Google says the feature will be useful in instances where you’re on the go or multitasking. For example, if you’re packing for a trip, you can ask a question like “What are some tips for preventing a linen dress from wrinkling in a suitcase?” You could follow up with another question like “What should I do if it still wrinkles?”.As you’re having the conversation, you’ll find links right on your screen if you want to dig deeper into your search..Because Search Live works in the background, you can continue the conversation while in another app. Plus, you have the option to tap the “transcript” button to view the text response and continue to ask questions by typing if you’d like to. You can also revisit a Search Live response by navigating to your AI Mode history..“Behind the scenes, Search Live in AI Mode uses a custom version of Gemini with advanced voice capabilities,” Liza Ma, the director of product management at Google Search, explained in a blog post. “Our custom model is built on Search’s best-in-class quality and information systems, so you still get reliable, helpful responses no matter where or how you’re asking your question. Search Live with voice also uses our query fan-out technique to show you a wider and more diverse set of helpful web content, enabling new opportunities for exploration.”.In the coming months, Google plans to bring more Live capabilities to AI Mode, including letting you ask questions based on what your phone’s camera is seeing in real time, as was previewed at Google I/O in May.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ai-mode-now-back-160000827.html

The ChatGPT maker was already in the process of winding down its reliance on Scale before Meta, an OpenAI competitor, took a 49% stake in the firm, the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data needed to support increasingly advanced artificial intelligence models..OpenAI’s plans inject new uncertainty into Scale’s business in the wake of Meta’s unusual deal. Meta is investing $14.3 billion in Scale and has poached the startup’s chief executive officer, Alexandr Wang, for a new so-called “superintelligence” unit, focused on building a more powerful, and hypothetical, form of AI software. Other Scale employees are expected to follow Wang to Meta to work on AI..A Scale AI spokesperson declined to comment..Founded in 2016, Scale signed up prominent customers, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta and OpenAI, providing them with the data needed to build AI models. However, Meta’s deal with Scale raised concerns that the social-media company may gain new visibility into its rivals’ AI development efforts. Google plans to cut ties with Scale, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.Right after the Meta deal was announced, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar had signaled that the company intended to keep working with Scale. “We don’t want to ice the ecosystem because acquisitions are going to happen,” Friar said at the VivaTech conference in Paris last week.Over the past six to 12 months, however, OpenAI had determined that Scale was not the best fit for it because the AI developer needed more data expertise than Scale could provide, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI has shifted to building more advanced AI models that can mimic the process of human reasoning, as well as agent-like models that can carry out tasks with limited input from users. Forbes previously reported OpenAI had been winding down its Scale work for months.Scale initially focused on working with an army of contractors to do the grunt work of labeling text and images for earlier AI systems. Scale has gradually enlisted better-paid contractors with doctorates, nursing and other advanced degrees to help develop more sophisticated models.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-phasing-scale-ai-following-150114302.html

Within its operational zones, Waymo is forecast to achieve 16% penetration overall and 22% in its currently announced markets..Analysts believe rapid Waymo market expansion to 42% of U.S. rideshare markets by 2028 and reaching 5.4% U.S. market penetration, coupled with pricing growth headwinds, caps upside to Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft’s U.S. gross bookings growth..While 30% of Waymo rides are expected to be incremental to the overall market, Wells Fargo anticipates minimal incrementality from additional autonomous vehicle entrants..“Prospects for Uber &  Lyft  to serve as key demand partners for AV suppliers have dimmed recently as Waymo appears thus far to be going it alone in all announced TBD/2026 markets,” the analysts noted..However, they noted that longer term, there may be opportunities for Uber and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to help drive higher utilization of autonomous fleets..Still, Waymo’s expected growth is likely to have material implications for industry leaders Uber and Lyft. By 2030, Wells Fargo forecasts Uber and Lyft will lose 5 and 4 percentage points of market share, respectively..It estimates that 30% of Waymo’s rides will be incremental to the industry, while the remaining 70% will come at the expense of existing players..Pricing trends are also projected to change as the sector matures and becomes more competitive. Wells Fargo projects rideshare pricing will remain flat through 2030, a slowdown from the 3% annual growth seen between 2021 and 2024. That pressure on pricing is expected to weigh on profitability..“We forecast 2026/27 UBER total incremental EBITDA margins of 7.6% and 6.8%, below our 2025 estimate of 8.5%,” the analysts wrote.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-waymo-seen-capturing-10-113210166.html

But here's the good news: The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) offers investors a simple way to buy them all, with a splash of diversification..It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and the Magnificent Seven account for over half of the total value of its entire portfolio. Here's how the ETF could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the next 15 years (or less)..The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which invests in the top 70% of the cumulative market capitalization of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index. The CRSP U.S. Total Market Index holds each of the 3,537 stocks listed on American exchanges..The U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index (and by extension, the Vanguard ETF) only holds 69 stocks, which highlights the incredible concentration of wealth in corporate America. To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the entire value of the 3,537 companies listed on American stock exchanges..It isn't entirely surprising considering the Magnificent Seven stocks have a combined market capitalization of $17 trillion, which they have accumulated by dominating various subsegments of the technology industry including cloud computing, semiconductors, e-commerce, social media, and electric vehicles..As a result, the Magnificent Seven stocks alone represent 56.3% of the total value of the Vanguard ETF's portfolio of 69 stocks:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stocks-could-help-085600953.html

Buffett rarely invests in tech stocks, but he has made some exceptions for quality names like Apple and Amazon.  There is another tech giant ticking almost all of Buffett's boxes right now, and it's a clear leader in the AI industry.","Warren Buffett's simple investing strategy has steered Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns for six decades..Buffett rarely invests in tech stocks, but he has made some exceptions for quality names like Apple and Amazon..There is another tech giant ticking almost all of Buffett's boxes right now, and it's a clear leader in the AI industry..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.In May, Warren Buffett announced that he plans to step down from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) at the end of 2025. It will cap off a spectacular run of success that dates back to 1965 -- though his journey isn't over completely, because he will continue to serve as chairman of Berkshire's board..Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock when Buffett took the helm 60 years ago and held on for that entire time, you'd have been sitting on shares worth an eye-popping $44.7 million at the end of 2024. The same investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period. Part of that growth came from the dozens of businesses that the conglomerate purchased in their entirety over the years, but the rest was driven by the incredible stock-picking of Buffett and his team..Buffett uses a simple strategy, and as a general rule, he tends to avoid buying shares of companies whose businesses he doesn't understand. As a result, he doesn't invest in technology stocks very often, and he certainly doesn't chase hot trends like artificial intelligence (AI)..However, there is one AI stock that could be a great fit in Berkshire's portfolio because it meets most of Buffett's investment criteria, and he has even expressed regret for not investing in it during its early years..Buffett is a value investor who likes to buy good companies when they are trading cheap, but he doesn't shy away from picking up shares of spectacular companies at a fair price..When considering a potential investment, Buffett looks for companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams. He also likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback programs. But time is Buffett's most important weapon because compound growth amplifies his results over the long term -- he has often been quoted as saying his preferred holding period is forever..Buffett oversees numerous wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, including Duracell, Dairy Queen, and GEICO Insurance. But he also helps manage its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, which currently includes holdings in 38 companies and is worth around $278 billion today. As I mentioned earlier, he generally avoids technology stocks like those in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but he has made exceptions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-isnt-081600959.html
2025-06-18 13:00:00,Why the UK's AIM is struggling 30 years on,The UK's alternative investment market has seen some major successes since launching 30 years ago but has recently struggled to attract and retain companies.,"The UK's alternative investment market (AIM) has seen some major successes since its inception 30 years ago but has struggled to attract and retain companies in recent years..Launched on 19 June 1995, AIM was set up to help smaller and high-growth companies get more access to capital. When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L). ""As a result, we’re seeing many of the biggest and best AIM companies moving to a main market listing.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-uk-aim-struggling-alternative-investment-050024609.html

Back in April, Meta Platforms (META) delivered a blockbuster Q1, with a $42.32 billion revenue haul, up 16%, driven by AI-powered ad growth. The momentum seems to be going strong throughout Q2, with Meta recently announcing a $14.3 billion investment for a 49% stake in Scale AI, which will further solidify its leadership in the space. Meta also wants to have Scale CEO Alexandr Wang, spearhead a superintelligence lab. Let’s unpack why this deal could be transformative for Meta..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.Meta is experiencing strong momentum in the AI space. In Q1, the company reported a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad pricing, driven by enhanced targeting capabilities across Reels and Stories on Instagram and Facebook, which now serve a combined 3.43 billion daily active users. Meta AI, positioned as a competitor to ChatGPT, is approaching one billion monthly users and is already powering personalized content feeds and early-stage trials of AI-integrated smart glasses, highlighting Meta’s unparalleled global reach..The potential addition of Scale AI, a leading data-labeling company valued at $29 billion, could further accelerate Meta’s AI innovation. Scale AI generated $870 million in revenue last year and is on track to reach $2 billion this year, underscoring its significant role in refining machine learning models. When added to META’s revenues, Scale appears value accretive..Scale’s capabilities could directly support Meta’s AI infrastructure and enhance applications like WhatsApp Business, which now serves over 100 million businesses and is expected to become a key driver of revenue growth as AI-driven customer engagement tools gain traction. For instance, AI-powered chatbots that anticipate customer needs could help small businesses drive sales. Additionally, Scale’s data assets might elevate Meta’s Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, enabling advanced features such as real-time translation or navigation that could rival offerings from competitors like Google’s Gemini..The decision to acquire a 49% non-voting stake in Scale AI appears to be a strategic move, particularly in an environment where regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech remains intense. Meta’s prior acquisitions—such as Instagram and WhatsApp—continue to attract attention from antitrust authorities, and a full acquisition of Scale could have raised similar concerns. By allowing Scale to operate independently, Meta avoids potential antitrust issues while still gaining access to the company’s talent, led by CEO Alexandr Wang, and its valuable data infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-bets-14-230500025.html

This can cause the AI’s performance to experience “qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability,” according to the report..AI benchmarking — or, the process of comparing the performance of different AI models — is a dubious art that often provides little context for the actual capabilities of a given model. But some researchers think that studying how AI models play video games could be useful (or, at the very least, kind of funny)..Over the last several months, two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic have set up respective Twitch streams called “Gemini Plays Pokémon” and “Claude Plays Pokémon,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago..Each stream displays the AI’s “reasoning” process — or, a natural language translation of how the AI evaluates a problem and arrives at a response — giving us insight into the way that these models work..While the progress of these AI models is impressive, they are still not very good at playing Pokémon. It takes hundreds of hours for Gemini to reason through a game that a child could complete in exponentially less time..What’s interesting about watching an AI navigate a Pokémon game is not so much about its time of completion, but rather how it behaves along the way..“Over the course of the playthrough, Gemini 2.5 Pro gets into various situations which cause the model to simulate ‘panic,'” the report says..This state of “panic” can result in the model’s performance getting worse, as the AI may suddenly stop using certain tools at its disposal for a stretch of gameplay. While AI does not think or experience emotion, its actions mimic the way in which a human might make poor, hasty decisions when under stress — a fascinating, yet unsettling response..“This behavior has occurred in enough separate instances that the members of the Twitch chat have actively noticed when it is occurring,” the report says..Claude has also exhibited some curious behaviors in its journeys across Kanto. In one instance, the AI picked up on the pattern that when all of its Pokémon run out of health, the player character will “white out” and return to a Pokémon Center.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-gemini-panicked-playing-pok-205319439.html

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., IBM Corp. and RTX Corp., as well as a micro-cap stock National Presto Industries, Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Ahead of Wall StreetThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company's increasing litigation issues are a concern. Intensifying competition from Microsoft and Amazon in cloud computing is a headwind.Nevertheless, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions. The company expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.Alphabet's dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)IBM's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+68.5% vs. +1.2%). The company is likely to benefit from heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management.A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and investments in growth opportunities will likely boost profitability. IBM is betting big on the watsonx platform, which is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Strategic acquisitions to boost portfolio is a positive.However, buyouts have negatively impacted the company's balance sheet in the form of high level of goodwill and net intangible assets. IBM's Consulting business is affected soft demand in some end markets and macroeconomic headwinds. A high debt burden remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>>)Shares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+42.4% vs. +16.2%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products, from the Pentagon and its foreign allies. This resulted in RTX registering a robust defense backlog of $92 billion as of March 31, 2025.Steadily improving commercial air traffic worldwide has also been boosting the company's sales. The company also holds a solid solvency position, at least in the short term.However, the uncertainties created by the recent imposition of U.S. government-issued import tariffs and the counter-tariffs from other nations pose a risk for RTX. Supply-chain challenges continue to affect the aerospace sector, which may adversely affect RTX's performance. The stock's forward 12-month EV/SALES ratio is unimpressive when compared to its industry.(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)National Presto Industries' shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+31% vs. +6.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $680.92 million is strategically positioned to capitalize on rising U.S. defense spending and global geopolitical tensions. Its Defense segment, aligned with key Department of Defense priorities such as Ukraine resupply and autonomous systems, benefits from a growing $1.2 billion contract backlog extending through 2029, supporting long-term revenue visibility.Vertically integrated operations enhance quality and cost control, solidifying its role as a sole-source contractor on several 40mm systems. Q1 2025 results show robust earnings growth driven by a 47% sales surge in Defense. Recent investments, including a $19.8 million logistics facility, bolster operational resilience in its Housewares segment.However, risks remain, such as heavy reliance on DoD contracts, tariff-driven margin pressures in Housewares, a cybersecurity breach, and continued underperformance in the Safety segment.(You can read the full research report on National Presto Industries here >>>)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-alphabet-140600952.html

(ORCL) investors find themselves at a pivotal crossroads. Either heed the warning from a growing list of indicators that suggest the stock has run up too far, too fast — or continue to chase another rally that’s been supercharged by lofty artificial intelligence expectations..Most Read from Bloomberg.Security Concerns Hit Some of the World’s ‘Most Livable Cities’.As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space.As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage.How E-Scooters Conquered (Most of) Europe.Shares of the software maker have soared 75% from April’s low, including their best two-day gain since 2001 after its earnings report last week showed AI-fueled revenue growth is gaining steam. However, that’s left the stock trading at it most overbought level in 25 years and at its steepest valuation in more than two decades. And there are signs investors may already be balking..Oracle shares fell nearly 1% in premarket trading Tuesday as the Israel-Iran conflict drags on. That follows a nearly 2% decline on Monday, a day that saw the broader Nasdaq 100 Index rally 1.4%..Last week’s $116 billion rally has shifted the focus to Oracle’s execution, according to Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. Its growth opportunity from AI reminds Morgan of Microsoft Corp.’s push into cloud computing in the last decade or even Nvidia Corp.’s data center business in 2023..“That could end up being too optimistic, but I think Oracle is in its teenager phase, not yet mature,” Morgan said. “We could maybe look back on this quarter as the moment we all realized how much more there is to come.”.Oracle is best known for its database software but has been investing aggressively in its cloud-computing business. That spending appears to be paying off as the company predicted “dramatically higher” revenue growth for its upcoming fiscal year amid strong demand for AI-related services..Analysts expect that growth rate to be about 16%, up from 8.4% in fiscal 2025, which ended last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income, meanwhile, is expected to rise 15% in fiscal 2026, and expansion in both metrics is projected to accelerate in fiscal 2027..While Oracle’s market share within cloud computing remains below that of bigger players like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), the results were the latest example of the company’s growing strength in AI. Earlier this year, it entered into a joint venture to provide OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) with computing power.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-116-billion-surge-leaves-120558872.html
2025-06-17 18:00:00,"Junk Science Week — Terence Corcoran: When science turns political, trust declines","The junk is not necessarily in the science, but in the ideological streams through which the science flows","For many years now, popular trust in science has been in decline. That conclusion may not pass a rigid science review since most of the evidence comes from polling, which — according to Google’s AI review — lacks scientific rigidity. When asked whether polling is a science, Google AI responded with what looks like a consensus view: “It is both a science and an art.” The science involves using “statistical methods, sampling techniques and social science principles to design and conduct polls that accurately reflect public opinion.” Then comes a big cloud of doubt: “However, the interpretation and application of polling data, as well as the specific strategies used by pollsters, can involve a degree of artistry and political judgment.” Some say polling is “more an art than a science.”.The following is not intended as a put-down of polling, which has its valid processes and uses. The summary definition of polling, however, does somewhat correspond to FP Comment’s standard definition of junk science. Junk science occurs when scientific facts are distorted, risk is exaggerated (or underplayed) and “the science” adapted and warped by politics and ideology to serve another agenda. That definition encompasses a wide range of activities among scientists, NGOs, politicians, journalists, media outlets, cranks and quacks who manipulate science for political, environmental, economic and social purposes. We can now add Artificial Intelligence to the list..The large proportion of science that flows through to the populations of Canada and all countries can, unfortunately, fall into our definition. The array of ideological forces using science to generate public support for social and political causes — or to defeat the same causes — is sowing increasing confusion and distrust..In recent years, poll after poll after poll has produced evidence that public confidence in science has been declining. Back in 2020, University of Alberta professor Tim Caulfield noted that fomenting distrust “has become the go-to strategy for selling health products, generating clicks and getting elected.” The doubts grew as the COVID-19 pandemic raged and as Donald Trump and others on both sides of the political fence engaged in pitched battles over vaccines..The pandemic is said to be a major factor behind the decline of trust in science, especially in the United States where vaccine polarization accelerated with Trump’s appointment of Robert Kennedy Jr. as America’s Secretary of Health, which fuelled more doubt (or so the polls showed), especially on the religious right.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/junk-science-week-terence-corcoran-100027248.html

Here's What That Means for Investors,"The company's cloud computing unit is showing outsized growth, which is only expected to accelerate, making it a major player in the space.  Oracle is shifting from a value stock to a growth stock.  When it comes to cloud computing, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has long been an afterthought to the big three players in the space: Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.","Oracle shares climbed higher as investors cheered the company's strong forecast..The company's cloud computing unit is showing outsized growth, which is only expected to accelerate, making it a major player in the space..Oracle is shifting from a value stock to a growth stock..10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›.When it comes to cloud computing, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has long been an afterthought to the big three players in the space: Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, Oracle is starting to make some noise in the segment and is putting up stats that suggest it is now the fastest grower in the space..Let's delve into Oracle's fiscal Q4 results to see how cloud computing is powering its results and what it means for investors moving forward..While Oracle saw its cloud infrastructure (OCI) revenue soar 52% year over year in its fiscal 2025 Q4 to $3 billion, what got investors excited was the company's forecast that its cloud infrastructure revenue would soar by more than 70% in fiscal 2026. Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison boasted that the company will ""build and operate more cloud infrastructure data centers than all of [its] cloud infrastructure competitors combined."".The company pointed to its strong remaining performance obligations (RPO) as a reason for the confidence in its growth outlook, noting that most of these contracts are non-cancellable. In the quarter, RPO jumped 41% to a whopping $138 billion. It said cloud RPO climbed 56% and is now nearly 80% of its total RPO. More importantly, it is looking for about a third of the RPO to be recognized as revenue over the next year..Oracle said that demand for its OCI services continues to ""dramatically"" outpace supply, with consumption revenue soaring 62% year over year. As such, it plans to increase its capital expenditures (capex) to more than $25 billion in fiscal 2026 to help meet increasing demand. It said most of this spending will be on revenue-generating equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings..The company also highlighted the strength of its cloud database services, which saw revenue climb 31% year over year, and its autonomous database, which saw consumption revenue surge 47%. It said that its database service being accessible across multiple cloud providers gives it a competitive advantage in the market..For its fiscal 2025 Q4 ended May 31, Oracle's overall revenue rose 11% year over year to $15.9 billion, which handily topped the $15.6 billion analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG. Cloud revenue increased 27% year over year to $6.7 billion. Within the cloud segment, cloud infrastructure revenue surged 52% to $3 billion, as mentioned above, while cloud application revenue increased 12% to $3.7 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-pops-company-shows-080000947.html

Fraud related to the Indian government’s instant payment system UPI grew 85% year-over-year to nearly 11 billion Indian rupees ($127 million) last year, per the government’s data. India also saw several instances of digital arrest scams, where fraudsters pose as officials to extort money via video calls and predatory loan apps..With its Safety Charter, Google aims to address some of these areas. The company has also launched its security engineering center in India, its fourth center after Dublin, Munich, and Malaga..Announced at the Google for India summit last year, the security engineering center (GSec) will allow Google to partner with the local community, including government, academia and students, and small and medium enterprises to create solutions to solve cybersecurity, privacy, safety, and AI problems, said Google VP of security engineering Heather Adkins in an interview with TechCrunch..Google has partnered with the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to raise awareness of cybercrimes, the company said in a blog post. This builds upon the company’s existing work, including the launch of its online fraud identification program, DigiKavach, which debuted in 2023 to restrict the harmful effects of malicious financial apps and predatory loan apps..With its GSec in India, Google will focus on three key areas, Adkins told TechCrunch: the phenomenon of online scams and fraud and how people are safe online; the cybersecurity of enterprises, government, and critical infrastructure; and building responsible AI..“These three areas will become part of our safety charter for India, and over the coming years… we want to use the fact that we have engineering capability here to solve for what’s happening in India, close to where the users are,” said Adkins..Globally, Google is utilizing AI to combat online scams and remove millions of ads and ad accounts. The company aims to deploy AI more extensively in India to combat digital fraud..Google Messages, which comes preinstalled on many Android devices, uses AI-powered Scam Detection that has helped protect users from over 500 million suspicious messages a month. Similarly, Google piloted its Play Protect in India last year, which it claims has blocked nearly 60 million attempts to install high-risk apps, resulting in the stopping of more than 220,000 unique apps on over 13 million devices. Google Pay, which is one of the top UPI-based payment apps in the country, also displayed 41 million warnings against transactions suspected to be potential scams.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-scale-ai-powered-fraud-070100010.html

It’s essentially the layers of human feedback that help train AI to evolve and make smarter, safer, more useful choices..💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵.In true tech fashion, though, AI’s human-in-the-loop (HITL) pipelines are turning into a slugfest. At the heart of this showdown is Scale AI, perhaps one of the leading names in the niche..However, that premium position is now under duress with two of the biggest tech giants, Google and Meta Platforms  (META) , at the center of it all..In the latest twist, Google is stepping back while Meta ramps up its role with Scale AI, with the broader narrative of Big Tech guarding its training data like gold..Since its founding in 2016, Scale AI has become one of the key players in fine-tuning the most advanced AI models. Specifically, it delivers the high-fidelity labels needed for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)..Related: Meta commits absurd money to top Google, Microsoft in critical race.Simply put, it’s how humans guide AI by giving feedback so it learns to make better choices..AI bellwethers like OpenAI and Google  (GOOGL)  have leaned on these human-verified datasets, a role OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar recently deemed “critical” in maintaining a healthy AI ecosystem..Naturally, investors took notice..A $100 million boost from Founders Fund in 2019 helped Scale jump past billion-dollar unicorn status. From there, it was off to the races as by 2021, a $325 million Series E had the company valued at a whopping $7.3 billion..Things kicked up a gear in May last year when Accel led a $1 billion round, pushing Scale’s valuation to an eye-watering $13.8 billion with Tiger Global, Index Ventures, and Nvidia all back for more..Now, Meta Platforms, one of the largest spenders on AI, has acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion, valuing the company at nearly $30 billion..The decision risks Scale’s once-enviable positioning by questioning its neutrality, though, with Google, Microsoft, and others retooling their contracts to avoid giving a rival a peek at their playbooks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-plans-major-ai-shift-023300884.html

The company just announced a partnership with OpenAI that would make Alphabet's Google Cloud a computing provider for the ChatGPT creator.,"Despite already being leaders in technology, the internet, and AI, these two companies are striking deals and partnerships to strengthen their positions..By continuously developing and launching various AI features and tools, users and customers are benefiting..Investors aren’t being asked to pay steep valuations to buy these AI stocks..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the topic of discussion these days. It seems that every week, there's a new development happening in the space. This further drives excitement from industry participants and observers. .It's becoming more difficult to argue that AI is just hype. Businesses are investing billions of dollars to position themselves to become AI leaders. Users are finding the various apps to be valuable tools to boost productivity and efficiency..From an investing perspective, it's time to put money to work. Here are two top AI stocks to buy right now..One AI stock to consider adding to your portfolio is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The company just announced a partnership with OpenAI that would make Alphabet's Google Cloud a computing provider for the ChatGPT creator.. Before this, Alphabet announced plans to purchase cloud security company Wiz for $32 billion, in an effort to bolster its security capabilities in an AI era..The other AI stock to purchase today is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Like Alphabet, this business isn't shying away from trying to strike deals of its own. It is reportedly ready to invest $14 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data labeling company..And looking ahead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to keep his foot on Meta's gas pedal. He's trying to put together a team of experts to create AI superintelligence. Scale AI's founder and CEO Alexandr Wang will be on this elite team..Another key reason why both of these dominant businesses are top AI plays is because they have virtually limitless financial resources to push forward. Combined, they had $166 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on their balance sheets as of March 31..Investors know Alphabet and Meta as two powerful tech enterprises. The former owns some of the most widely used internet properties, like Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. The latter runs insanely popular social media apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Both companies have billions of users, giving them unrivaled reach..However, it's not a shock that AI is management's top priority these days. For Alphabet, this means making its crown-jewel search engine more useful. The AI Overviews feature was officially released over a year ago, and it's now being monetized at about the same rate as traditional Search. Perhaps the fears about the search engine market being completely disrupted by AI were overblown.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-000000144.html

2025-06-17 04:00:00,Why Alphabet's AI Infrastructure Makes Today's Price a Bargain,Alphabet's Vertical Integration and Growth Engines Justify a Re-Rating,"So far in 2025, Alphabet (Google) has been the worst performer among the Mag 7, with the stock down about 11% YTD. Since February, I've watched the share price drop hard from around $207 to $141 before bouncing back to about $170 today. While the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, Google has barely clawed back a third of what it lost, which really highlights just how much it's lagging behind the broader market..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with JYD..GOOG Data by GuruFocus.Sure, the broader macro environment has played a role, but I think investors have mostly been spooked by bigger issues like rising fear around AI disrupting Google Search, the antitrust drama in the U.S. about its ad dominance, and newer players like DeepSeek stirring up competitive pressure. On top of that, there's a lot of debate over whether Google is spending too much on AI. Even with all this noise, I personally think Google looks quite attractive here. The company is still growing its revenue at double-digit rates, margins are improving, free cash flow is strong, and the shareholder return is nothing to ignore around 4% annually when you add in buybacks and dividends. At about $170 per share, I see Google as a rare combo of a solid growth business trading at a pretty reasonable price, and in this market, that's not easy to find..One thing that really stands out about Google is how it controls nearly everything in-house. Unlike other AI companies, Google doesn't need to rely on third-party infrastructure. It already has an extensive global network of data centers built out over years to power search, and now it's doubling down by building more of them to support AI. This is a big deal because OpenAI, for example, doesn't have the ability to build these data centers by itself, which is why it's closely partnered with Microsoft..While Microsoft can match Google in terms of investment power, it still relies on OpenAI for models like ChatGPT. That creates a different kind of setup compared to Google's tighter integration between its models (like Gemini) and its own infrastructure. I think this gives Google a real edge when it comes to competing in AI, because it owns the entire tech stack and has direct access to the world's largest information index. It also means Gemini can scale more efficiently and deliver better performance long term since everything runs within Google's own systems. From my point of view, this is a big strategic advantage that I don't think gets enough attention.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-alphabets-ai-infrastructure-makes-200048235.html

We decided if we were going to negotiate, we were going to opt in. We want to be part of this technology,"" she explained..Time has pressed forward with a major reinvention under Sibley, partly by leaning into AI..In 2024, it signed a multiyear deal with OpenAI to give it access to Time's 102-year-old content archive..More recently, the company said it'll launch an on-demand podcast with Meta (META)-backed Scale AI that features two AI hosts summarizing four top stories from its newsletter The Brief..Sibley said the company has been leveraging AI across ""every single department"" to become more efficient, from the newsroom to legal and HR. The push for cost savings comes as Time laid off around 30 staffers in January 2024 and another 22 last August. Sibley cited industry headwinds at the time for the cuts..In the fall, Time expects to enable multilingual, personalized AI interactions on the site, such as AI search, chat, and translation..""The acceleration of how consumers are demanding finding ways of personalized content, multimodal content, and with the AI answer results, we wanted to again embrace it and be part of it as opposed to litigate,"" Sibley said..Time was purchased from Meredith Corporation in September 2018 by Salesforce (CRM) co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, for $190 million in cash. Sibley began as its CEO in November 2022, joining the magazine from Forbes, where she was COO. Prior to Forbes, she held leadership positions at Condé Nast and Bloomberg BusinessWeek..The publication has also expanded its high-profile events business and modernized its tech stack while continuing with its high-quality journalism..To that end, Time named Donald Trump ""Person of the Year"" for 2024 and followed up with a headline-making interview with the president to mark his first 100 days in office..Sibley said in a recent note that Time is forecasting 24% advertising revenue growth in the first half of the year..Other media players are navigating the tricky balance between negotiating and litigating against AI.

2025-06-17 02:50:00,Is Tesla's Robotaxi Dream Just 'Hopium' for TSLA Investors?,"Waymo is off to an early lead over Tesla in the Robotaxi wars. However, Tesla has significant advantages in terms of cost, scalability, and autonomous technology. Can Elon Musk and his team catch up?","Over the past year, EV-pioneer Tesla (TSLA) has got the proverbial “kitchen sink” thrown at it with a plethora of reputational issues and controversies, soft car sales, tariff impacts, and missed deadlines. Some of the problems that the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has faced include:.Elon Musk Reputation: Earlier this year, Tesla faced boycotts and vandalism from the left after CEO Elon Musk became embroiled in political backlash due to his political work under the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) cut government programs like US AID. More recently, Musk faced backlash from the right after getting into a social media spat with President Trump over the “Big Beautiful Bill.” (Musk and Trump have since made amends)..Sales Slump: Tesla sales have fallen across key markets like Europe and China over the past few years while profit margins have declined. Meanwhile, tariff uncertainty has disrupted the Tesla supply chain, threatening to impact gross margins further negatively..Intense Competition: Tesla faces competition from subsidized Chinese competitors like Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO), and BYD (BYDDY), among others..Despite the many challenges Elon Musk and Tesla have had to overcome, the TSLA shares are up about 75% over the past twelve months, trouncing the S&P 500’s 9.3% gains..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The reason for the robust performance is that investors are beginning to discount the Tesla’s long-awaited and delayed Tesla Robotaxi. But are investors suffering from “hopium,” or are they justified in doing so?.Earlier this month, the first driverless Tesla Model Y Robotaxi was spotted in Austin, Texas, the home of CEO Elon Musk. Officially, Musk and the team plan to conduct a limited launch “tentatively” on June 22. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo Robotaxi service has the first-mover advantage over Tesla. Waymo has already launched its geofenced service across several US cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin..With Waymo conducting approximately a quarter million paid Robotaxi rides per week, it’s easy for investors to get lulled into the notion that Waymo will dominate the Robotaxi market. However, Tesla has three distinct advantages, including:.Robotaxi Cost: Unlike Tesla, which mostly relies on AI and cameras for its “Full Self-Driving” capabilities, Waymo relies on expensive lidar technology. In fact, Tesla’s autonomous vehicle cost is ~85% lower than Waymo’s, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence Analysis..Robotaxi Scalability: Waymo aims to manufacture 2,000 Waymo vehicles over the next year. In contrast, Tesla currently produces roughly one million Model Y, FSD-capable vehicles per year. In a recent video, internet personality Farzad Mesbahi explained that “Tesla can manufacture the same amount of Robotaxis that Waymos is looking to manufacture over the next year in about five hours.” .Autonomous Technology: Bloomberg technologyhost Ed Ludlow says, “Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD) technology, while classified as Level 2 like most other vehicles offering autonomous features, could be closer to reaching full autonomy than peers. Tesla’s manufacturing capability is a core differentiator vs Waymo, who faces vehicle production constraints. No other incumbent US or European carmaker offers full self-driving capabilities on city roads.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-dream-just-hopium-185000458.html

The current review could influence timing or require concessions before completion..Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Alphabet's integration plan promises deeper embedding of Wiz's AI models into Google's security stack, but rivals warn that exclusive control over Wiz's roadmap could tilt the playing field..Why it matters: A DOJ challenge or conditions could slow Google's push to differentiate its cloud offering through bespoke security services, potentially leaving enterprises and channel partners in limbo..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-32-billion-wiz-deal-140126623.html

Last week, Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, whose leader is joining a team being assembled by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to pursue artificial general intelligence. That came just after Meta raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as much as $72 billion..“The amount of spending might give some pause, but we’re confident Meta can use AI to drive revenue and accelerate growth,” said Jake Seltz, who manages the Allspring LT Large Growth ETF. “This shows Meta is committed to making the investments it needs to maintain its leadership, and while the stock has had a nice run, we’re still bullish on the long-term opportunity.”.Shares rose 2.6% on Monday. Earlier, the company said it would begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service..Meta’s rally has coincided with a resurgence in trader appetites for AI-related stocks, after the earnings season alleviated fears that Big Tech companies might rein in spending on expensive computing gear. The rebound marks a shift from earlier in the year, when stocks such as Nvidia Corp. tumbled on concerns about AI models developed on the cheap in China..An exchange traded fund that tracks AI stocks including Amazon.com Inc. is up 32% from a low on April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on trading partners, sparking a broad relief rally in stocks. Over that period, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which have gained about 20% and 27%, respectively, as of their last close..Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, bought Meta shares for the first time in recent weeks, in part because of the company’s aggressive spending on AI. He also cited improved operational efficiencies and the shift away from the so-called metaverse, which prompted the company to change its name from Facebook in 2021..“Using AI to optimize the data it has on users for revenue is a clear application, one that allows Meta to play offense while Alphabet is playing defense,” Bond said, referring to concerns that the Google parent could lose market share in the lucrative search business to AI services like ChatGPT. “While AI is expensive, there is good evidence that it is really paying off so far.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-cheer-zuckerberg-doubles-101644156.html
2025-06-16 21:30:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Lead the Next Tech Bull Market,Cloud computing and semiconductor stocks have been at the forefront of the tech bull market throughout the AI revolution.,"For the last few years, the most popular AI stocks were chip companies and cloud hyperscalers..However, infrastructure services are beginning to emerge as a new opportunity in the AI realm..Oracle provides critical cloud-based infrastructure services and sees robust growth ahead..10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›.For much of the last two years, a small concentration of mega-cap artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have played a major role in sending the stock market to new highs. Among the biggest winners were Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms..Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are considered the industry gold standard for generative AI hardware, and cloud hyperscalers and others in big tech just couldn't stop buying these pricey chipsets. While GPUs are still very much in demand, I think a new chapter is quietly unfolding within the broader AI storyline..Let's explore why the AI opportunity is more than just chips. From there, I'll go into detail about why I see Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) as a breakout candidate to lead the next bull market..When the AI revolution kicked off about two-and-a-half years ago, Nvidia was the default option when it came to purchasing GPUs. But over the last couple of years, competition has started to creep into the semiconductor market..Advanced Micro Devices is Nvidia's most direct rival in the AI data center market. However, all the cloud hyperscalers that I referenced above are also investing heavily into custom silicon in an effort to migrate from an AI architecture that's entirely built on Nvidia's backbone..In my view, GPUs aren't becoming less important by any means. However, with the introduction of so many new chips, I do think the semiconductor landscape is becoming commoditized. At this point, AI developers know that they need to keep buying chips. I think the bigger use case for these companies is becoming rooted in figuring out how to manage these GPU clusters amid ongoing AI infrastructure buildouts..This is where Oracle identified an opportunity early on, and the company's results are starting to show a clear pattern..On June 11, Oracle reported earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full 2025 year (ended May 31). For the year, Oracle generated $57.4 billion in revenue -- an increase of 8% year over year. I understand that this growth rate pales in comparison to Nvidia and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-133000808.html

They help with introductions, they help with recruiting, and they help with going public. Some have even been operators themselves and encountered the same problems as their startup founders. But how many full-time VCs can boast that they helped build the biggest tech companies in the world?.There’s Marc Andreessen, of course, and Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla. David Fischer, a partner at 01 Advisors, may not yet have the same name recognition, though he served as a vice president of sales at Google and then chief revenue officer at Facebook as both companies burst out of the stratosphere. And for founders hoping to scale their companies from zero to one in this era of hyper-speed, Fischer’s background may make him as valuable as the giants of Sand Hill Road..I met with Fischer this spring in 01A’s New York office, which is in the same Lower Manhattan building that houses Union Square Ventures and Inspired Capital. Even before Fischer joined the VC ranks during the pandemic, he took a circuitous route into tech. He worked briefly as a journalist before a stint at the Treasury Department for Larry Summers, which is where he met his future boss at Google and Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg. (Fischer’s father, the famed economist and central banker Stanley Fischer, recently passed away.).After attending Stanford Business School, Fischer entered Silicon Valley at a transformative time for the tech sector, joining Google in 2002 right after it launched AdWords and was beginning to bring in revenue. He spent eight years at the search giant before Facebook hired him to pull off the same feat. When Fischer started, Facebook had about 1,200 employees, $750 million in revenue, and had yet to wade into mobile. Its acquisition of Instagram and IPO were still two years away. “Ads were a little bit of an afterthought,” Fischer tells me. When he left in 2021, Facebook’s revenue had topped $100 billion..So, where do you go next? Fischer may not have been in the first 10 or 100 employees at either tech behemoth, but he had experienced the addictive period when a company goes from product-market fit to market domination—and in the case of Google and Facebook, world domination. “I always like to take what I’ve learned before and bring it to do something real and rewarding,” Fischer says..He began to channel that into investing, first as an angel and then connecting with two friends who had started their own firm. Fischer isn’t the only former operator at 01A—the firm was founded by former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, as well as Fischer’s one-time counterpart at Twitter in the CRO role, Adam Bain. Fischer joined full-time for 01A’s third fund, a $395 million vehicle it launched in October 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/term-sheet-next-facebook-former-115039212.html

Friar emphasized the importance of maintaining a diverse vendor ecosystem to support AI development. Meanwhile, Scale’s other key customers like Google, Microsoft, and xAI are reportedly looking to distance themselves from the startup..OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, says the company plans to continue working with Scale AI despite the startup’s recent multi-billion-dollar partnership with rival Meta..“We don’t just buy from Scale,” Friar said at the Viva Technology conference in Paris. “We work with many vendors on the data front.”.“As models have gotten smarter, you’re going into a place where you need real expertise…we have academics and experts telling us that they are finding novel things in their space,” she said. “We don’t want to ice the ecosystem, because acquisitions are going to happen and I think if we ice each other out, I think we’re actually going to slow the pace of innovation.”.Founded in 2016, Scale AI supplies large volumes of labeled and curated training data and works with several major AI companies including Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. On Thursday, Meta announced it was investing $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the startup—a major move for Meta’s AI capabilities but one that reportedly made some of the Big Tech’s competitors wary of using Scale’s services..Scale intends to keep operating as an independent business but with deeper commercial ties to Meta. The company’s CEO Alexandr Wang will also join Meta’s team working on “superintelligence” and be replaced by Jason Droege as interim CEO. Wang will remain on Scale’s board and said in a note to employees he would poach a few “Scalien” employees to take with him to Meta, but did not identify them directly..Scale’s largest customer, Google, reportedly plans to cut ties with the AI data-labeling startup in the wake of the Meta deal. According to a report from Reuters, the tech giant has already held conversations with some of Scale’s rivals to shift much of the workload, representing a significant loss of business for the startup now valued at $29 billion. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment made by Fortune..Microsoft and Elon Musk’s xAI also reportedly looking to pull back from Scale after the high-profile deal, and despite Friar’s comments, OpenAI reportedly made a similar decision to pull back on some of its business with the startup several months ago.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-plans-continue-working-scale-112152230.html

These annotations, costing up to $100 each, are vital for generative AI developers..Scale also serves self-driving car companies and the US government, which are expected to remain clients..Meta’s stake has raised concerns among AI developers, who fear sharing proprietary data with Scale could expose their strategies to a rival, said Reuters..Scale’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, and select employees will transition to Meta, where Wang will lead AI efforts..The Meta deal will benefit Scale AI’s investors, including Accel and Index Ventures, and its employees..""Google to terminate Scale AI partnership"" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand... .The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Now options traders are signaling that they see the pricey cohort as especially vulnerable to another round of trade war-driven volatility..Most Read from Bloomberg.As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space.As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage.The cost of protecting against a correction in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, is climbing with less than a month to go until Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs potentially ends. On Friday, the relative price of hedging against a 10% decline in the ETF, compared with a similar rally, hit its highest level since early April..The growing skepticism toward the megacap rally shows investors are well aware of the risks, should trade tensions flare again and reignite worries around the US economic outlook. The tech behemoths fell harder than the broad market during the early April turmoil, and some investors see a threat that it could happen again..“Right now, high valuations, and to some extent economic impacts of the tariffs, are still worries,” Rocky Fishman, founder of research firm Asym 500, said in an interview..Helped by a positive earnings season, a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven — Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — has rallied 31% since April 8, the day before Trump paused most of his harshest tariffs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index is up 20%..Besides trade-war fears, there are other reasons for concern about the group, such as the amount of cash they’re throwing at artificial intelligence. That spending is fueling concerns about profit margins, and investors have high expectations that those expenditures will pay off..High valuations present another worry. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven gauge is trading at 29 times projected profits, above a 10-year average of 28. That compares with the S&P 500’s forward multiple of 22..Earlier this month, Needham analysts downgraded Apple’s stock to a hold rating, warning that the company’s valuation looks “expensive on several metrics.” They also cited the iPhone maker’s vulnerability to US tariffs..The uptick in demand for hedges underscores investor doubts about the staying power of the current rally, Fishman said..“With these reluctant rallies, where people don’t feel too excited and they just see the market keep on going up, then you start seeing investors getting nervous about giving up the gains they’ve picked up,” said Fishman.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-furious-rally-forces-093000399.html

The economy hasn't been impacted by tariffs so far, and demand for AI-related products hasn't slowed a bit. If you've got $1,000 to deploy, I think you will be incredibly happy with the price you've bought these stocks at three to five years down the road..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are at the top of my shopping list right now. Each of these investments brings something different to the table and creates a balanced approach to AI..Of these three, Nvidia represents the growth option. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the go-to computing device for nearly every AI hyperscaler. As a result, Nvidia's revenue boomed over the past few years and is still rapidly growing. In Q1 FY 2026 (ending April 28), its revenue rose 69% year over year to $44 billion, and revenue is projected to rise to $45 billion in Q2, indicating 50% growth. Although that's impressive, growth could be further bolstered by a trade deal with China that allows Nvidia to sell its chips there again or a significant AI buildout in Europe, which appears to be gaining steam recently..The stock isn't cheap at 33 times forward earnings, but that's the price you must pay to own a stock posting market-leading growth..We've only scratched the surface of the computing power necessary to run an economy assisted by AI, which will boost Nvidia's growth over the long run. There's still plenty of growth ahead for Nvidia, and the demand signals it's sending to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing back that up..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is a critical supplier to Nvidia, as Nvidia doesn't have the facilities to manufacture its own chips. So it outsources that work to a chip foundry like TSMC -- the world's top semiconductor foundry, boasting cutting-edge technology and best-in-class execution. Nearly all of the big tech companies are customers of TSMC in one way or another, and its neutral position in the chip world gives it a great view into the future, as chip orders are often placed years in advance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-buy-1-000-091500394.html

It now stands on the brink of a deal that would hand it stakes in major operations in Australia and Papua New Guinea — if it can secure regulatory approvals..Santos Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher has rebuffed several approaches from peers over the last few years, and has come under fire from impatient investors. Now the board of Australia’s second-largest fossil fuel producer has recommended Adnoc’s cash offer of $5.76 (A$8.89) per share — a 28% premium to Friday’s close..“Credit to Gallagher for extracting such a premium offer – he will have earned the payout of his ensuing incentives in doing so,” Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee, said in a note. “Gallagher has found his escape parachute and it’s made of gold.”.Santos shares closed 11% higher on Monday at A$7.72 a piece. That’s the biggest daily jump since November 2020, but the stock remains shy of the Adnoc offer, in large part because of the hurdles that lie ahead, including clearance from the Australian authority that reviews foreign investments..“It’s a great price,” Fereidun Fesharaki, founder and chairman of energy consulting group FGE told Bloomberg TV. “XRG is a global entity which wants to create a lot of LNG and upstream capability inside the company. My only question is whether Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board will accept this or not, and I think it will be challenging for them to approve it. In the past they have been very reluctant to make these approvals.”.Fesharaki added that one option would be to keep the current management and Santos as an independent player. “If you can convince them that this will function as an Australian company with foreign ownership, they might go along with it,” he added..A spokesman for the Treasury Department said in a statement that foreign investment matters are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure they aren’t contrary to national interest or security.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adnoc-makes-19-billion-takeover-015430686.html

Wars that we thought might end soon are flaring back up. Tariff-driven trade disputes have arisen. And on top of all that, inflation has continued to stick around, which has kept interest rates high. These factors have caused stocks to gyrate, making it tough to invest with much confidence. .Despite all this uncertainty, there are a few stocks I wouldn't hesitate to buy in the current environment.

From its ubiquitous Google search engine to its popular YouTube platform, cloud computing, and beyond, Alphabet has an expansive business..The tech titan generates massive revenues (over $90 billion in the first quarter) and prodigious profits (nearly $35 billion last quarter). It's growing quickly despite its enormous size (its revenue rose 12% last quarter, while its net income soared 46%). Its robust profitability enables it to invest heavily in expanding its business while returning boatloads of cash to shareholders..On the growth front, Alphabet is going all-in on artificial intelligence (AI). It rolled out Gemini 2.5 in the first quarter, its most intelligent AI model. The company is leveraging the power of AI to boost its Google search business through new features, such as AI overviews. It's also providing customers with AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. Meanwhile, it's returning more cash to investors by recently hiking its dividend by 5% and approving a new $70 billion share repurchase authorization..Despite its robust growth, Alphabet trades at a relatively attractive valuation these days. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 18.5 times, it trades at a discount to the broader market index.

When asked whether Trump or Xi would be a better partner for Australia, the two leaders were tied at 45% apiece..The results come as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attends a Group of Seven meeting in Canada, where he could hold his first face-to-face meeting with the US president.

Here’s what investors should watch out for next..Alphabet GOOGL GOOG said this week that it’s offering buyouts to many workers in a bid to cut costs amid economic and antitrust uncertainty, but it did not specify how many workers were impacted..This is a common move for companies, which may offer employees — particularly long-term, higher-paid workers — a buyout agreement to entice them to leave their jobs. To incentivize this, companies pay severance with the buyout package, among other benefits. Workers then have a choice: to accept or reject the offer..“A buyout is a voluntary exit option, has exit benefits and gives you some control over the decision,” Priya Rathod, a career expert at Indeed, told MarketWatch. “A layoff is an involuntary termination of employment. It’s often due to business reasons like downsizing or restructuring.”.On the surface, employee buyouts may be seen as preferable to layoffs because they allow workers to leave on their own terms, if they want to go. (You can turn down a buyout — more on that below.) But being presented with a buyout offer can be more complicated than that, especially if you suspect your company may follow a round of buyout offers by involuntarily eliminating jobs in the near future..Here’s what sets them apart, and how to decide whether accepting a buyout offer is a good deal for you or not..Workers who have received a buyout offer should carefully review the buyout’s terms before deciding whether to accept. And it’s not just about the money..“A good buyout includes generous severance pay, including the extension of benefits (healthcare and other coverage), possible bonuses, and often doesn’t hurt your unemployment benefits,” Rathod said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/company-offered-buyout-know-140000174.html

All it takes is a few decades of consistently adding relatively reasonable amounts of money to a diversified stock portfolio every month..If, for example, your portfolio's value is $50,000 today, and you add $200 a month to it steadily from here, it will be worth over $1 million in 30 years, assuming an average rate of return of 10% annually. And that's not an unreasonable assumption -- that's been the market's average annualized rate of return over the long haul..If you have savings sitting in your bank account earning close to zero in interest, perhaps this can be an inspiration to start up that investment account. The best time to begin was yesterday; the second best time to begin is now..But what stocks should you buy for your portfolio? To generate solid long-term returns, you cannot go wrong with some technology giants that are trading today at reasonable prices. Here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) can help lift your portfolio's value past the $1 million mark by the time you retire..Steady growth has been the name of the game at Amazon, and that has made it a monster stock to own over the last few decades. The company has a dominant position in e-commerce in the United States -- and a few other countries as well -- while simultaneously leading the global cloud computing market with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division..E-commerce still has plenty of market share it can steal from physical retail, even in Amazon's home country. E-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales in the United States sat at just 16.2% as of the first quarter of 2025. Despite Amazon's large presence and popularity, online shopping does not account for even $1 out of every $5 spent at retail. While e-commerce's share will not ever approach 100% due to items like fresh groceries -- although Amazon and others are working hard to deliver these, too -- e-commerce should become a much larger piece of the pie in the years to come..Amazon's North American retail sales grew by 8% year over year last quarter, while international sales grew 8% as well when factoring out foreign currency fluctuations.

He has also said that he won't invest in businesses that he understands. So, does that mean the legendary investor doesn't own any AI stocks? Nope..Actually, Buffett has invested roughly $90 billion in nine companies that are heavily focused on AI. Here they are -- and which one is the best of the bunch..Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker is valued at close to $59.3 billion. Although Buffett significantly reduced the conglomerate's position in Apple last year, it still makes up 21% of Berkshire's total portfolio..AI has been at the forefront of Apple's development strategy for years.

One market where much of the groundwork is being laid for long-term productivity gains from AI is cloud computing. The cloud market was valued at $348 billion, according to Synergy Research, and grew 23% year over year in the first quarter..Top cloud stocks are worth holding for the long term because of their investments in data centers, where companies store data to use with AI to gather insights, innovate, and build new products. Here are two cloud stocks trading at reasonable valuations that are poised for a bull run..Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock has tripled over the last three years, but it still offers upside. This leading cloud infrastructure provider just closed the books on fiscal 2025, where it posted better-than-expected revenue. The stock popped following the report and is closing in on a new all-time high..Oracle has gotten lost in the shadow of the leading hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. But Oracle's cloud revenue growth is about to accelerate significantly, which isn't reflected in the stock's valuation..In fiscal Q4, ended May 31, Oracle's total revenue grew 11% year over year, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle has been capitalizing on AI demand, with more than 100 cloud regions online. In March, management stated that it is becoming the preferred cloud choice for AI training and inferencing due to the superior performance and cost of its Gen 2 cloud architecture..Its growing data center presence, high-speed data transfer capabilities, and power capacity could give Oracle a major competitive advantage in the cloud infrastructure market. The acceleration in its cloud revenue last quarter suggests it could be entering a potent phase of high growth as AI workloads shift from training to inferencing for more sophisticated AI applications..Management's outlook calls for its total cloud revenue growth (applications plus infrastructure) to accelerate from 24% in fiscal 2025 to surpass 40% in fiscal 2026. This could pull Oracle's cloud growth well above AWS, which hasn't been able to crack the 20% growth level over the past year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-cloud-084500808.html

In my view, Oracle’s bold investments in Cloud services—particularly Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)—are clearly bearing fruit.

Total Cloud revenue—which includes both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)—jumped 27% year-over-year to roughly $6.7 billion. The real highlight was Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which surged 52% to reach $3 billion, underscoring Oracle’s aggressive push to capture AI-heavy workloads in the Cloud Infrastructure space..A key driver behind Oracle’s Cloud momentum is its smartly executed multi-cloud strategy. On the earnings call, Larry Ellison revealed that Oracle’s MultiCloud database services—used by customers on Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Google Cloud (GOOGL)—soared 115% quarter-over-quarter. This approach is savvy, as it turns would-be rivals into collaborators. With enterprise demand rising for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions, Oracle is carving out a distinct competitive edge among the major cloud providers..One of the key reasons I’m bullish on Oracle’s long-term growth is its record-high backlog of contracts, formally known as Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). This quarter, RPO surged 41% year-over-year to an all-time high of $138 billion. That’s a strong signal of sustained demand, providing a significant level of revenue visibility and stability for shareholders over the coming years..Management attributed much of this backlog growth to major contracts with companies like OpenAI, Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD). CEO Safra Catz expressed evident enthusiasm, projecting that Oracle’s Cloud business will grow by more than 40% in Fiscal 2026, with OCI continuing to expand at a rate above 70%. Oracle deserves real credit here—its momentum is undeniable, and Larry Ellison remains the quintessential relentless tech visionary, pushing the company to the forefront of the Cloud and AI revolution.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-orcl-delivers-strong-003100909.html
2025-06-15 06:00:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Are Still Growing Faster Than the Rest of the S&P 500. Here's When That Could Change, According to Wall Street Analysts.",The high valuations of most of the group could be a concern.,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" produced far better earnings growth than the rest of the market in the first quarter..Amazon and Alphabet were the biggest contributors to the outperformance..Investors will have to consider valuation as the rest of the market catches up with the Magnificent Seven..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has produced phenomenal returns over the last two and a half years since the bottom of the 2022 bear market. The index is up nearly 70% since Oct. 2022, but much of that gain has been driven by just a handful of stocks. The ""Magnificent Seven"" have, for the most part, outperformed the benchmark over that period, and there's a clear reason why..As a group, the Magnificent Seven have produced much better earnings growth than the rest of the S&P 500. Not only that, they've consistently beaten high earnings expectations. That trend continued in the first quarter, but analysts are starting to think their phenomenal run of outperforming everything else in the market may come to an end soon..Here's what investors need to know..After Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released its quarterly earnings on May 28, FactSet reported the Magnificent Seven grew earnings 27.7% in aggregate. That massively outperformed analysts' expectations of 16.0% earnings growth for the group. Here's how it breaks down:.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.59 earnings per share (EPS) vs. $1.36 expected, up 62% year over year..Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL): $2.81 EPS vs. $2.01 expected, up 49% year over year..Meta Platforms: $6.43 EPS vs. $5.22 expected, up 37% year over year..Nvidia: $0.81 EPS vs. $0.75 expected, up 33% year over year..Microsoft: $3.46 EPS vs. $3.22 expected, up 18% year over year..Apple: $1.65 EPS vs. $1.62 expected, up 8% year over year..Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): $0.27 EPS vs. $0.41 expected, down 40% year over year..Six out of the seven outperformed expectations, and five of them grew earnings faster than the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 (9.4%). But as you can see, the level of outperformance and year-over-year growth varies widely from company to company..The weakest showing was most obviously from Tesla, which has suffered from political backlash against CEO Elon Musk, combined with rising competition from Chinese automaker BYD. As a result, deliveries dropped 13% year over year in the first quarter while average selling price also declined. The company's ramp-up in AI spending to support its forthcoming autonomous vehicle efforts also weighed on earnings results.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-still-growing-faster-220000180.html

Unlike many of his peers on Wall Street, Ackman primarily keeps a tightly concentrated portfolio, with Pershing Square owning only about 10 stocks at any given time..For the last couple of years, Pershing Square's most direct artificial intelligence (AI) investment has been a sizable position in Alphabet. Ackman has made it clear that its diversified ecosystem -- spanning internet search, cloud computing, advertising, cybersecurity, and more -- combined with an attractive valuation is what enticed Pershing Square to take a position in the ""Magnificent Seven"" member..Well, just a few weeks ago, news broke that Pershing Square had recently initiated a position in another AI stock, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Ackman now joins Warren Buffett, whom he is known to admire, and Cathie Wood as prominent personalities on Wall Street who have exposure to Amazon, through their respective portfolios at Berkshire Hathaway and ARK Invest..Let's explore what makes Amazon such a compelling AI stock for the long haul. I'll break down some trends in the business and the company's valuation to help explain why Amazon has earned the approval of Ackman, Buffett, and Wood..Given how hot AI has become, investors may be challenged to identify which opportunities are best suited for long-term positions. What I mean by that is while semiconductor stocks or AI software businesses have risen in popularity over the last couple of years, it's hard to know which of these companies will continue to be a market leader in 10 years (or longer)..To me, Amazon is like the business version of a Swiss Army knife. The company's core segments are e-commerce and cloud computing infrastructure via Amazon Web Services (AWS)..But it also has a thriving advertising business and a growing subscription service (Amazon Prime), and it has even made some progress in the streaming and entertainment landscape..Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is uniquely positioned to stitch its various operating units together through more AI-powered services. In essence, by leveraging the power of AI, it can bolster both the consumer and enterprise sides of its business and make the platform increasingly sticky for its customers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-bill-ackman-just-joined-200900330.html

These three options meet the mark, though.","Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have led the S&P 500 higher over the last two and a half years..These three stocks trade at relatively low valuations compared to other high-flying AI stocks..They each have meaningful upside across the board, from AI software to hardware to chip manufacturing..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most-talked-about topics on Wall Street over the last two and a half years. More than 40% of S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) companies have cited ""AI"" on their earnings calls for five straight quarters, according to FactSet Insight. Practically every business is looking at how the recent innovations and influx of spending on AI can impact just about every aspect of their business..But while AI is providing a ton of growth for some, it can be a cost center without a clear payoff for others. However, even if a company falls into the former camp, investors should be wary about overpaying for growth that could slow down as the business scales..Finding good value in AI stocks isn't easy. And if you have a limited investment budget, like $200, you'll want to make sure you're only buying the best available options..These three companies all have stocks that trade for less than $200 per share and offer excellent value for the growth potential ahead of them. All three are benefiting from the growth of AI and should play important roles in the future development of artificial intelligence and computing from here..Many investors are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence on Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) core Google Search product. Apple's Eddy Cue testified that search queries were down on its Safari browser during the month of April for the first time in 22 years, supporting the idea that AI services like ChatGPT are eating into its market share..But a decline in searches on a single browser, while surprising, isn't too concerning. AI is a bigger boost to Alphabet than a challenge. It's seen great success with its AI Overviews in search queries, which management says increase engagement while monetizing at the same level as traditional search results. It's also leveraged AI to offer new features like circle-to-search and Google Lens, which overindex toward valuable product searches..Artificial intelligence has been a massive driver of growth for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. It saw revenue climb 28% in the first quarter, with its operating margin expanding from 9.4% to 17.8%. Management said it remains supply-constrained, so strong revenue growth should continue. On top of that, Google's bigger cloud computing competitors sport even higher operating margins, so there's room to expand profits as it scales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-095500655.html

And if such a company pays a rising dividend that can grow over time, that's a big future passive income opportunity..Currently, skepticism abounds for the following three S&P 500 dividend stocks. But scooping up shares today could pay big dividends -- pun intended -- over the long run..The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are generally some of the strongest, most resilient, and innovative companies around, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is by far the cheapest of the bunch. Shares trade at just around 20 times earnings, not only a discount to peers but even the overall market..And while its dividend is only 0.5%, Alphabet's payout ratio is just 8.9%, leaving huge room for growth. Instead of a bigger dividend, Alphabet is returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases, while also investing in future AI growth..Of course, the reason Alphabet's stock has been under pressure is due to concerns over its main cash cow, Google Search, and the threat posed by AI chatbots..While that is something to monitor, Alphabet has been innovating in AI rapidly, delivering ""AI Overviews"" when users search a topic, which management claims monetizes at the same rate as Search. The company also unveiled ""AI Mode"" in Google Search on May 20, offering the experience of a chatbot within the Search ecosystem..Furthermore, Alphabet has been rapidly catching up to AI chatbot leader OpenAI in large language models (LLMs). When Alphabet's Gemini 2.5 LLM was released on March 25, it immediately rocketed up the developer rankings among top-performing LLMs, seizing the current lead for many applications..Given Alphabet's technical talent and financial resources, I'd expect the company to muddle through this transition. But even if Search growth slows down, there are other AI-related growth opportunities related to Gemini-powered chatbots and agents..Meanwhile, Alphabet has three other large and growing businesses the market appears to be ignoring: YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. YouTube is the the largest streaming company in the world, and growing by double-digits. Google Cloud, while the third-place infrastructure platform, still grew 28% last quarter to a $50 billion annual revenue run-rate, and has been profitable since the first quarter of 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-p-500-dividend-083000955.html

Broadcom has big opportunities in networking, custom AI chips, and virtualization.","Nvidia is the king of AI accelerator chips, but some smaller AI players may have more upside..AMD has a big opportunity as the AI inference market grows..Broadcom has big opportunities in networking, custom AI chips, and virtualization..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Up by about 26,000% over the past decade (as of this writing), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a monster stock for investors. Its market capitalization has grown to about $3.5 trillion, making it one of the two most valuable companies in the world, neck-and-neck with Microsoft..The stock's performance, meanwhile, has been well justified. The company's sales and earnings have grown explosively over that decade -- and particularly in the past few years as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure build-out. The company's ongoing spectacular growth could be seen in its fiscal Q1 results: The $39.1 billion in data center revenue it booked was more than 9 times the $4.3 billion in data center revenue it generated in its Q1 just two years prior..Make no mistake, Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies to continue to benefit from the ongoing AI boom. However, the company is now massive, and as the base used to measure its growth gets bigger, the percentage gains are likely to get smaller because comparisons will get tougher. Investors shouldn't be surprised if percentage growth rates decline..For investors looking to diversify their AI infrastructure exposure or find investments with potentially more upside than Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are two strong alternatives. Here's why..While Nvidia's GPUs dominate the market for AI training chips, AMD has carved out a niche in AI inference, which is expected to become the much larger market over time. Nvidia's CUDA platform gives it a clear edge in AI model training, thanks to its broad hardware support, strong documentation, developer loyalty, and a deep library of AI tools that are already built and optimized to boost its GPU performance. However, once models are trained, running them (inference) is more about cost, latency, and efficiency..AMD's ROCm software has steadily improved, and while it still lags far behind CUDA for training, it's generally considered good enough for running inference workloads. That's important because inference demand is starting to accelerate, and cost-effectiveness plays a much bigger role in chip selection.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-buy-2-artificial-082000561.html

Pure-play quantum computing companies face financial challenges that could easily diminish their ability to drive long-term returns.  This tech giant can likely invest whatever is necessary to succeed in quantum computing.","This company is not a quantum computing pure play, but has invested in refining the technology..Pure-play quantum computing companies face financial challenges that could easily diminish their ability to drive long-term returns..This tech giant can likely invest whatever is necessary to succeed in quantum computing..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Investing in quantum computing has brought some unusual challenges. Its quantum bits, called qubits, can store any value between zero and one. This factor makes quantum computers exponentially faster than traditional computers, whose bits can only store zeroes and ones..However, quantum computing is also a solution without a problem to solve, dramatically limiting its addressable market. With most companies in this industry unable to generate sufficient revenues, many quantum computing stocks have struggled to maintain their stock gains. But amid market conditions, one specific quantum stock could prosper during the remainder of 2025..Amid the current state of the market, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) should appear attractive to investors..Admittedly, this may appear to be a baffling choice at first glance. The company generated more than $90 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, with over 99% of that revenue coming from its digital advertising businesses and Google Cloud. Seeing those numbers arguably raises the question of why one should consider Alphabet a quantum computing investment when the technology has no representation in the company's financial statements..However, such a strategy makes more sense when considering the state of pure-play quantum computing companies. Without an apparent addressable market, such companies depend on government contracts that fall far short of covering the company's operating expenses..The financials of these companies outline the struggle. In the first quarter, IonQ reported $7.5 million in revenue, a small fraction of its $83.2 million in costs and expenses. Even with $38.5 million in gains on the fair value of warrant liabilities, it still lost $38.3 million..Rigetti Computing reported a similar story, with revenue of $1.5 million falling far short of the $22.1 million in operating expenses. Interestingly, a $53.3 million change in the fair value of derivative warrant liabilities helped it earn $42.6 million in net income for the quarter..Still, investors cannot depend on one-time benefits for long-term profitability, and with operating expenses far exceeding revenue for both companies, such pure-play quantum computing companies look like less attractive options.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-quantum-computing-stock-surge-072500394.html

This is how we interact with people..“But when you used a computer back then, you select from a menu, click a button or you guess keywords and browse links that come back from the keyword search. So we were tackling the problem of how to use language to interact with machines, which of course is incredibly topical now because large language models (LLMs) have essentially cracked that.

It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI..Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition..The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors' access to Scale's services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals' operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet's Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta's stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back..In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data.

The company declined to comment on specifics with Google..Scale AI raked in $870 million in revenue in 2024, and Google spent some $150 million on Scale AI's services last year, sources said..Other major tech companies that are customers of Scale's, including Microsoft, are also backing away. Elon Musk's xAI is also looking to exit, one of the sources said.

This in-house platform features a more powerful computing system than that used in Rivian's earlier vehicles and is tailored specifically for its current and future models.RAP provides Level 2+ autonomy, meaning it supports the driver with alerts and interventions, such as steering corrections and emergency braking, but it never takes full control of the vehicle. The system includes a comprehensive set of ADAS tools, stepping in only when necessary.Standard on the R1T and R1S models, RAP’s features fall into two main categories: Driving Assist and Active Safety Assist. Driving Assist includes user-activated tools like Highway Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane-Change Assistance. Active Safety Assist includes automatic features aimed at preventing accidents, such as lane safety, lighting adjustments, parking and reversing aids, and collision mitigation. RIVN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the introduction of its second-generation R1 platform, Rivian has significantly upgraded RAP. The vehicles now use a revamped perception system and computing setup, including 55-megapixel cameras and onboard processing power exceeding 200 trillion operations per second. The platform’s AI-driven design and vertically integrated hardware allow Rivian to efficiently collect and process high-quality, multi-modal sensor data, giving it a competitive edge in ADAS development. Other automakers like Toyota Motor Corporation TM and Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, and Tesla TSLA are also making progress on the development of their respective autonomous vehicle platforms.In April, Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo reached a preliminary agreement to explore a collaboration focused on the development of a new autonomous vehicle platform.

QBTS has emerged as one of the most compelling stories in the high-tech investment landscape, driven by a massive surge of 1,343.6% over the past year, far outpacing the industry and benchmarks. This growth underscores growing investor confidence in the company's quantum annealing technology..While giants like International Business Machines IBM and Alphabet GOOGL dominate headlines with their gate-based quantum systems, D-Wave has introduced a commercially focused path through quantum annealing, solving complex optimization problems in minutes. This alternative approach of D-Wave is rapidly expanding into commercial use cases in logistics, finance and manufacturing, where it delivers tangible business outcomes today..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.D-Wave stands out as a long-term investment by solving real-world problems today, unlike its rivals, which are focused on future gate-model systems. Its annealing-based Advantage2 prototype has already demonstrated quantum advantage, completing tasks in minutes that would take classical supercomputers millennia. With its Leap cloud platform and active deployments at companies like Ford Otosan and NTT DOCOMO, D-Wave is generating real commercial value. As demand for optimization and AI accelerates, its proven technology and enterprise traction give it strong staying power in the quantum space..IBM: On June 10, 2025, IBM revealed its plan for Quantum Starling, its first fault-tolerant quantum computer, set to be launched by 2029. Designed to run 20,000× more operations than current systems, Starling will use around 200 logical qubits with advanced error correction and real-time oversight. This marks a major step from theory to practical, large-scale quantum computing..Alphabet: In December 2024, Google unveiled Willow, a 105-qubit processor that marked a major step forward in quantum error correction. Tests showed that adding more qubits significantly reduced error rates, achieving a key milestone known as “below-threshold” scaling. Willow also completed a complex task in under five minutes that would take classical supercomputers trillions of years.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +7.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

2025-06-13 21:00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is a Trending Stock,"Alphabet (GOOG) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +12.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.3%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.16 indicates a change of +6.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Should you get in while the price is less than $5 per digital coin?,"Polkadot is aiming to power the next generation of Web3 applications..The JAM upgrade will make Polkadot more flexible and developer-friendly, paving the way toward full-fledged Web3 apps and services..Web3 could disrupt giants like Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Netflix in the future..10 stocks we like better than Polkadot ›.The Polkadot (CRYPTO: DOT) cryptocurrency is going through some pretty exciting changes these days. The Web3 Foundation's official crypto coin is becoming a distributed supercomputer, ready to provide a wide variety of apps and services. Yet, the coin price keeps falling..Should you pick up a few Polkadot coins while they're available for less than $5 apiece? I think that's a good idea, and here's why..First things first. Polkadot was designed to support a Web3 future. The social networks and paywalls of the Web2 world were unstoppable over the last 20 years. These days, a lot of web users are getting tired of this aging structure, looking around for new ideas. The Web3 idea is one alternative, bringing more personal freedom and giving content creators more control over their creations. In this system, gigantic hubs of advertising and social media connections are replaced by decentralized services. And Polkadot's app-building ecosystem provides a handy platform to get all the Web3 ideas done in the real world..It's still a futuristic ideology with just a handful of early success stories. But in the long run, Web3 apps could take over your online community connections, your day-to-day financial management processes, and your favorite channels for text, video, and audio infotainment. The tools won't even run in the centrally managed cloud you know and love today, but in a new global network of blockchain-based systems. When tweaked just right, the crypto world's smart contracts can run any kind of program and perform all sorts of services. And that's what Polkadot is doing, with the help of many other cryptocurrency systems..So far, Polkadot is mostly known for its ability to interact with other blockchain networks. This coin's smart contracts can tap into Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) monetary value storage, Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) sophisticated contracts, and Chainlink's (CRYPTO: LINK) real-world data reports, just to name a few..It's also known as a complicated and cumbersome system, but that's changing in 2025. Polkadot's central blockchain will soon be replaced by a more flexible and standards-based system known as JAM (the Joint-Accumulate Machine, if you're curious). This is actually a virtual machine in the blockchain universe. It can compile and run any code for bog-standard central processors, because it's a software-driven and full-featured RISC-V processor.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-polkadot-while-under-5-112300879.html

Out of the 300 quantum computing patents issued in 2025, two companies have received the most..What Happened: International Business Machines Corp. and Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google appear to have made significant investments in the quantum computing space on a year-to-date basis..According to the data shared by Martin Shkreli, there was a steep drop-off in issued patents after IBM and Google, suggesting that other companies are either smaller players or not prioritizing quantum computing as heavily..IonQ Inc., D-Wave Quantum Inc., PsiQuantum, Quantinuum, and Intel Corp., followed the first two firms..Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share...Furthermore, he highlighted that Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) also hold quantum patents, which he describes as “big company spend.”.Large corporations often invest in emerging technologies like quantum computing to hedge against future disruptions, even if they're not leading the field..Shkreli also notes that companies like Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) are working on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and quantum networking patents. QKD uses quantum mechanics to secure communications, offering theoretically unbreakable encryption..Lastly, Shkreli suggests that Microsoft Corp.’s patent output doesn't match its spending or public statements, implying they may be focusing more on development or partnerships rather than patenting their work...See Also: Invest where it hurts — and help millions heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold..Why It Matters: The evolving quantum computing space relies on qubits, which, unlike classical bits in traditional computers, can superpose and entangle 0 and 1 to solve complex problems.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-google-emerge-top-investors-104611410.html
2025-06-13 18:00:00,The 2025 stock market rally is about more than just the 'Magnificent 7': Morning Brief,"After two years of few S&P 500 companies outperforming the index,  market participation is broadening in 2025.","This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:.The chart of the day.What we're watching.What we're reading.Economic data releases and earnings.Nearly halfway through 2025, it's clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice..In 2023 and 2024, investors championed the rise of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history..Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&P 500's 2.6% gain..Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means ""the health of the broader economy is improving."".Across the S&P 500's 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU)..The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have contributed significantly to the market's most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard..Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro notes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 5.32%..As we highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord — rather than in a large group depending on the president's Truth Social posts — as peak tariff uncertainty subsides..AI remains a key theme for investors in that environment, but not all of this year's biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past..AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year's biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG)..And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2025-stock-market-rally-is-about-more-than-just-the-magnificent-7-morning-brief-100042029.html

As a result, eight of the world's 10 most valuable public companies are now tech companies..Admittedly, 2025 has gotten off to a rough start to 2025 for many of these top companies. Yet it's not time to panic. If anything, this is a time to scoop up some great companies that are trading at relative discounts..If you're looking to add tech stocks to your portfolio, consider the following two companies. They're in good positions to return great long-term value..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), also referred to as TSMC, is one of the world's most important tech companies. It's the world's largest semiconductor foundry, with a market share in contract chipmaking space of around 67%..For perspective, the second-largest semiconductor foundry is Samsung, which has a roughly 7% market share..Instead of designing and producing its own semiconductors for general sale, TSMC manufactures chips on behalf of other companies. They come to TSMC with the designs, and it uses its top-of-the-line manufacturing facilities to bring those products to life. Its success with this model has made TSMC the go-to chip fabricator for well-known companies like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and dozens of others..These high-dollar clients have treated TSMC well, too. In the first quarter, TSMC's revenue increased 35% year over year to $25.5 billion, and its cash from operations increased 43%. Both gains were continuations of impressive runs over the past five years..The next few years should be lucrative: Management estimates that TSMC's revenue will grow at a compound annual rate of 20% from 2024 to 2029. If that forecast proves accurate, TSMC will be bringing in well over $200 billion by 2029..Much of this optimism stems from the surging demand for AI-capable semiconductors as the broader AI boom continues. TSMC's high-performance computing (HPC) segment, which contains its AI-related semiconductors, accounted for 59% of the company's revenue in Q1. In Q1 2024, it was only 46%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-tech-stocks-buy-093600099.html
2025-06-13 17:30:00,Better Quantum Computing Stock: Rigetti Computing or IonQ?,"Both companies have adequate cash levels to fund current operations.  Quantum computing stocks are still quite hot in the market, although their week-to-week performance can be incredibly volatile.  For example, one of the more popular quantum computing plays, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI), set a new all-time high right at the end of 2024, but plunged 70% just a few weeks into 2025.","Rigetti Computing and IonQ use different approaches to quantum computing..Both companies have adequate cash levels to fund current operations..10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›.Quantum computing stocks are still quite hot in the market, although their week-to-week performance can be incredibly volatile. For example, one of the more popular quantum computing plays, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI), set a new all-time high right at the end of 2024, but plunged 70% just a few weeks into 2025. Now, it's only off around 40% from its all-time high. One of its peers, IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), has also seen extreme volatility, although not quite the same level as Rigetti..Of these two, is one a more attractive stock to buy? Although quantum computing is still a few years away from being widely used commercially, any quantum company could have a breakthrough at a moment's notice, and send shares soaring. That alone is enough to get some investors excited about the stocks, but I think there's one pick that might prevail in this analysis..Both IonQ and Rigetti are quantum computing start-ups that rely on external funding to continue their operations. Both companies have issued more shares, taken on debt, and received contracts for their work. Basically, any funding source that's outside of actual profitability. Until these companies can prove quantum computing's relevance to everyday problems, they will be in this external funding state, which makes examining cash piles and resource burn critical..Free cash flow (FCF) is an excellent measure of understanding how much cash is burning each quarter, as it utilizes operating cash flow and subtracts capital expenditures from that figure as well. For unprofitable companies like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, this allows investors to understand how long their current cash pile would last if operations continued in their present state..IonQ has around 16 quarters of cash left, and Rigetti has about 13 quarters left. However, Rigetti Computing is also undergoing a capital raise, as it is issuing enough stock to generate $350 million in additional funds for the company. This will ensure the company's finances and allow it to invest more aggressively in its quantum computing capabilities..Both companies believe that 2030 will be a turning point for quantum computing. IonQ believes it will be profitable by then, and Rigetti points out that the quantum computing market will dramatically expand in the decade following 2030.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-quantum-computing-stock-rigetti-093000313.html

Meanwhile, betting site Polymarket lists only a 30% chance that Tesla (TSLA) launches the service before July, highlighting Musk's rosy predictions on self-driving that have been constantly pushed back..While Tesla is on the verge of starting a new chapter for the company, Alphabet’s (GOOG) Waymo has been quietly racking up mile after mile, trip after trip, providing actual paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin — where Tesla’s test will begin..At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently, but could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver..Waymo has an early lead, and it seems a big one. Rivals like Argo AI and GM-backed Cruise are gone, leaving only smaller players like Zoox (backed by Amazon), China’s Pony AI (PONY), and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla..Waymo (before it was even called that) started off as an in-house startup as part of Google’s X initiative way back in 2009..After some testing and securing of permits, the project officially became Waymo in 2016, and it started testing its Pacifica hybrid vans kitted out with cameras, LIDAR laser sensors, and radar..In 2018 Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker’s I-Pace EV for its testing; these are the vehicles most users are accustomed to seeing..Waymo's combination of vision, radar, and LIDAR, which the company calls its “multimodal” approach, has the company claiming it has the best and safest robotaxi solution..Since 2020, anyone in a service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that the company performs around 250,000 trips a week..A Waymo spokesperson said that the company has not yet seen a vision-only system that can achieve the levels of safety its current system has achieved, asserting that multiple sensors with overlapping fields of view are the best solution..Experts tend to agree..“Waymo is undoubtedly the leader in autonomous driving technology, with their self-driving software (SDS) being widely regarded as best in class,” said University of San Francisco engineering professor William Riggs, an expert in autonomous technology. “They have been around the longest, had patient capital, and have the most miles on the road proving that self-driving tech works.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-waymo-got-the-edge-on-the-competition-and-teslas-robotaxi-so-far-090019552.html

With the technology perhaps being a once-in-a-generation opportunity, it's not too late to invest in the stocks leading the AI charge..Let's look at five leading AI stocks to buy right now..Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling growth stories in AI by helping organizations actually put AI to work..By gathering data and structuring it into an ""ontology,"" Palantir's AI platform (AIP) maps digital assets to real-world objects and processes to let customers apply AI to solve real-world problems. AIP is being used for a variety of tasks, from optimizing supply chains to automating underwriting to even monitoring for sepsis in hospitals..While the company has long been an important government vendor, Palantir's growth is currently being powered by the U.S. public sector. Given the wide array of applications across industries that AIP can be used for, Palantir has a massive opportunity in front of it..Recently, Palantir has introduced AI agents within AIP that go beyond analysis to take action. Agentic AI is becoming the next big AI push, and could be a big growth driver for the company..That said, the stock isn't cheap, and government budget cuts could potentially impact growth. Still, Palantir's technology looks unmatched, and the company is well-positioned to be a long-term AI leader..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to be one of the top ways to invest in the AI infrastructure boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of AI data centers thanks to their powerful parallel processing capabilities. And as the engine that helps run AI workloads, demand for GPUs continues to soar as organizations race to build and run AI models and apps..Nvidia's real moat, however, comes from its CUDA software platform, which it created to make it easier for developers to program its chips. Since then, it has built a powerful suite of tools and libraries that further enhance its GPUs' performance for AI workloads..The tight integration between its powerful GPUs and CUDA helped Nvidia attain an over 90% share in the GPU market in Q1. Its new Blackwell chips are ramping up faster than any product in its history, and demand for its full-stack AI ""factories"" continues to surge.

In addition to supplying its powerful chips to data centers, the company has adapted its graphics processing unit (GPU) technology for other markets, including automotive, gaming, and professional graphics..The data center market is the company's largest growth driver right now. Last quarter, its sales to data centers grew 73% year over year to $39 billion, accounting for 88% of its total business. Analysts expect surging demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chips to boost its full-year revenue to $200 billion..With data center operators and hyperscalers expected to spend $1 trillion annually on infrastructure by 2029, according to Dell'Oro Group, Nvidia's revenue could grow quite substantially from there. It has been investing in GPU innovation for decades, and as a result, controls the lion's share of the market. In the desktop GPU market alone, its share is estimated to be 92%..The demand for more advanced AI computing systems isn't slowing down. Nvidia is working with companies worldwide to build AI factories -- new types of data centers designed specifically for AI workloads. Nvidia reported seeing an accelerating deployment of these AI-optimized data centers last quarter..Nvidia is also positioned to help companies build world-changing products like humanoid robots with its Isaac GR00T N1 robot development platform. In the view of CEO Jensen Huang, general-use robots could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Nvidia could also benefit from the growth of autonomous vehicles thanks to its DRIVE computing platform. Its automotive revenue grew 72% year over year last quarter to $567 million..The stock trades at 33 times forward earnings estimates.

According to the firm, the “latest data show GOOGL’s leadership is stable to improving.”.“GOOGL’s leading position (‘first place to go’) remains largely intact across ecommerce, travel, autos, financials and healthcare.”.On the same day, Google also added a chief AI architect to its leadership ranks. The company continues to prioritize artificial intelligence, adding the technology to more of its products. The company has confirmed that Koray Kavukcuoglu, Google DeepMind’s chief technology officer, has been chosen for the new senior vice president position. Kavukcuoglu will be reporting directly to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, helping with product strategy and accelerating “how we bring our world-leading models into our products, with the goal of more seamless integration, faster iteration, and greater efficiency.”.Photo by Kai Wenzel on Unsplash Kavukcuoglu’s appointment as chief AI architect follows pressures that the company has been facing to create money-making products from its flagship AI technology. AI competition is getting fiercer each passing day. However, tech companies are finding it hard to show significant returns. Analysts on Wall Street currently have a consensus “Buy” rating on the stock. The average price target of $200 implies a 13% upside; however, the Street-high target of $250 implies an upside of 41%. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.  Meta announced what it called a “strategic partnership and investment” with Scale late Thursday.,"Meta (META) is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale (SCAI.PVT) and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing “superintelligence” at the tech giant..The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)..Meta announced what it called a “strategic partnership and investment” with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion..Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will “substantially expand Scale and Meta’s commercial relationship.” Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup..Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale’s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company’s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats (UBER) and Axon..Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of “superintelligence” — which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI — is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology..It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft (MSFT) hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division..Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon (AMZN) made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept’s AI systems and datasets..Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016..They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier..Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM, 7203.T) have been among Scale's customers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-invests-ai-firm-scale-014012442.html

The size of the investment was $14.3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. The deal values the startup at more than $29 billion, including the money raised, Scale said in a blog post Thursday..As part of the investment, Scale CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang is set to take on a new role at Meta on its AI team. Wang will join the company’s “superintelligence” unit, focused on building AI that performs as well as humans, a hypothetical advance often referred to as artificial general intelligence. Wang will stay on at Scale as a board member..“Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI,” a Meta spokesperson said. “As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models.”.Meta will take a 49% stake in the company, said the person familiar, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Meta is purchasing nonvoting shares. Bloomberg News previously reported Meta was in talks with Scale..In a statement on Thursday, Wang said that the investment “recognizes Scale’s accomplishments” and underscores the importance of AI technology. “AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time, with unlimited possibility and far-reaching influence on how people, businesses and governments succeed,” he said..Scale’s new interim CEO will be Jason Droege. In a statement, the company said that even after its Meta partnership, “Scale remains an independent leader in AI, committed to providing industry-leading AI solutions and safeguarding customer data.”.Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, has made AI the top focus at his social networking company this year, earmarking tens of billions of dollars for AI-related infrastructure and hiring.

The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries..Apple’s “.4” updates — known as “E” on the company’s internal software development schedule — are typically released in March. That was the case with iOS 18.4 this year and iOS 17.4 in 2024. But an exact date hasn’t been set internally for the software, beyond a spring time frame, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is private..Apple, in response to a request for comment, said it hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features. It reiterated earlier statements that the upgrades are planned for the “coming year.”.The timeline could still shift depending on whether new snags emerge. If the next several weeks of development work proves promising, the company could consider giving a preview of the features when it launches the next iPhones in the fall, one of the people said, though no final decisions have been made..The upgrade has been a long time coming. Apple originally introduced the next-generation Siri features at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June of last year. The idea was to modernize the voice assistant — first introduced in 2011 — which hasn’t kept pace with chatbots and other AI tools..The technology in the works also includes a system called App Intents that allows Siri to more precisely control applications and in-app actions across Apple devices..If the latest release timing sticks, Apple will have gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers. It’s been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year — despite the new Siri not being close to ready..Internally, Apple’s AI and marketing teams have pointed fingers at each other. The engineering side has blamed marketing for overhyping features, while marketing maintains it operated on timelines provided to them by the company’s AI teams, according to people with knowledge of the matter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-targets-spring-2026-release-204531105.html

And as a result, Nvidia stock has gone supernova, up nearly 950% since November ‘22..For a while, it looked to own the keys to the entire AI kingdom..InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips.But what if I told you there’s another chip quietly emerging from the shadows?.It’s one that most investors haven’t yet heard of; and that Nvidia doesn’t specialize in….A chip that, thanks to a seismic shift in how AI works – from Nvidia-dominated GPU training to inference and deployment at scale – could soon become the hottest chip on the market….A Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU..A TPU is a custom-built chip that Google designed specifically for running AI models..Unlike Nvidia’s GPUs, which were originally built for rendering video game graphics and later repurposed for AI, TPUs were born with one job: execute computations at blistering speed and maximum efficiency..In essence, you can think of GPUs as general-purpose race cars and TPUs as hyper-optimized rockets..And while GPUs are best at training AI models, TPUs were made to dominate inferencing: the part where AI actually thinks, reasons, and responds to users in real time..That’s where AI models are going – and why TPUs could start to steal the show in a big way..In some ways, creating genius-level AI is a lot like raising a child..You teach them everything they need to know, with books, flashcards, lectures, and thousands of examples. It takes time. It’s expensive. And for machines, it’s computationally brutal..When they achieve inference, they can actually answer questions, solve problems, write custom pieces, or create unique visual art..Historically, the AI race has been all about training; and Nvidia GPUs became the workhorses of that race..But once the model is trained, inference is forever. The AI runs billions of times to serve billions of people..That’s where the money – and the demand for computational power – starts compounding..Remember the DeepSeek saga that unfolded earlier this year?.Back before the trade war started (which seems like forever ago, I know), a Chinese AI lab named DeepSeek dropped a bomb on the industry..It had trained a GPT-4-class model for just $6 million… a fraction of the $100 million-plus price tags seen in Western AI labs. But that wasn’t the headline. The real innovation was architectural: DeepSeek built its model to do less thinking upfront and more thinking on the fly using inference.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-tpu-powering-very-future-161406079.html

Nvidia trading near record highs as tech per usual big driver of the market's push higher. The tech sector, is it poised to remain the market leader? That's the big question. Our very own Josh Schafer joins us now at the desk. You've been digging into this and this leadership that we've seen from tech in this rally. .Yeah, Brad, so I mean, you have the S&P 500 back near record highs, of course, Nvidia also back near record highs, as you mentioned, right? And so the question I've sort of been posing the strategist over the last week is, okay, well, if we go higher, what takes us higher, right? What's sort of this next leg of the bull market? And I think it's interesting because you sort of hear both sides of this trade, right? Like the folks over at City, they just moved up their S&P 500 target to 6300. They're still talking about growth is defensive. You think about a lot of these companies, Nvidia would probably be included in that, maybe an Apple, all really all of them, right? Are cash rich businesses, they're businesses that can do well if rates stay higher. But what I thought was interesting, different take from Richard Bernstein over at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He had a note out calling it the mid seven. .Mhm. .And so when I talked to Richard, he highlighted this chart. Uh this is the percent of stocks that have outperformed the S&P 500. Of course, those two little lines you see over the last two years are 2023 and 2024, right? That was your mag seven led rally. Well, pick your head up. Stocks outside of the mag seven have been doing very well thus far in 2025, right? You've seen a lot of outperformance from a lot of the other sectors. I think seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are outperforming the index. And so Bernstein sort of making the point that as growth slows for that mag seven cohort. Yes, the earnings year of year growth is still strong, but it is slowing, right? That rate of change is coming down. That might make the case for perhaps some more of the 493 and some other areas of the market to be areas where you can you can play. .I I just didn't expect from mid seven the Gen Z vernacular to make its way into a Richard Bernstein analysis here. It's mid right now. .It's mid. Sometimes it's just mid, Brad. .You know, as we talk about that leadership, Adil, what are you anticipating from the mag seven, especially as we're looking for this diversification within portfolios right now? .Yeah, so we we do think that these companies will continue to do well because what happens is that there's a lot of expenditure that is going into artificial intelligence. There's a lot of government policy that is supporting artificial. There's deregulation also happening. And that makes us believe that because of the productivity that these companies are bringing about because of AI related productivity, that's going to cause GDP to increase as well. So we do think that the mag seven will continue to do well, but one of the problems we see, we deal with a lot of retail investors. One of the problems we see is that people are like overly concentrated in the mag seven. You know, like they'll have 60 to 70% of their portfolio in tech related investments. That's where we want to put the personal finance hat on, and we want to say that this can be treacherous. Make sure you're broad because to your point, there are a lot of other sectors that are doing really well. AI doesn't mean that only mag seven will do well. There are other sectors that could do well also. .Has that rebalancing started to happen among clients yet? Because I feel like April was maybe a wake up or February to April was a little bit of a wake up call, right? Those a lot of those stocks got hammered pretty significantly, but then you had the strong come up really over the last month and a half now. Are clients starting to really wonder like, okay, should I rebalance here? Did I just hold Nvidia? Did really well, and now it's too big in the portfolio? .Well, there's this is where the behavioral finance comes in as well because, you know, people don't want to sell Nvidia like they love it, right? So and we've been where others were being aggressive end of last year, we were being defensive. We were saying all right, you know, take a pause, take a step back, right size your exposure to these companies, increase the breadth of your portfolio. So we have been doing it, but I do feel that the ordinary retail investor that is having a do it yourself approach is overexposed there. Uh if you look at the S&P 500 by itself, that's more than 40% in tech right now. And if you add a few other technology companies in the portfolio, now you're 50, 60% in tech, right? That's the ordinary retail investor that has a do it yourself approach. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mag-7-turned-mid-7-150505452.html

We are watching Adobe, Uber, and Dick's Sporting Goods, and Coreweave. First up, Adobe set to report second quarter results after the close. Second quarter revenue guidance came in slightly below Wall Street expectations when the company last reported here. You're taking a look at shares of ADBE. They are flat here during today's trading session. There have been a lot of things that we've been tracking within Adobe, and especially with regard to how quickly they're able to implement some of those AI features within their existing platforms for creatives out there that are buying into a lot of the subscriptions and the plans that Adobe has been able to put into market for years to come and how much of a delta there is between those user experiences as well at the end of the day. .Yeah, I think this space, there's a lot of competition here, and uh, I think Adobe, the stock has struggled quite a bit. So, we would be cautious with this name. .And again, this goes back to our theme of trying to be broad and sticking with, uh, having a breadth in the portfolio to protect you on the downside. .You know, as I'm taking a look at some of the areas specifically within the segments that investors are going to be looking across when this company does report earnings, it's expected that they'll report digital media segment revenue of about $17.3 billion far and away, the major leader on a segment basis here, but you've also got the digital experience which includes the cloud subscriptions and other digital experiences. Uh, but the cloud subscriptions essentially coming in at $5.1 billion is what they're looking for here of that overall $5.8 billion pie for the digital experience side. So, ultimately, we'll see exactly where those numbers come in at, but it still is a larger question for some of their bigger corporate clients, what's the deal scrutiny and what that pipeline looks like for some of the seats that sit underneath of these services as well here, it seems. .Sure. Yeah, and with businesses scaling back a little bit because of the uncertainty, I think that could affect the company as well. So, those are all things to watch in the earnings report. .Next up here, we're also tracking Uber and Dick's Sporting Goods announcing a partnership bringing the retailers products to the Uber Eats platform. Consumers can now order equipment, apparel, and more for on-demand delivery through the app. You're taking a look at shares of both of these companies here, and they are moving fractionally lower as we are seeing with the broader markets. I saw this this morning, and it immediately said to me, you know what, this is not bad. Imagine you're at the beach one day. You're with your friends and hey, yo, we forgot the ball. Like we can't do the activity that we were hoping to and so now we can perhaps through Uber Eats, both, you know, get a pizza delivered to the beach as well as whatever softball or baseball or you know, I don't know. People are not playing pickleball at the beach these days, not yet, but they'll figure out a way. Um, you know, a sand wedge, perhaps, if you're going to be practicing on the beach, just don't hit anybody with that golf ball. Get the foam balls. But we look at all the ways that Uber Eats has tried to really entrench itself, how is this fitting into the overall kind of super appification, if you will, of Uber's strategy from your perspective? .I think they have done a phenomenal job, right? With where they've they've got a very diversified business mix. It went from this hyper growth company into a very diversified company that's that's a core company right now to look at. .Uh, they're firing on all cylinders, you know, they've got this Uber delivery. I think this partnership is phenomenal. I agree with you. .Uh, they've got the subscription business with the advertising, they've got the autonomous vehicle, they've got the ride sharing. I think Uber Eats, I use it all the time, you know, so I think I think this is this is very positive. .Yeah. .Big time for Dick's Sporting Goods too, especially coming off of the announcement of the acquisition that's going to be moving forward with Foot Locker here. So, maybe I don't know. Some of those shoe boxes that would usually be coming straight from Dick's Sporting Goods might also be coming from Foot Locker via an Uber Eats delivery. We will see how that plays out indeed. .Finally here, we want to talk about one more name that we're tracking. This one is Coreweave, one of these recent IPOs of course set to provide computing capacity to Google's cloud unit. This, according to a report from Reuters. Google will then sell that computing capacity to OpenAI as part of its newly signed partnership enhancing OpenAI's computing power here. This for Coreweave has been one that has been absolutely off into the races for investors that are trying to get some type of exposure into the IPO markets that and the IPO market, those companies that are making their public debutes and clearly have a solid business model at least. How is this kind of setting the tone for what we're also going to hear a little bit more about today with chime's IPO and the broader landscape for public debutes right now? .Yeah, I think I think the appetite is going to eventually what what's happening right now is that there's still a lot of uncertainty, but slowly we are seeing some of this appetite come back. Yeah. And we saw the inflation data, and if the inflation data continues to be to show that inflation is falling, and we start getting rate cuts after the summer, I think we should start to see the IPO market pick up more. .And that's part of the reasons why we think that some of the financials will do well because not only because of deregulation, but also because of investment banking activity as well, and IPO activity picking up. .Absolutely.

Undeterred by an eye-watering cost to borrow that’s hit about 150% of the stock price, there are plenty of traders willing to bet against CoreWeave, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics..“A lot of new guys think this new price level is an extraordinarily attractive short,” Dusaniwsky said. “Shorts are staying in because they believe the expected P&L more than offsets the financing costs.”.Borrow fees, which are annualized, are typically much lower for most other stocks. Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc., for example, both have borrow fees of less than 1%..CoreWeave’s heavy spending and the run up in its shares have made the company a popular target for short sellers, who borrow a stock and sell it with the aim of buying it back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. The bears have gotten some relief from a two-day slump this week, but CoreWeave shares gained as much as 3.4% in early trading on Thursday after a report that the firm won new business from Google..CoreWeave rents cloud computing capacity to customers like Microsoft Corp. and is expanding rapidly amid brisk demand for AI infrastructure. However, that growth requires a lot of investment, which prompted CoreWeave last month to forecast capital spending of as much as $23 billion in its current fiscal year. The company is projected to lose $934 million this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg..Felix Wang, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, recommended shorting CoreWeave in April and has watched in disbelief as the stock has pushed higher. Still, Wang is sticking with his call and remains skeptical that CoreWeave will be able to obtain larger, new multi-year contracts in the coming years..“My belief is that there is no path forward on them reaching profitability in at least a few years and losses will continue to go higher and higher,” he said in an interview. “It’s hard, but I’m trying to screen out the noise and the meme volatility.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-shorts-face-150-borrow-133523404.html

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla's TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL and Baidu BIDU..Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:.Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi service is finally nearing its launch, which is tentatively set for June 22. Yesterday, CEO Elon Musk reposted a video on X showing a driverless Tesla navigating the streets of Austin, TX, sparking fresh excitement among investors. The video featured a Model Y making turns without a human driver, hinting that Tesla's robotaxi ambitions may be finally coming to life..When asked about the launch date, Musk replied that Tesla plans to start public rides with its robotaxis on June 22. This would mark the first time Tesla offers fully self-driving rides to customers. Musk added that the first trip from the Tesla factory to a customer's house is scheduled for his birthday on June 28. However, he also cautioned that safety remains the top priority, and the timeline could still shift if needed..The initial rollout won't be massive — at least not yet. Tesla plans to start small, with about 10-20 Model Y SUVs giving rides around Austin. For now, there will still be remote human supervision to make sure everything runs smoothly. If everything goes well, Tesla would expand to other states like California, though tougher regulations there might slow things down..Tesla's been busy testing these cars on Austin's streets, using its latest Full Self-Driving software. The video Musk shared showed a Model Y, clearly labeled ""Robotaxi,"" smoothly navigating an intersection on its own with no driver in sight..Musk has bet heavily on self-driving technology as the future of Tesla. The company sees robotaxis as a potential game-changing revenue stream, especially as competition heats up in the core EV market. If Tesla can successfully pull this off, it could be a huge breakthrough for both the company and the broader autonomous driving industry. But as always with Tesla, investors may want to keep expectations in check. Challenges around safety, regulation and the complexity of full autonomy still loom large..While Tesla is just about to enter the robotaxi market, some competitors like Alphabet and Baidu are already far ahead. Alphabet's Waymo has built a significant lead. Waymo is currently running commercial robotaxi services in four U.S. cities. The company offers over 250,000 paid rides per week, thanks to years of testing, experience, and strong partnerships. Alphabet has also committed to investing $5 billion in Waymo over the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-tesla-131600230.html

The translucent material reflects and refracts its surroundings and intelligently adapts between light and dark environments. Liquid Glass makes apps and system experiences more expressive, offering users greater focus on content..At WWDC25, the company announced new Apple Intelligence features like Live Translation, updates to visual intelligence, as well as enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji. Shortcuts can access Apple Intelligence directly. Developers also get access to the on-device large language model, which is at the core of Apple Intelligence. The latest features are now available for testing and are expected to be generally available this fall with supported devices..Apple is expanding Services with AutoMix and Lyrics Translation features in Apple Music. Sing will allow users to transform their iPhones into a handheld microphone for Apple TV, while preferred routes and visited places in Apple Map make navigation easier for users.

Meanwhile, Apple Pay expands the ability to pay with rewards and installments to in-store purchases for added flexibility and choice..The latest features and the Liquid Glass software design bode well for Apple's prospects, although Apple Intelligence features lacked the ""wow"" factor.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AppLovin Corp. APP, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM..Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:.AppLovin Corp. has delivered a stunning 50% surge over the past three months, significantly outperforming the industry's 21% rally. In contrast, heavyweights in the in-game mobile advertising space, such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms, have gained 7% and 14%, respectively, during the same period..With digital ad giants regaining momentum, market sentiment appears to be turning favorable for ad tech firms. This article evaluates whether AppLovin remains a compelling buy amid this uptrend..AppLovin has solidified its leadership in mobile advertising, powered by its next-gen AI engine, Axon 2, which launched in the second quarter of 2023. Since its debut, Axon 2 has radically enhanced AppLovin's ad performance, helping to quadruple advertising spend on its platform..This explosive growth has led to an estimated $10 billion annual run rate in ad spend from gaming clients, pushing AppLovin into the upper echelon of global ad tech firms by valuation..Axon 2's importance goes far beyond mere optimization. In a post-Identifier for Advertisers environment that disrupted mobile user acquisition strategies, Axon 2 served as a critical catalyst for recovery. While Western mobile gaming experienced stagnation in 2022, Axon 2 reignited ad-driven momentum. Though in-app purchases are seeing modest, mid-single-digit growth, AppLovin's MAX publisher base is expanding at a significantly faster rate, underscoring Axon 2's strategic advantage..Google, Microsoft and Salesforce are rapidly advancing generative AI. Microsoft integrates AI in Office via Copilot and expands Azure's AI. Google embeds AI in Workspace and enhances Vertex AI. Salesforce incorporates AI across its CRM, especially through Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud. Microsoft is also focusing on AI governance, while Google is strengthening AI security.

2025-06-12 20:00:00,Waymo rides cost more than Uber or Lyft — and people are paying anyway,A new analysis done by ride-hailing aggregator Obi shows Waymos cost more especially on shorter trips. They also have longer wait times.,"A central premise of robotaxis is that high usage and lower labor costs will ultimately make it a cheap transportation option. That is still far from true, but now there’s some data that gives us an idea of by how much..Obi, an app that aggregates real-time pricing and pick-up times across multiple ride-hailing services, has just published what it’s calling the “first in-depth examination of Waymo’s pricing strategy.” The company found Waymo’s self-driving car rides to be consistently more expensive than comparative offerings from Uber and Lyft — and it doesn’t seem to matter..The report, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, is based on a month’s worth of data collected between March 25 and April 25 in San Francisco, California. Obi pulled nearly 90,000 “offer records” from Waymo, Lyft’s “standard” offering, and UberX in order to compare price and ETA. It then compared ride requests from the same times and routes. Obi found Lyft offered the lowest average price at $14.44. Uber was next at $15.58. Waymo’s average price across the month’s worth of data was $20.43..Ashwini Anburajan, Obi’s chief revenue officer, told TechCrunch this was somewhat surprising given the early popularity of Waymo’s service. Waymo said in May it’s providing 250,000 paid trips per week across its first four cities. Higher pricing has apparently not dimmed that excitement..“Colloquially, there is an idea that autonomous vehicles are something that will erode driver jobs and put drivers at risk. And I think the irony of what we’ve seen is that it’s actually quite expensive to run an AV, and that that’s not going to be happening, at least in the near term,” she said..At peak hours, Obi found Waymo’s average price to be about $11 more expensive than a Lyft and nearly $9.50 pricier than an Uber..“I didn’t expect consumers being willing to pay up to $10 more,” Anburajan said. “I think [that] speaks to a real sense of excitement for technology, novelty, and a real preference to sometimes be in the car without a driver.”.Obi found that not only was Waymo more expensive, but there was greater variability in its pricing than with Uber or Lyft..Anburajan said one explanation is that Waymo’s pricing model is not as sophisticated. Uber and Lyft, she said, have had more than a decade to refine how they price rides. Those platforms are also a bit more dynamic, with drivers clocking in and out on their own time, or joining or abandoning the gig work altogether..Waymo, meanwhile, has a mostly fixed but slowly growing supply of vehicles (though the pace of that growth may soon accelerate). This has led to what Anburajan said is more of a “pure supply and demand” pricing scheme.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-rides-cost-more-uber-120000828.html

Instead, buy the dip on these four fabulous dividend winners.","Good stocks don't become cheap without some adversity..These four companies face challenges, but will likely overcome them..Buying them right now could look like a genius move in hindsight..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Almost nobody enjoys it when stock prices fall, but it's going to happen. Prices fluctuate; it's a part of life in the stock market..Ironically, smart investing decisions often don't feel good in the moment. When prices decline, it can be an opportunity to invest in awesome companies at lower valuations, which frequently translates to better investment returns in the future..The tricky part, though, is that highly regarded stocks don't come cheap unless there is some adversity. When they do stumble, it's crucial to distinguish between companies with temporary setbacks and those with more serious problems..Here are four fabulous dividend stocks trading between 15% and 45% off their all-time highs today. They all have some question marks, but will probably work through them, making them worth buying on the dip..Technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), Google's parent company, is down approximately 15% from its high. There has been some noise surrounding Alphabet, with concerns that ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) models will impact its search engine business, as well as antitrust litigation that could eventually force it to divest assets. Yet the company continues to perform, with 12% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025, including nearly 10% revenue growth in Google Search..Alphabet announced its first dividend last summer. Investors are probably not buying Alphabet for its yield, which currently stands at just 0.5%. What investors are getting, though, is a dividend-paying technology stock, a rarity, especially one with such strong growth prospects across artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing, and autonomous driving. The stock trades at under 20 times earnings, a bargain for a company that analysts expect to grow at a 15% annualized rate over the long term..Weapons and defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) plays an enormous role in how the U.S. operates on the global stage. The company develops some of America's most advanced equipment and technology across land, sea, air, and space. Lockheed Martin is most known for the F-35 Lightning II program, which could last until 2088, meaning it will generate revenue for decades to come..Lockheed Martin is a longtime dividend rockstar, having raised its dividend for 22 consecutive years. Investors receive a solid starting yield of 2.7% at the current share price. The stock is 27% below its all-time high as efforts to cut government spending dominated headlines. However, it seems that military spending will remain largely untouched. Analysts expect Lockheed Martin to grow its earnings by an average of nearly 13% annually over the long term, making the stock a juicy buy at just under 21 times earnings.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-dividend-stocks-double-now-110000480.html

2025-06-18 17:35:00,1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Could Set You Up for Life,"Alphabet's most recent financial results were solid.  The company's advertising, cloud computing, and AI businesses have excellent prospects.  Alphabet could face some headwinds, but it should deliver superior returns in the long run.","Lemonade is revolutionizing the insurance business by using artificial intelligence to rapidly write quotes and settle claims..Lemonade's in-force premium recently crossed $1 billion for the first time, but management thinks it could grow tenfold within a decade or so..Lemonade stock is trading at near the cheapest level since it went public, and it could be a great long-term buy..10 stocks we like better than Lemonade ›.Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) has been developing artificial intelligence (AI) since 2015, long before the technology captivated Wall Street a couple of years ago. The company is using AI to transform the insurance industry by writing quotes in seconds, and paying claims in minutes instead of days or weeks..Lemonade has attracted over 2.5 million customers so far across its homeowners, renters, life, pet, and car insurance products, and the company has outlined a plan to grow its business tenfold over the next decade..Lemonade stock is down 75% from its record high set during the tech market frenzy in 2021. It was unquestionably overvalued back then, but it's now trading at an attractive level in light of the company's growth and its future potential. Here's why the stock could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now..Most traditional insurance companies have cumbersome processes, especially when it comes to claims. But Lemonade's AI-powered approach prioritizes automation, which ensures a fast and convenient customer experience. The company's AI chatbot, Maya, can provide an insurance quote in under 90 seconds via the Lemonade website, and for existing policyholders, AI Jim can settle claims in less than three minutes..Lemonade also uses AI to calculate the most accurate premiums, which can save customers a significant amount of money over the long term. The company's lifetime value models use AI to predict the likelihood of each policyholder making a claim, switching insurers, and buying multiple policies. These models also assist with operational duties like marketing by identifying underperforming products or geographic locations so management can make strategic adjustments to maximize revenue..In the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), Lemonade highlighted some of the benefits of its AI approach. The company grew its in-force premium (IFP) by 24% year over year during that quarter (which is the value of premiums from all active policies) while reducing its workforce by 7% at the same time. In other words, Lemonade is bringing in more money per employee thanks to automation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-093500675.html

As a result, many stocks still look expensive in today's market..Finding a bargain among them sometimes requires looking at stocks beaten down in recent months. Short-term challenges can often create great opportunities for long-term investors..And even if you miss the exact rock-bottom price on a stock, you'll have plenty of opportunities to buy shares. The phrase ""The markets take the stairs up and the elevator down"" can work in your favor here, giving you time to assess a company's recovery from any setbacks..One such stock worth examining more closely is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). It fell over 67% from its all-time high reached at the end of last year. You could still buy shares for about half of that peak as of June 9. Here's why you don't want to miss this incredible opportunity..About two years ago, The Trade Desk announced a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Kokai, for buying ads. It was designed to help marketers optimize bid prices for ads, improve targeting and measurement, and generally make the most of their advertising budgets..Management is constantly adding new features to the platform as well. The more it can improve advertisers' results, the more business it is positioned to win..The push to transition customers from its legacy platform to Kokai went slowly, ultimately leading to a major shake-up in the company's personnel and operations in the fourth quarter. Operational struggles combined with challenges related to Kokai led to the first earnings report where the company missed its own internal revenue forecast since going public in 2016..The massive earnings miss led to a big sell-off in the stock. That was compounded as the Trump administration enacted new tariffs. The growing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs led many to expect businesses to pull back on advertising, which directly weighed on The Trade Desk..Management outlined 15 factors that give it long-term confidence in the business, including internal factors like simplifying its platform, investing in AI, and completing the customer transition to Kokai.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-miss-incredible-opportunity-1-083000095.html

Between the Trump administration's tariff plans (and subsequent backtracks), recession fears, and overall uncertainty, the stock market has been more volatile than usual..Due to the uncertainty, investors have been heading toward value and dividend stocks, shifting away from the growth stocks that have been so popular in recent years. And while this is a strategic move to minimize risk, all isn't lost with growth stocks..One growth stock in particular that I would consider is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). With a market cap of more than $2 trillion (as of June 9), Alphabet may not seem like your typical growth stock, but it checks the boxes. And right now, it's a bargain worth considering..It's been a tough start to the year for Alphabet, down more than 8% through June 9 and essentially flat over the past 12 months. Of course, this isn't ideal for shareholders, but it does make the stock a lot more attractive for those looking to add shares or make their first purchase..At around 18 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is trading below the market (compared to the S&P 500) and is much cheaper than peers like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta..Trading at a relatively low value alone doesn't make Alphabet's stock a buy, but it does make the upside far outweigh the downside..Alphabet has consistently been one of the top money-making businesses in the world. With subsidiaries that include Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, and dozens of others, it's easy to see why..For perspective, Alphabet made $90.2 billion in revenue in the first quarter (up 12% year over year), more than companies like FedEx, Johnson & Johnson, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have made in their last four quarters combined..Despite the billions Alphabet makes, it's hard to ignore the concentration of the company's revenue streams. Advertising, which includes Google Search and YouTube ads, accounted for more than 74% ($66.9 billion) of Alphabet's total revenue.

(NVDA) will take minority stakes in Skild AI Inc. as they seek to bolster their work in the emerging consumer robotics industry..Most Read from Bloomberg.Shuttered NY College Has Alumni Fighting Over Its Future.Trump’s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry.NYC Renters Brace for Price Hikes After Broker-Fee Ban.NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire.Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?.The South Korean tech leader is making a $10 million investment in Skild, which develops software for robots, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker is putting in $25 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced plans..The financing is part of the company’s Series B funding round, which will value the company at around $4.5 billion and is led by a $100 million investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T, SFTBY).Internally, Samsung views its Skild investment as a way to keep visibility into the startup and its talent without needing to make a significant commitment. Another reason: to keep pace with other South Korean conglomerates like LG, Hanwha and Mirae Asset, which all have divisions putting between $5 million to $10 million into Skild..Nvidia has begun to push the idea of “physical AI” — meaning robots and autonomous vehicles — becoming a significant future revenue driver as the technology matures. The chipmaker has semiconductors, software and services aimed at speeding up the deployment of robots that can think for themselves..Samsung considers some aspects of Skild’s solutions inferior to others in the market, said some of the people. Representatives for Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment. A representative for Skild didn’t respond to an inquiry..Robotics are quickly becoming a major area of future growth for the world’s technology companies, with Apple Inc (AAPL)., Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Google all investing heavily in the space. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), meanwhile, has long been preparing to ship its Optimus robot..A few months ago, Samsung took a minority stake in Physical Intelligence, which also develops underlying robotics algorithms, with a small investment. The startup has already raised around $400 million and was last valued at about $2.4 billion. Nvidia has invested in companies like Figure AI and Serve Robotics..Samsung already sells robot vacuums, but its ambitions go deeper to include humanoid robots and other household appliances.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-samsung-plan-investments-robotics-001732590.html

Impacted teams include knowledge and information (K&I), central engineering, marketing, research and communications..K&I, which oversees Google's search, ads and commerce operations, has roughly 20,000 staff..Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today..In its most recent quarterly report, Alphabet disclosed that Google Search and related services generated $50.7 billion of the company's total revenue of $90.23 billion. When including all advertising streams—such as Search, YouTube ads and Google Network—the total advertising revenue reached $66.89 billion for the quarter, underscoring how central these business lines remain to Google's overall financial performance..The latest buyouts follow previous headcount reductions dating back to 2023..CNBC reported that finance chief Anat Ashkenazi previously cited cost-cutting as a key priority amid rising AI infrastructure spending. Google has also implemented return-to-office requirements for some remote employees living within 50 miles of a company location..A memo from K&I chief Nick Fox encouraged employees who are disengaged or underperforming to consider the exit package. However, he urged those excited by their roles and aligned with the company's goals to stay..Earlier this year, similar buyouts were offered in the ""Platforms and Devices"" and ""People Operations"" units. Google is also shifting internal training resources toward practical AI tools and away from less essential programs, CNBC added..See Also: Invest Where It Hurts — And Help Millions Heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold..Why It Matters: Ongoing cost-cutting efforts at Google underscore the company's broader strategy to reallocate resources toward artificial intelligence infrastructure..In February, Google planned voluntary buyouts in its People Operations division beginning in March. Some mid to senior-level staff were offered 14 weeks of severance plus an additional week for each year of service..The company also laid off operations support employees in its cloud unit, with some roles relocated to India and Mexico City. Despite this shift, the memo stated the U.S. would remain the cloud team's largest hub.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-expands-buyouts-search-ads-233128996.html

It may not be the last, as companies face pressure to reduce spending amid an uncertain economic environment, while also investing in AI infrastructure..Tech has seen an exodus in 2025. The sector has announced nearly 75,000 job cuts in 2025 as of the end of May, according to a report last week from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, up from about 55,000 cuts in the same period in 2024..Within the last two months alone, reports emerged that Microsoft (MSFT) is looking to cut 3% of its global workforce, or roughly 7,000 jobs, and Amazon (AMZN) reportedly trimmed about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit. Intel (INTC) intends to cut a whopping 20% of its workforce this year, as the embattled chipmaker attempts to turn around its business..While software and cloud giants like Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) may be seen as better-equipped to weather tariff-fueled uncertainty than many other companies with more direct exposure, worries about the economy in the face of rapidly shifting trade policies could still hold back demand, analysts have warned..Another factor at play is huge AI infrastructure investments announced by Microsoft, Alphabet and others. That spending puts greater pressure on profit margins, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Investopedia, meaning companies “are either keeping lower levels of hiring for personnel, or even sometimes taking action to reduce personnel.” Advancements also make it possible for companies to rely on smaller teams of software developers, Luria added..Microsoft, for example, has said it plans to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures this year. Luria estimates that for every year Microsoft invests at current levels, there are 10,000 positions the company could have to either let go unfilled or cut..Read the original article on Investopedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-buyouts-could-point-more-213057759.html

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar. On June 10, Reuters reported that OpenAI is planning to add Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity. Despite being competitors in the artificial intelligence space, the collaboration is a surprising highlight of the strategic need for companies to pool resources to accelerate AI adoption..According to the sources, the deal was under discussion for a few months and was finalized in May. The massive demand for computing to train and deploy AI models significantly reshapes competitive dynamics, highlighting OpenAI’s latest efforts to diversify its compute sources beyond Microsoft..Google’s cloud unit will now supply additional computing capacity to OpenAI’s existing infrastructure for training and running its AI models, a major win for the company..Discussing the aforementioned deal, Scotiabank analysts have deemed the development to be “somewhat surprising.” They pointed toward growth opportunities for Google’s Cloud unit and also expressed caution regarding competition from ChatGPT..“The deal … underscores the fact that the two are willing to overlook heavy competition between them to meet the massive computing demands. Ultimately, we view this as a big win for Google’s cloud unit, but … there are continued worries that ChatGPT is becoming an incrementally larger threat to Google’s search dominance.”.While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
