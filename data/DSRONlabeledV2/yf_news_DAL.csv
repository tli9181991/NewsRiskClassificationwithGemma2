1,2025-06-26 18:01:00,JetBlue's second-largest investor will consider selling stake without changes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -JetBlue Airways' second-largest investor, Vladimir Galkin, is threatening to sell his near 10% stake in the struggling air carrier if the company's cost-cutting plan and other broader efforts fail to turn around its performance.  Galkin, who lives in Miami, Florida, was a big winner from Gamestop's ""meme stock"" rally in 2021 and invested over $200 million in JetBlue between February and August 2024.  Shares are down 43% year-to-date, while peers Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are down 17% and 18%, respectively.","By Doyinsola Oladipo.NEW YORK (Reuters) -JetBlue Airways' (JBLU) second-largest investor, Vladimir Galkin, is threatening to sell his near 10% stake in the struggling air carrier if the company's cost-cutting plan and other broader efforts fail to turn around its performance..Galkin, who lives in Miami, Florida, was a big winner from Gamestop's (GME) ""meme stock"" rally in 2021 and invested over $200 million in JetBlue between February and August 2024. The New York air carrier has been struggling with weakened travel demand, as the company withdrew its full-year forecast in April, saying it is unlikely to break even in 2025..Shares are down 43% year-to-date, while peers Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are down 17% and 18%, respectively. That's left Galkin sitting on a losing position..""I am underwater a little bit and just going to have to hold on to it. I don't want to say for as long as it takes, obviously, but maybe for another year,"" Galkin told Reuters. He has approximately 35 million shares, or $212 million invested in the company, according to a September U.S. regulatory filing, a position he confirmed with Reuters..JetBlue in June reiterated plans to cut costs and focus on more profitable routes. Galkin said the memo was positive, but that the company's ""trajectory will be evident"" in coming quarters..He said JetBlue should consider reducing the size of its 13-member board to also cut costs, but did not say what other cuts he would make..""The cost savings measures from the recent memo are part of JetForward and a continuation of our previously stated commitment to reduce costs, particularly as the industry as a whole has seen a macroeconomic step back in consumer demand,"" the company said in a statement..JetForward is the company's multi-year plan to boost profits and deliver $800 million to $900 million in earnings before interest and taxes through 2027..Galkin later said selling in one year was not a set deadline as he is hopeful JetBlue will start making money ""sooner rather than later."".He added that he thinks Wall Street is underestimating the potential of JetBlue's collaboration with United, which will allow travelers to book flights on both carriers' websites beginning in 2027..JetBlue has reported profits in two of the last nine quarters. As of May 23rd, 10 equity analysts have a hold recommendation on the stock, with five ""sell"" and two ""strong sell"" ratings, according to LSEG data. There are no ""buy"" ratings.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblues-second-largest-investor-consider-100119946.html,"```json

Tokyo ranks second only to London and above Paris, which landed third on online travel booking site Kayak’s list of most popular destinations this summer..“Trips to Japan are really in fashion right now,” United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, calling it one of the airline’s “hottest destinations” for the summer..“Everybody is trying to take the family to Japan. I’m not sure we’ll have enough seats, to be frank.”.United is one of the biggest beneficiaries as it flies more flights — and passengers — to Japan than any other US carrier. But American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) have increased the number of seats they’re flying to Tokyo this summer to keep up with demand..Those Pacific routes and other international service have bolstered revenue at the biggest US airlines, helping to insulate them from a sudden slump in domestic air travel over the past few months that has pinched carriers focused on serving destinations in the US..Long a cost-prohibitive port of call for budget-minded American travelers, a multi-day stay in Japan has become much more affordable as a result of lower airfares and a favorable foreign exchange market. So it’s suddenly back on top of many travelers’ bucket lists..“If they’re looking for value, given where currency is on the yen side, going to Japan right now makes a lot of sense,” said Conor Cunningham, a Melius Research analyst..The yen has tumbled against the dollar over the past four years and isn't far from its weakest levels in almost four decades. That has depressed demand for outbound travel from Japan, but increased purchasing power for inbound American visitors. One-thousand dollars gets travelers almost 146,000 yen now. In June 2019, the same amount was worth roughly 108,000 yen..“It can make a huge difference to the demand for a destination,” said John Grant, chief analyst for Luton, UK-based OAG.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-trips-japan-surpass-paris-093039711.html,"```json

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ACHR. Archer Aviation Inc's share was trading at $ 10.20 as of June 18th..Marina Zezelina / Shutterstock.com.Archer Aviation is a frontrunner in the emerging electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry, aiming to revolutionize urban air mobility with its innovative aircraft design and operational model. The company recently secured $850 million in funding, bringing its total liquidity to around $2 billion—an amount expected to sufficiently fund Archer through key operational milestones, including FAA certification and the launch of commercial services..This strong financial position significantly de-risks its near-term execution and supports its strategic roadmap. Archer’s credibility in the marketplace is bolstered by high-profile partnerships with major airline players such as United Airlines and Delta, which not only validate the viability of its technology but also open immediate go-to-market channels..These relationships also provide Archer with logistical, operational, and regulatory leverage that smaller players in the space lack. Furthermore, the regulatory backdrop for the eVTOL sector is increasingly constructive. Recent executive orders and federal support for advanced air mobility initiatives reflect a broader government push towards decarbonization and next-generation transportation systems..These tailwinds suggest that Archer is well-positioned to gain a first-mover advantage in a sector poised for exponential growth. With a compelling combination of financial strength, strategic alliances, and a favourable policy environment, Archer is primed to capitalize on a transformative shift in urban transportation..If successful in meeting certification timelines and commercial rollout plans, the company could dominate a multi-billion-dollar market, offering substantial upside for long-term investors while mitigating traditional early-stage aerospace risks..Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Archer Aviation Inc. by Xtianus25 in January 2025, which highlighted the company's certification progress, potential piloted flight demonstrations, and expansion plans in the UAE and Middle East. The company's stock price has appreciated by approximately 10% since our coverage. This is because the certification milestones and partnership speculations have begun to materialize..The thesis still stands as Archer remains on track for commercial launch with robust international support. Pitchstack Investing shares a similar outlook but emphasizes Archer’s strengthened financial position and regulatory tailwinds as key drivers of long-term value.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-aviation-inc-achr-bull-235152966.html,"```json

But are his criticisms still valid, or have carriers like Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) altered the way investors should view the industry?.The airline industry has historically struggled to generate the returns to cover its cost of capital. This is a point recognized by the International Air Transport Association and by Buffett himself. The legendary investor has argued that airlines' high fixed costs and the low marginal cost of adding extra seating and capacity lead to a tendency to ramp up capacity while also selling tickets at a low price..It's essential to note that when Buffett and others speak disparagingly about the airline industry and the returns it has generated for investors, they are typically referring to equity investors in airlines..In contrast, bond investors have tended to do well, and airlines appear to have little difficulty attracting capital to the industry, not least because bonds are commonly securitized against valuable assets, namely the planes. It's also been an excellent industry for suppliers of airline equipment..In Berkshire Hathaway's annual letter in 2007, Buffett wrote: ""The airline industry's demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable. Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it."".In 1990, he called out the self-destructive pricing tactics of certain carriers. And in 1992's letter, he talked about airlines acting like members of a competitive tontine -- an arrangement whereby the participants contribute equally to a prize that goes to the lone survivor -- that they wish to conclude ""as rapidly as possible."".The general theme of a capital-intensive industry, with relatively small and ever-at-risk profit margins, containing participants who don't always act rationally, would go a long way to explaining why airlines have struggled to cover their cost of capital..That said, there's a strong case for arguing that the airline industry is different now. As mentioned previously, Delta and United Airlines are both consistently generating a return on invested capital (ROIC) that exceeds their weighted average cost of capital (WACC), a key requirement for generating value for shareholders.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-united-airlines-114200450.html,"```json

On June 18, Bernstein analyst David Vernon revised his near-term view on Delta Air Lines, trimming the price target slightly to $60 from $61 while maintaining an Outperform rating..The analyst’s downward adjustment to the target price reflect his latest hike in fuel cost estimates. He attributes the rise to the growing geopolitical risks and the ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel. The analyst notes that while airlines can typically pass fuel costs onto consumers through higher fares, in such scenarios, the pricing power weakens, especially if geopolitical concerns hit traveler sentiment. Thus, it becomes difficult for companies to pass on the costs to consumers during supply-driven price shocks..Pixabay/Public Domain.Bernstein also notes that the continued uncertainty in the Middle East could dampen demand during the summer travel period which is important for the sector. This adds another layer of complexity to forecasting near-term performance, prompting a more cautious stance in earnings estimates..Despite these pressures, Vernon’s overall rating remains positive, suggesting confidence in Delta’s longer-term positioning and operational strength even as short-term headwinds persist..Delta Air Lines Inc. provides scheduled air transportation for passengers, freight, and mail over a network of routes..While we acknowledge the potential of DAL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

19,2025-06-23 22:09:00,3 Transportation Dividend Growth Stocks to Keep an Eye On,"EXPD, FDX and DAL raise dividends amid sector pressures, signaling strength through disciplined capital returns.","The widely diversified Zacks Transportation sector is facing multiple headwinds, ranging from escalated expenses, inflation-induced elevated interest rates, a downturn in freight demand and supply-chain woes. Geopolitical uncertainties and tariff-related issues continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations..The recent U.S. strikes on Iran and the threat of a Strait of Hormuz closure have driven up oil prices, raising concerns of a broader supply shock that could significantly impact the U.S. economy. Higher crude costs are pushing up gasoline and diesel prices, fueling inflation and squeezing consumer spending. This adds pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated, potentially slowing economic growth..As a result, transportation players may face rising costs, as fuel expenses represent one of the major input costs for these companies. The increase in labor costs is also limiting bottom-line growth..Due to the aforementioned headwinds, the sector has declined 10.1% year over year against the S&P 500’s 9.3% growth..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.But do the above-mentioned challenges and rising costs mean investors should steer clear of transportation sector stocks? The answer is a clear no..We believe dividend-growth transportation stocks deserve a place on investors’ watchlists as they offer resilience amid market headwinds and volatility. Companies with a consistent track record of increasing dividends year over year tend to contribute to stronger, more balanced portfolios, offering not just reliable income but greater potential for long-term capital appreciation compared to high-yield or flat-dividend stocks..Investing in dividend stocks is a prudent strategy that offers a dual advantage: steady income and a cushion against market volatility. It's no wonder investors actively seek companies with a consistent and growing dividend history. These stocks provide a reliable income stream, acting as a buffer during market downturns and contributing to overall portfolio stability..To guide investors interested in the transportation sector, we came up with certain parameters using the Zacks Stocks Screener. We shortlisted transportation stocks based on the following:.a) A dividend payout ratio of less than 60% (the dividend payout ratio — dividends paid/net income — gives the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A payout ratio below 60 looks quite sustainable)..b) A dividend yield of greater than 1% (dividend yield denotes the percentage of a company’s share price that it shells out as dividends annually).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-transportation-dividend-growth-stocks-140900775.html,"```json

20,2025-06-22 20:35:00,Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,"The board of Delta Air Lines, Inc. ( NYSE:DAL ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 25% on the...","The board of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 25% on the 21st of August to $0.1875, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.15. This takes the annual payment to 1.3% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying..We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free..If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, Delta Air Lines' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow..Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 30.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 8.5% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.. See our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines .Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.36 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.2% over that duration. We like to see dividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income..Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Delta Air Lines hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years. While growth may be thin on the ground, Delta Air Lines could always pay out a higher proportion of earnings to increase shareholder returns..Overall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. While the payout ratios are a good sign, we are less enthusiastic about the company's dividend record. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious..Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

In that line of thought, here are 10 growth stock ideas for investors to consider. They range from a couple of high-profile household names, such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), to companies like Navitas Semiconductor (NASDAQ: NVTS) and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS), which are less well known..You might want to consider buying and holding any (or all) of these equities long-term..The key to the investment case for Tesla lies in its promised robotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software, which is scheduled to launch on a limited basis beginning this week. Tesla is already a highly successful automaker and the dominant player in electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., and robotaxis offer the prospect of transforming it into a company able to generate high-margin and recurring revenue from owning its robotaxi fleet or revenue sharing from Tesla's transformed fleet using Full Self-Driving (FSD) software..There's also the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, and the potential to sell FSD on a subscription basis. And all of it will be supported by Tesla's market-leading position in EVs and its ability to develop affordable EVs in the future..Nvidia partners Navitas Semiconductor and Vertiv (NYSE: VRT) and the next generation of data centers, namely 800-volt (V) high voltage direct current (HVDC), which I've discussed in more detail elsewhere, so investors with the time and inclination can peruse. Nvidia believes they will be more efficient, with lower maintenance costs and significantly lower costs of ownership..The new data centers, scheduled for 2027, employ a different power conversion method, and Navitas is developing Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) power semiconductors to enable more efficient power conversion in 800V HVDC data centers..Similarly, another Nvidia partner, and leading data center equipment provider, Vertiv, is developing critical power and cooling equipment and systems for the new data centers and expects to have them available in the second half of 2026, in time for the launch of the 800V HVDC data center in 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-brilliant-growth-stocks-buy-091000299.html,"```json

The raised dividend will be paid on Aug. 21, 2025, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 31, 2025. The move reflects DAL’s intention to utilize free cash to enhance its shareholders’ returns..Delta Air Lines, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote.DAL has been consistently making efforts to reward its shareholders, which is encouraging. We would like to remind investors that this move marks DAL’s second dividend increase after the company renewed its dividend policy in June 2023 with a dividend payment of 10 cents per share. The first dividendincrease (post-dividend renewal) was announced in June 2024..Notably, DAL had to suspend its dividend payout during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restrictions, under the CARES Act, prohibited airline companies from paying dividends or buying back shares till Sept. 30, 2022..Dividend-paying stocks provide a solid income stream and have fewer chances of experiencing wild price swings. Dividend stocks, like DAL, are safe bets for creating wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty, like the current scenario..DAL’s management’s decision to increase its quarterly dividend payout reflects the company’s commitment to boosting shareholder value, apart from underlining confidence in its business.

This contrasts the past year's results, where Delta underperformed both the US market and the US Airlines industry, indicating challenges that the airline needs to address for sustained momentum..The latest dividend announcement and capacity management strategy aim to support Delta's financial health, potentially influencing revenue and earnings positively by aligning business activities with evolving market conditions.

Delta Air Lines was named best airline in America for the seventh straight year, followed closely by United Airlines. The Points Guy uses a weighted formula to evaluate objective data from the previous year covering every aspect of a traveler's journey, from the booking process to baggage delivery, as well as the system for earning and redeeming rewards for future trips..Delta continues to top the list, showing that consistency matters for travelers – while the airline didn't necessarily score the highest in each of the four key categories analyzed (reliability, experience, cost and reach, and loyalty), its strength across all categories landed it the number one spot..United Airlines crept its way up to second place – up from last year's third position – topping Delta in loyalty rankings, and nearly giving the airline a run for its money in categories like onboard experience. Southwest made big strides this year, moving up two spots to third after offering the best cancellation rate of any U.S. airline and making significant IT investments to improve operations. Hawaiian Airlines came in at fourth, being a runner-up for overall reliability. Ultra-low-cost carriers Allegiant, Spirit and Frontier again occupied the bottom tier of the rankings, hindered by their myriad of add-on fees, loyalty programs that didn't measure up, and fewer on-board features and amenities than their larger competitors..""With changing airline policies, systemic delays and increased scrutiny on air travel, our goal at The Points Guy is to help consumers navigate the constantly changing aviation landscape,"" said Brian Kelly, Founder of The Points Guy. ""Our Best Airlines Report thoroughly analyzes and compares each airline's performance to help consumers make the right choice for them, because not all airlines are created equal. Ultimately, we want consumers to know they have a choice so they can fly the airlines that best align with their needs."".Best Airlines Report for 2025 rankings are highlighted below:.Delta Air Lines.United Airlines.Southwest Airlines.Alaska Airlines.Hawaiian Airlines.JetBlue.American Airlines.Allegiant Air.Spirit Airlines.Frontier Airlines.Standout takeaways include:.Delta continues to lead in reliability: The carrier was the top-ranking airline in this category once again, despite a Crowdstrike outage last year that led to thousands of flight cancellations. However, Southwest had the lowest cancellation rate of its competitors, putting its 2022 holiday meltdown in the rearview mirror. Frontier came in last for this category, in large part due to the astonishingly high rate of passengers bumped compared to its competitors. From 2023-2024, Frontier involuntarily bumped over 17,000 passengers, compared to Delta which bumped four total, and Allegiant, which bumped zero..Alaska comes out on top for the travel experience: The airline edged out Delta in overall experience, turning in the best marks of any airline when it came to family-friendly policies like guaranteed seats together, free lounge access for children, and early boarding for travelers with kids. It also topped the value consumers get, on average, through a paid annual lounge membership. However, JetBlue edged Alaska out for the best onboard experience, due to its signature seatback screens, free Wi-Fi and more generous legroom..Southwest's reign on cost and reach could be at risk: While Southwest continued to lead the rankings in cost and reach thanks to its vast domestic network and miniscule add-on fees, the airline's reign in this category could come to an end next year since ending its longstanding ""bags fly free"" policy and implementing a basic economy fare..United wins in loyalty: In addition to improving in two key categories versus a year prior (overall reliability and passenger experience), United once again led the loyalty rankings, lifted by its MileagePlus elite status benefits and exhaustive partner network through the Star Alliance. While the loyalty rankings looked remarkably similar to last year, there's opportunity for a shake-up in the year ahead, with plenty of changes in the works. For example, United recently made it harder to earn Premier elite status, while Alaska and Hawaiian are expected to launch a new joint loyalty program this summer and low-cost carriers like Frontier are adding more generous perks for frequent flyers to entice more customers to their programs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/points-guy-releases-ninth-annual-140000335.html,"```json

35,2025-06-18 16:05:00,Think Delta Air Lines Is Expensive? This Chart Might Change Your Mind.,Delta Air Lines consistently adds value for its shareholders.  The current trading environment heavily favors network airlines over low-cost carriers.  Loyalty programs and co-brand credit cards are diversifying Delta's revenue streams.,"Delta Air Lines consistently adds value for its shareholders..The current trading environment heavily favors network airlines over low-cost carriers..Loyalty programs and co-brand credit cards are diversifying Delta's revenue streams..10 stocks we like better than Delta Air Lines ›.Investors might not consider Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) stock expensive due to its low price-to-earnings ratio of just over 8 times earnings. Still, some of them do stress over Delta's adjusted net debt of $16.9 billion and the traditional cyclicality of its revenue and earnings. That said, I think the risk is a lot less than in previous years. Here's why..One of the longstanding, and justified, criticisms of the airline industry is that it hasn't generated a return on invested capital (ROIC) sufficient to cover its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). While airlines will all have different WACCs, a rough estimate interpolated from International Air Transport Association (IATA) figures suggests it averages around 8% or 9%..The following chart illustrates a clear bifurcation in the industry over recent years, with Delta and United Airlines' return on invested capital (ROIC) exceeding 8%, significantly ahead of American Airlines and the budget carriers. Moreover, note that the ROIC of Delta, United, and American Airlines is similar both before and after the pandemic lockdown period, while the ROIC of budget airlines has declined..There are many reasons for this bifurcation:.Rising labor, airport, and supply chain costs disproportionately hit budget airlines' low-cost and low-margin business models..It's easier for premium airlines to adjust and offer economy seats than it is for budget airlines to ""go premium."".Delta and other network airlines have substantial loyalty programs and also generate revenue through co-brand credit cards..It all comes together to create an environment where Delta and United are likely to be more resilient in a downturn, particularly against budget airlines, as demonstrated by their ROIC. As such, a lower risk should result in a more favorable risk-reward calculation for Delta, meaning it's not as expensive a stock as many think..Before you buy stock in Delta Air Lines, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Delta Air Lines wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-delta-air-lines-expensive-080500760.html,"```json

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.84%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.7%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.91%..Heading into today, shares of the airline had lost 2.87% over the past month, outpacing the Transportation sector's loss of 0% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 1.44%..Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Delta Air Lines in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.92, reflecting a 18.64% decrease from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $16.18 billion, indicating a 2.88% downward movement from the same quarter last year..Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $5.08 per share and revenue of $60.55 billion, indicating changes of -17.53% and -1.77%, respectively, compared to the previous year..It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Delta Air Lines. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the business operations and its ability to generate profits..Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model..The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.46% lower. Delta Air Lines currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold)..Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Delta Air Lines has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.74 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 9.31..It is also worth noting that DAL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.5. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Transportation - Airline industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.88 as trading concluded yesterday..The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 47, which puts it in the top 20% of all 250+ industries.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-delta-air-lines-215003989.html,"```json

[as we] continue to set new standards in aviation . . . and is a clear validation of our vision to shape the future of air travel,” Qatar Airways Group CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement..The top spots were dominated by Middle Eastern and Asian airlines known for their exceptional service, luxury cabins, and state-of-the-art in-flight products, as airlines increasingly compete for the lucrative luxury market post-pandemic. Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, and All Nippon Airways rounded out the top five placings after Qatar Airways. In all, 325 airlines were surveyed by Skytrax..In addition to its No. 2 overall ranking, Singapore Airlines was recognized for having the “world’s best cabin crew” and “world’s best first class service.” Cathay Pacific Airways moved up to third place this year and was also honored for “world’s best in-flight entertainment.” Emirates ranked No. 4, and All Nippon Airways came in fifth place, winning for “world’s best airport service.”.Here’s a look at Skytrax’s Top 20 list..1.

38,2025-06-18 01:28:00,Airline Stocks Bounce Back on Monday's Trading: Here's Why,"Airline stocks such as DAL, UAL, AAL and LUV rebounded as easing Middle East tensions drove oil prices down, lifting hopes for better margins ahead.","Players in the Zacks Airline industry have made a notable comeback by performing well on the bourses on Monday, June 17, 2025. Industry heavyweights like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) soared 5.14%, 6.11%, 5.11% and 1.48%, respectively, from Friday’s closing price. Other airline stocks like Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) have also reported upside, with their shares having gained 2.80% and 2.23%, respectively, from the previous day's closing..The NYSE ARCA Airline index, which tracks the performance of major airlines, was revised upward, consequently ending Monday’s session at $55.32, up 3.36%, further emphasizing the positive market reaction..Of the abovementioned stocks, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While United Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), American Airlines presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)..You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..Given that fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space, the decline in oil prices bodes well for the bottom-line growth of airline industry participants. To this end, crude oil futures were down about 2% on Monday following the easing of tensions between Israel and Iran. This has led to the northward movement of airline stocks..Currently, Iran is seeking to de-escalate the situation and negotiate a ceasefire with Israel and halt further military action. Such diplomatic moves by Iran have led to a reduction in market fears of global oil supply disruptions, thereby gaining investors’ confidence. The oil market calming down is a major relief to industries like airlines, which are heavily dependent on oil..The upside performance of airline stocks is being considered as a recovery because it came just after a significant downturn on Friday, June 13, 2025, when tensions in the Middle East (a critical region for global oil supply) escalated at their peak, and oil prices surged 7%. The NYSE ARCA Airline index had also dipped 4.3%. At that point, many airline stocks had dropped as investors feared the long-term impact of higher fuel prices on airline profitability..The situation then witnessed Israel launching an offensive strike aimed at Iran’s nuclear facilities and military installations, and Iran also replying swiftly with a series of missile and drone attacks. This had led to fears of a broader regional war. As an after-effect of this Israel-Iran conflict, airlines had to quickly clear Israeli, Iranian, Jordanian, and Iraqi airspace and flight operations got halted, with DAL having paused flights from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv through August 31.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stocks-bounce-back-mondays-172800219.html,"```json

Management credited the quarter’s performance to the continued resilience of higher-margin segments—particularly Premium cabins and Loyalty programs—as well as strong international travel demand. CEO Ed Bastian highlighted Delta’s “industry-leading reliability and premium service,” while President","Delta’s first quarter drew a positive market reaction, as investors responded to the airline’s ability to generate steady revenue growth and maintain profitability in a turbulent operating environment. Management credited the quarter’s performance to the continued resilience of higher-margin segments—particularly Premium cabins and Loyalty programs—as well as strong international travel demand. CEO Ed Bastian highlighted Delta’s “industry-leading reliability and premium service,” while President Glen Hauenstein noted, “approximately 60% of our total revenue now comes from diverse, high-margin streams.” Despite softness in domestic Main Cabin demand and a more challenging macroeconomic backdrop, Delta’s diversified revenue mix and operational discipline helped offset these headwinds..Is now the time to buy DAL? Find out in our full research report (it’s free). .Revenue: $14.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $13.88 billion (2.1% year-on-year growth, 1.1% beat).EPS (GAAP): $0.37 vs analyst expectations of $0.40 (6.9% miss).Adjusted EBITDA: $1.2 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.3 billion (8.5% margin, 7.8% miss).Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2025 is $16.66 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting.EPS (GAAP) guidance for Q2 CY2025 is $2 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 12.1%.Operating Margin: 4.1%, in line with the same quarter last year.Revenue Passenger Miles: 55.68 billion, up 1.47 billion year on year.Market Capitalization: $32.3 billion.While we enjoy listening to the management's commentary, our favorite part of earnings calls are the analyst questions. Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention..Conor Cunningham (Melius Research) questioned whether ongoing domestic softness could spill over to Premium and International segments. President Glen Hauenstein explained they are monitoring closely but see no evidence of weakness outside the Main Cabin yet..Andrew Didora (Bank of America) asked about the timing and geographic focus of capacity cuts. Hauenstein clarified that reductions will begin in August, concentrated in the Southeast, and mainly affect off-peak Main Cabin flights..Catherine O’Brien (Goldman Sachs) probed how Delta can maintain cost targets while reducing capacity. CFO Dan Janki detailed strategies including flexible labor scheduling, maintenance timing, and supplier negotiations..Duane Pfennigwerth (Evercore) sought specifics on which fleet types are being retired and the drivers of loyalty growth. Hauenstein noted focus on retiring 757s, 767s, and older A319/A320s, and that loyalty growth is primarily from increased cardholder spend..Tom Fitzgerald (TD Cowen) inquired about competitive dynamics and risk of customer trade-down to low-cost carriers.

Apart from the Israel-Iran tensions-induced flight cancellations, United Airlines was also in the news due to its in-flight collaboration with Spotify Technology SPOT. JetBlue Airways JBLU was also in the news in the past week due to a customer-friendly gesture. Copa Holdings CPA was also in the news courtesy of its impressive traffic numbers for May. Mexican carrier Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación VLRS or Volaris reported a year-over-year increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs: a measure of air traffic) for May..Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here..1. JetBlue’s subsidiary, JetBlue Vacations, powered by Paisly, announced the expansion of its Insider Experience program to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The JetBlue Vacations Insider Experience program was launched in 2020 and is currently available in Aruba, Cancun, Montego Bay, Punta Cana, Nassau, St. Lucia, and Tulum. Per the new expanded vacation package, all JetBlue Vacations customers booking a flight + hotel package to San Juan will also enjoy a free guided walking tour of Old San Juan, in partnership with the Municipality of San Juan..2. Per UAL’s collaboration with Spotify, the latter’s video and audio podcasts, audiobooks, and specially curated versions of Spotify's most popular playlists will be offered for free on more than 680 United planes. UAL’s customers shall enjoy the onboard streaming services on its new 4K, Bluetooth-enabled seatback screens. The partnership is aimed at elevating the traveling experience of UAL customers by offering Spotify's in-flight streaming services for free..3.  The Iran-Israel conflict has caused many airlines to suspend or cancel flights to parts of the Middle East. Joining the list, Delta has announced the suspension of its direct service between New York-JFK and Tel Aviv until at least Aug. 31, 2025, due to the deteriorating security situation in Israel and continues to monitor the region for any changes. Affected customers have been offered refunds or the option to rebook on alternate dates or routes. United Airlines, too, has suspended its Tel Aviv flights through July 31..4. Volaris reported a 9% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles). The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decreased 4.3 percentage points to 81.8% on a consolidated basis. The metric fell as the increase in consolidated traffic (3.5%) was less than the increase in consolidated capacity. During May, Volaris transported 2.5 million passengers, up 4.2% year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stock-roundup-dal-ual-150900694.html,"```json

Recent purchases by insiders .AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..To get a sense of who is truly in control of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)..Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$1.1b last week. However, the 0.7% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future..Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Delta Air Lines.. View our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines .Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing..We can see that Delta Air Lines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Delta Air Lines' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters..Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Delta Air Lines. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder..Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/0-7-one-returns-institutional-140021094.html,"```json

By 2 a.m. UTC this morning, nearly all commercial aircraft had been redirected..Israel’s main international airport, Ben Gurion Airport (TLV), which is located 12 miles southeast of Tel Aviv, was quickly closed, according to a report from the Times of Israel..According to a pop-up notice on the airport’s website, all flights to and from the airport are canceled until further notice..“Due to the current special security situation, all flights to and from Ben Gurion Airport (LLBG) are canceled until further notice,” the notice reads. “Please be advised: Do not travel to the airport.”.CNN reports that other airports in the region also remain closed, including Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport and Amman’s Queen Alia International Airport..While the conflict is in the Middle East, it has affected flights operated by U.S.-based airlines.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise..We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises..The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure..Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Delta Air Lines (DAL) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.10 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 10, 2025..DAL has an Earnings ESP figure of 9.29%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.10 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92..DAL is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Southwest Airlines (LUV) as well..Southwest Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 24, 2025. LUV's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.55 a share 41 days from its next earnings release..Southwest Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 5.26% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.52..DAL and LUV's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report..Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

( NYSE:DAL ) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may...","In the last year, many Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more..While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Glen Hauenstein, sold US$4.4m worth of shares at a price of US$58.30 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$48.88). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price..Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.0m for 25.00k shares. But they sold 348.27k shares for US$21m. In total, Delta Air Lines insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!. View our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines .If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar)..It's good to see that Delta Air Lines insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. In total, insiders bought US$601k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook..I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Delta Air Lines insiders own about US$126m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-delta-air-120028060.html,"```json

Growing loyalty programs, premium travel revenue, and co-brand credit card remuneration are diversifying Delta's revenue streams.  No one should be under any illusions that the air travel market isn't under some pressure right now.","Delta Air Lines will emerge as a stronger airline coming out of the recent slowdown..The current environment favors premium carriers like Delta over low-cost carriers..Growing loyalty programs, premium travel revenue, and co-brand credit card remuneration are diversifying Delta's revenue streams..10 stocks we like better than Delta Air Lines ›.No one should be under any illusions that the air travel market isn't under some pressure right now. It is. Still, the long-term case for investing in a higher-quality airline like Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) remains undiminished, and some of the forces that created the weakness are now strengthening the case for buying the stock. Here's why buying Delta stock can set you up for many years of profitable income..Unfortunately, the escalation in trade conflicts and tariff actions has had a negative effect on the travel market in 2025. CEO Ed Bastian noted on the last earnings call in April that ""given broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled"" with ""softness in both consumer and corporate travel"" in Delta's main cabin. As such, Delta's management elected not to update on its full-year guidance..While that's not a good sign, it's crucial to note Delta's and other airlines' reactions to events, as they help support the buy case for the stock. Simply put, Delta is planning to reduce its expected capacity growth in the second half to align supply with demand. United Airlines is also decreasing its international and domestic capacity relative to previous expectations in response to market conditions..The airline industry is demonstrating discipline in reducing capacity when and where it's necessary in response to changing demand conditions. That's something that hasn't always been a part of the industry's history. Instead, airlines have often maintained routes (partly due to high fixed costs) through slowdowns and, consequently, suffered the slings and arrows of margin degradation..However, the newfound discipline -- which, incidentally, was also in place last summer when overcapacity appeared -- is good news for the industry. It's particularly good news for the higher-quality airlines like Delta..One of the long-standing criticisms of the industry (also made by Buffett) is that it fails to generate the return on invested capital (ROIC) necessary to cover its cost of capital. It's a valid criticism, also made by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but not all airlines are equal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-buying-delta-air-lines-224100718.html,"```json

Capitalizing on increased travel demand following the pandemic, Copa has been able to sustain operating margins of more than 20%, making it one of the most profitable airlines globally..Notably, this trumps most Latin American airlines, including LATAM Airlines Group and many of its U.S. counterparts, with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines having the highest operating margins among domestic carriers at around 10-12%. Considering Copa’s outstanding operational performance, it's very appealing that the airline expects to boost its capacity by 7-8% this year..Correlating with such, Copa Holdings’ EPS is currently slated to spike 14% in fiscal 2025 to $16.64 per share. Plus, FY25 EPS estimates are up 6% in the last 60 days from projections of $15.60..Like Copa Holdings, Euroseas is highly profitable thanks to its efficient fleet management and strong market position, having operations out of Athens, Greece, for more than 130 years. This allows Euroseas to benefit from strong charter rates, which significantly boost revenue. Furthermore, Euroseas strategically manages its fleet, selling older vessels and acquiring newer, more efficient ships to optimize profitability..Speaking of such, Euroseas recently announced the sale of its 2005-built containership, M/V Marcos V, for $50 million. Euroseas’s bottom line is expected to dip 2% in FY25 to $14.50 per share, but EPS estimates are slightly up over the last week and have now risen 2% in the last 60 days..Largely suggesting more upside in Copa and Euroseas stock is that CPA and ESEA trade at just 6.4X and 2.8X forward earnings, respectively. Reassuringly, this also alludes to the notion that the risk-to-reward is still favorable even with CPA shares soaring over +20% year to date and ESEA up more than +15%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-090000666.html,"```json

This move could contribute positively to Delta's ongoing strategy of cost management and capacity alignment, potentially strengthening its net margins. Over the past five years, Delta's total return, combining share price appreciation and dividends, was 83.36%. Despite a decline in annual earnings growth of 26.9% last year, Delta outperformed historically, indicating resilience in its longer-term performance..Over the past year, Delta underperformed both the US Airlines industry and the broader market, achieving lower returns compared to industry and market averages of 15.5% and 11%, respectively. This underscores the need for Delta to effectively leverage upcoming opportunities, including improvements in premium services and strategic partnerships, which could bolster revenue streams such as international segments and MRO agreements with UPS. The recent financial measures may support earnings and revenue forecasts, aiming for earnings of US$4.6 billion and revenue of US$66.9 billion by May 2028..Delta's current share price stands at US$44.81, reflecting an overall increase amid recent positive developments. However, it still trades at a discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$56.60, suggesting further upside potential if Delta's strategic initiatives succeed.

61,2025-06-06 00:14:00,Alaska Air's Arm to Launch New Flights for Boosting Connectivity,The latest announcement places ALK as the first airline to provide nonstop service from Seattle to Rome.,"In a bid to broaden its network, Alaska Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (ALK), will start a new nonstop service between Seattle and Rome. The service will commence in May 2026. Tickets for the new nonstop route will be available at alaskaair.com and hawaiianairlines.com, starting in fall 2025..Flights on the Seattle–Rome route will be operated by Alaska Airlines through a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner..This announcement places Rome as the third widebody international route served out of Alaska's global gateway in Seattle after Tokyo Narita, which was launched on May 12, and Seoul Incheon, which will commence on Sept. 12..Notably, ALK is transforming Seattle into the West Coast's new premier global gateway while working on its ""Alaska Accelerate,"" a three-year strategic plan aimed at delivering $1 billion in incremental profit following the combination with Hawaiian Airlines. ALK’s hub at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) is already the largest airline hub on the West Coast, serving 104 nonstop destinations across North America and globally..Alaska Airlines’ chief executive officer, Ben Minicucci, stated, ""Serving Rome nonstop from Seattle is a dream come true. As an Italian American whose parents emigrated from Italy, this is a particularly meaningful addition to our network. Rome has been at the top of the list ever since we announced our new global gateway out of Seattle. Our guests have been asking for an easy way to get to Italy for years, and we're thrilled to provide it to people in the Northwest and beyond. Andiamo – let's go!"".While Rome remains one of the most-desired destinations for Mileage Plan members, it continues to be the largest crowd-pleasing European destination, which is not currently served nonstop from Seattle. As a result, the announcement of the new nonstop route seems to be a strategic business move on Alaska Airlines’ part to strengthen its competitive position in the airline industry..Additionally, this new nonstop option for Seattle guests will also provide improved one-stop connectivity for guests all along the West Coast and Hawaii..On a similar note, an expansion-related update from Delta Air Lines DAL was also available in the past week. In line with the efforts to strengthen its footprint in Spain, Delta launched a new nonstop flight from Boston to Barcelona. Flights on the new route will operate thrice a week. This route complements Delta’s existing services to Barcelona from New York-JFK (12 weekly flights) and Atlanta (10 weekly flights). Flights on the Boston–Barcelona route are being operated by DAL through a 281-seater Airbus A330-900neo, equipped with all modern facilities.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-airs-arm-launch-flights-161400633.html,"```json

62,2025-06-05 21:30:00,Is It Worth Investing in Delta (DAL) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,"Based on the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), Delta (DAL) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Delta Air Lines (DAL)..Delta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy, representing 90.9% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Delta here>>>The ABR suggests buying Delta, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-delta-dal-based-133009139.html,"```json

Delta is growing its premium ticket revenue as well as its co-brand credit card remuneration, helping diversify its revenue streams.  Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) stock rose by 16.2% in May, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.","Easing trade tensions encouraged investors to buy airline stocks in May..Delta is growing its premium ticket revenue as well as its co-brand credit card remuneration, helping diversify its revenue streams..10 stocks we like better than Delta Air Lines ›.Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) stock rose by 16.2% in May, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The move primarily results from the de-escalation of the tariff conflict, primarily between the U.S. and China in mid-May..Airlines are good bellwethers of the economy. When travelers (consumers or corporate) are feeling confident in growth prospects, bookings are high, revenue passenger miles are in growth mode, and load factors (the percentage of seating capacity filled by paying passengers) are also high. The opposite applies when the economy turns down, or there's a fear of a downturn ahead..Moreover, these responses to a changing environment tend to be relatively rapid; thus, when President Donald Trump initiated the current tariff dispute, it caused uncertainty among consumers and corporate travelers, leading Delta and other airlines to revise or withdraw their initial full-year guidance..Delta is a case in point, with management electing not to reaffirm its full-year guidance during the first-quarter earnings call. That's hardly surprising given that first-quarter revenue growth of 3.3% came in significantly lower than the estimate for 7% to 9% given in January..That said, just as analysts and investors will rush to pencil in lower estimates for earnings based on rising trade tensions and greater uncertainty in the economy, they will assume higher earnings when trade tensions ease, as they did with the joint announcement of a rolling back of previously announced tariffs, for 90 days, in mid-May..The de-escalation raised hopes of an amicable end to the conflict, or at the very least a cessation of escalatory actions..Outside of tariff uncertainty, there are several reasons to like Delta Air Lines' stock. The airline continues to grow its higher-margin premium revenue. The airline industry is acting in a more disciplined manner than in previous decades by reducing capacity when demand slows. Additionally, Delta's loyalty programs and co-branded credit cards are diversifying its revenue streams..Moreover, management plans to utilize Delta's cash flow to reduce its debt load and enhance its balance sheet in the coming years..While it's incredibly tough to predict what the tariff landscape will look like through 2025 and beyond, all parties are saying they would like to resolve the various conflicts that created them in the first place. That's a positive, and given its positive exposure to thawing in the dispute, and its underlying attractiveness as a stock, Delta is worth buying for investors who are confident that there will be a resolution to the conflict that doesn't end up impairing growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-delta-air-lines-stock-114910660.html,"```json

Now, with big jets and even bigger partners, IndiGo hopes to flip the script.","IndiGo is doubling its order of Airbus A350 wide body jets and entering a new partnership with Delta Air Lines, Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic — a move that signals the Indian carrier’s push into long-haul international markets..“We will continue to add one aircraft each and every week for pretty much the next decade,” said CEO Pieter Elbers at a press briefing in Delhi on the first day of the annual IATA industry conference..The airline, which last year received 58 aircraft from Airbus, signed a new memorandum of understanding to convert 30 of its 70 existing A350 purchase rights into firm orders. This brings IndiGo’s confirmed A350 wide body fleet to 60 aircraft, with the deliveries of the first 30 beginning in 2027..Last April, IndiGo placed its first-ever order for 30 A350 wide body aircraft with Airbus. The scale of the order cements IndiGo’s intent to challenge established players in the long-haul international market, a segment the low-cost carrier has largely avoided until now..To tide over a delivery gap, IndiGo has begun leasing six wide body Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft from Norwegian low-cost long-haul carrier Norse Atlantic Airways..The airline also announced an alliance with Delta, Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic..The agreement — subject to regulatory approval — creates a framework to integrate IndiGo’s domestic network with transatlantic and European routes, enabling seamless bookings, loyalty program ties, and coordinated flight schedules..“Linking dozens of cities in the United States, Canada, Europe and India, the airlines aim to meet rising demand for international travel,"" IndiGo said in a statement..The joint network would leverage IndiGo’s deep domestic penetration, Delta’s U.S. footprint, Air France-KLM’s European hubs, and Virgin Atlantic’s transatlantic links..Once implemented, IndiGo will sell international partner flights under its own 6E code, giving its customers access to more than 30 European cities via Amsterdam, as well as North America through Manchester and beyond..Virgin Atlantic’s chief Shai Weiss said the tie-up would link “four of the world’s largest economies."".The partnership lays the groundwork for deeper integration: joint sales and network planning, coordinated cargo operations, shared technology and sustainability initiatives, and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits..Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, described India as “a strategic market” and pointed to his group’s “strong and historic presence” in the country, one that is soon set to expand dramatically.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/indigo-global-bet-doubles-airbus-150448359.html,"```json

Quitting his job as an NFL consultant to make cocktail bitters and canned beverages, he now helms a multimillion-dollar operation and was even tapped by $64 billion alcohol giant Diageo for his expertise..Some people spend their entire workdays excited to go home and pursue their true passion. One Gen X entrepreneur quit his 9-to-5 with a dream—and now, he runs a business partnering with Disney and Delta Airlines..Jomaree Pinkard runs cocktail company Hella Cocktail Co. with his two best friends, Tobin Ludwig and Eddie Simeón. Launching the business in 2012 in New York City, the ragtag crew sought to ride the speakeasy and craft cocktail waves of the era with their own products: first with bitters, then with premium mixers and canned beverages. Now, Hella’s products are in over 20,000 restaurants, bars, airplanes, and retailers, bolstered by a $5 million deal with Uncle Nearest. The business budded from a pastime enjoyed by three friends who were just messing around and wanted to create a good artisanal product..“We were just doing a Kickstarter and a hobby. We were the kind of guys to make homemade pizza and cocktails,” Jomaree tells Fortune. “And so when we started this hobby with 2,500 bucks on a credit card, we weren’t set out on the journey.”.As the business brains of the group, 46-year-old Pinkard has largely been in charge of Hella’s partnerships and financial strategies. In the 13 years since, Hella Cocktail Co. has joined forces with billion-dollar brands; Pinkard himself brokered the company’s national partnerships with Southern Glazers’ Wine & Spirits, TGI Fridays, Disney, Whole Foods, and Delta Airlines. But it may never have happened if Pinkard didn’t quit his 9-to-5 to live out a dream with his two best friends..It’s safe to say that Hella Cocktail Co. was a slow burn; although the company launched in 2012, the three founders were juggling the business with their full-time jobs. At the time, Pinkard was a player engagement consultant for the NFL, Ludwig was a bartender in New York City, and Simeón worked at Martha Stewart’s media and merchandising company..It took between three and four years for the trio to actually quit their day jobs. Pinkard was in his early 30s by the time he turned to full-time entrepreneurship, after a Wharton education as well as stints at the NFL and Marsh & McLennan. It was a scary jump—but business was finally blooming at Hella Cocktail, and it felt more secure to fully commit. Two years later, the brand was partnering with Restoration Hardware and stocking the bar carts of Delta flights.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-x-entrepreneur-launched-multimillion-110200897.html,"```json

77,2025-05-28 20:19:00,Here's Why Investors Should Hold Onto Delta Air Lines Stock Now,"Robust customer & shareholder-friendly initiatives boost DAL's prospects. However, high operating costs are a major headwind.","Delta Air Lines’DAL top line is benefiting from its customer-friendly initiatives. The airline’s proactive measures to expand and upgrade its fleet are praiseworthy. However, DAL has been grappling with weak liquidity and increased operating expenses..Delta Air Lines’ expanded partnership with Italian fashion house Missoni brings elevated luxury and comfort to its Delta One premium cabin, focusing on enhancing the in-flight sleep experience. Launching this summer on international routes and rolling out fleetwide by year-end, the collaboration introduces a new Missoni-designed bedding set crafted to enhance comfort and style on long-haul flights. Later this year, Delta will launch upgraded amenity kits in collectible Missoni-designed bags with curated travel essentials. Such customer-focused initiatives are enhancing Delta’s brand appeal and strengthening its competitive edge in premium air travel..DAL's robust expansion measures are commendable, as it adds more than 52 nonstop routes across the region to cater to the rising demand for leisure travel to tropical destinations. By increasing flight options from key U.S. cities like Austin, Nashville, TN, and Raleigh-Durham, NC, to popular Caribbean and Latin American spots such as Cancun, Nassau and San Juan, Delta is significantly enhancing convenience for travelers. Expanded service from hubs like Detroit and Boston, including daily nonstop flights from Boston to St. Thomas during the holiday season, strengthens Delta’s position in the leisure travel market and offers customers greater flexibility and access to sun-soaked escapes..Delta’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders via dividends and buybacks is encouraging. In the first half of 2024, the airline announced a 50 percent increase in its quarterly dividend, beginning in the September quarter of 2024. This was the first dividend increase announced by DAL since its resumption of quarterly dividend payments last year following the COVID-19-induced hiatus. The new quarterly dividend has become 15 cents per share (annualized 60 cents per share)..High operating expenses are adversely impacting Delta Air Lines’ bottom line. This surge in operating expenses is driven by the increase in labor costs..In the first quarter of 2025, labor costs, comprising salaries and benefits (accounting for 30.3% of the total operating expenses), rose 8% year over year to $4.1 billion..Delta Air Lines exited the first quarter of 2025 with a current ratio (a measure of liquidity) of 0.38, raising liquidity concerns. A current ratio of less than 1 indicates that the company does not have enough cash to meet its short-term obligations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-hold-onto-121900607.html,"```json

We are just talking with Brett Ryan about that here with us on set. Can these airlines continue to rely on higher income consumers to prop up their profits in this macro environment? .Yes, so I think the answer is yes, certain airlines can still count on the high-end consumer to prop up earnings. It's going to be the big full service: United, Delta, and American. Uh look, there's a lot of competition I think for the uh for the base basic economy, uh probably even premium economy travelers. So I think there's probably too much capacity in the market uh for those that the number of uh those travelers that are in this space. And so I would expect some discounting to fill airplanes. So I think the more you're focused on just premium economy and basic economy as an airline, the more the more difficult it's going to be this summer for you to make money. .I'm curious, Josh, what about declining oil prices, that dynamic oil here at at 61. How how much of a tailwind is that for the industry? .Yeah, look it it helps, right? So, uh you know, I think we were doing some math on this, you know, recently and look, I mean, you know, uh fuel prices are uh 20 to 30% of an airline's cost basis. So, you know, if you if they're down 10% or something like that, you're going to save a couple points on cost, right, two percent of cost. It's just not a lot. I don't think you can uh cut fares enough given that extra wiggle room you got from fuel in order to make a large difference. It will help, but really what we're still seeing is an industry where in 2Q and 3Q, based on consensus, not even my numbers but based on consensus, uh expectations are for lower EBITDA, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and rent, which is typically how we measure, and lower margins, lower EBITDA margins. So not going to help enough. .Okay, so not going to help enough. What do you think moves the needle then? I know you sent over in your notes some areas where we could see airlines trying to be competitive when it comes to pricing. If they cut costs on, say, domestic flights, is that something that could be a little bit more impactful than lower oil? .Well, uh so I mean I think that's going to be what's driving the earnings number, right? Domestic business is the largest business for all airlines. Uh and I think the discounting they have to do in domestic to fill airplanes, because you just can't fly, you know, aircraft at 60 or 70% full, you'll never make money that way. So you got to discount them to get them up into the 80s plus percent. I think that discounting is what's going to hurt earnings. We still see international as being relatively strong for the summer season. I think really you get a pretty long booking curve for folks going international. So, uh you know, right now the the euro is sort of working against that traveler, but they didn't see that in the beginning of the year. And so I would still think demand is pretty robust across the Atlantic, at least for the first half of summer and that will be a nice support for earnings. I think we're going to see whether anybody's starting to change their mind on Europe. It's been very US point of sale. We'll see if everybody's starting to change their mind as we get into 3Q. My guess is you could find some. It may not be enough to to create a lot of softness to Europe. So I think that's still a strength this summer and that's what's part of the tailwind for United, American, and Delta.

With that in mind, this article will...","One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)..Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..The formula for return on equity is:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Delta Air Lines is:.24% = US$3.7b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025)..The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.24 in profit.. View our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines .One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Delta Air Lines has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Airlines industry..That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Delta Air Lines visit our risks dashboard for free..Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used..It's worth noting the high use of debt by Delta Air Lines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.05. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-inc-nyse-120016037.html,"```json

83,2025-05-21 19:00:00,Airlines brace for the summer of hell,Summer’s usually a boom time for airlines. This year could change that.,"Summer’s usually a boom time for airlines. This year could change that..Airlines began 2025 projecting strong growth. But since then, one issue after another has cut into passenger demand..Air traffic control problems are causing flight delays and cancellations, feeding into traveler worries over safety that began in January with the worst US air crash in decades. A global trade war and other economic concerns are driving down the value of the dollar, making overseas travel more expensive for Americans..Meanwhile, foreign travelers are staying away either in protest over actions by the Trump administration or due to immigration concerns. There are also new security rules requiring airlines passengers upgrade to a “Real ID” to get through TSA checkpoints, which could keep some passengers from flying..Add to that a general concern about the economy, and what’s usually a key money-making time for the airlines could fall short this year..“It really is a perfect storm of a lot of things affecting the airlines,” said William McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project think tank. “Summer is definitely going to be softer for the airlines. And summer is where the biggest part of the money is made.”.Instead of gearing up to make big profits, airlines are cutting back flight routes for the rest of the year to save money, stepping away from earlier optimistic earnings guidance. Airline stocks measured by the NYSE Arca Airline Index have lost more than 20% of their value since January 29, the date of the fatal crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport..That was the first high-profile airline incident this year, but it was far from the last. Since then, there has been a non-fatal crash in Toronto of a Delta regional jet as well as reports of near-collisions on the ground, and in the air, at various airports across the United States..After the fatal crash in Washington, DC, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline saw an immediate drop in ticket sales as more passengers became worried about flying..“It caused a lot of shock among consumers,” he said at an investors conference in March . “We saw a pretty immediate stall in both corporate travel and bookings. Consumer confidence and certainty in air travel started to wane a little bit as questions of safety came in.”.Concerns about safety haven’t been helped by recent reports of air traffic controllers overseeing flights at Newark Liberty International Airport briefly losing both radar and their ability to communicate with planes..There were no crashes as a result of the air traffic control issues, but it did cause some controllers to put in for trauma leave. The drop in staffing led to long delays and cancellations for thousands of flights at one of the nation’s key airport hubs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-brace-summer-hell-110052376.html,"```json

85,2025-05-20 22:20:00,DAL vs. LUV: Which Airline Stock is a Stronger Play Now?,Both DAL and LUV are being hit by tariff risks. Read on to know which company holds an edge now.,"Delta Air Lines DAL and Southwest Airlines LUV are two well-known names in the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry, accounting for a significant market share in the U.S. airline space..Delta, based in Atlanta, GA, is a founding member of the SkyTeam alliance. It is known for its extensive domestic and international network. DAL and its alliance partners collectively serve over 120 countries and territories, with more than 800 destinations served globally..On the other hand, Southwest Airlines is based in Dallas. Through its vast network, LUV served 117 destinations in 42 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, apart from countries like Mexico, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Aruba, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Belize, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos at 2024-end..Given this backdrop, let’s see which airline heavyweight currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now..Due to the tariff-induced economic uncertainties and the resultant reduction in consumer and corporate confidence, DAL withdrew its full-year 2025 outlook while releasing its first-quarter 2025 results last month. To combat the weak demand scenario, DAL is reducing costs by trimming capacity..Despite the tough conditions, the airline demonstrated resilience and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. This was the second earnings beat for the company in the last four quarters (having missed the mark in the other two quarters)..Delta Air Lines price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Delta Air Lines Quote.The recent positive updates on the tariff front are highly welcome for airline stocks like DAL. Recently, the United States and China announced a 90-day deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs. With DAL having a global presence, this sign of easing trade tensions is a huge positive. Moreover, the southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of Delta. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space..Highlighting its shareholder-friendly stance, DAL’s management resumed paying quarterly dividends in 2023 of 10 cents per share after a COVID-induced hiatus. In June 2024, management announced a 50% hike in its quarterly dividend payout. This was the first dividend increase by DAL since the resumption of its quarterly dividend payments. DAL’s dividend yield is currently in excess of 1%. In this scenario of uncertainty, DAL’s dividend-paying capacity is a positive for income-seeking investors. This highlights confidence in its cash flow and prospects.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dal-vs-luv-airline-stock-142000272.html,"```json

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Delta Air Lines’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..Great news for investors – Delta Air Lines is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that Delta Air Lines’s ratio of 9.08x is below its peer average of 11.44x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Airlines industry. However, given that Delta Air Lines’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.. See our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines .Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 27% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Delta Air Lines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation..Are you a shareholder? Since DAL is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-delta-air-lines-120022514.html,"```json

 .In a new report Thursday, on Bank of America's Industrials, Transportation & Airlines Conference, airline management teams focused on the sturdiness of booking trends, especially at the three legacy carriers, United (UAL), American (AAL), and Delta (DAL). They also noted the continued resilience in premium travel, with softness mostly in main cabin, reflecting similar comments the companies made during their earnings calls last month..Corporate travel growth is off the peak seen earlier in the year, according to the report, but is still positive. Despite it all..That meshes with accounts outside of the sector that appear to show business-as-usual consumption in some respects but cautious spending elsewhere. More affluent customers continue to shell out, whereas lower earners are pulling back. As Delta Air Lines management noted, the bulk of weakness has come from off-peak bookings in the main cabin..American Airlines and Southwest Airlines (LUV) both pulled their outlooks for 2025 when they reported last month, citing uncertainty that weighed on demand. Delta did the same. But since then, stability has taken hold, according to the report. At the conference, Frontier also noted that passenger demand has strengthened as consumer confidence improved, allowing the company to raise fares..Another report on Thursday by the Bank of America Institute showed further signs of spending weakness, as well as bifurcation..""Travel and tourism spending has gotten off to a slower start in 2025 than in the past few years,"" according to the report, which measured household card spending from the start of the year through the beginning of May. The data showed spending on airlines and lodging was notably weaker..One potential reason behind softer travel spending, economists Taylor Bowley and David Tinsley said, is the sharp drop in consumer sentiment this year — a key theme that has rattled Wall Street and fueled concerns of a deteriorating economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/an-unexpected-theme-is-coming-out-of-a-turbulent-sector-stability-100054909.html,"```json

Classic tickets will replace the current version of each tier, while the ""extra"" version takes the place of tickets that are currently fully refundable. The airline said those versions will provide ""greater choice and more customization."".The lowest category, Delta Main, will have a third tier called Delta Main Basic, which will replace Delta's basic economy package. Within the three tiers for Delta Main, the airline said, differences could also include boarding and upgrade priority and in how rewards miles are earned..“As we listen and learn about what our customers want when it comes to their travel, we know that clarity and choice are paramount,” Chief Digital Officer Eric Phillips said..The new products can be seen as of Thursday when looking at flights for Oct. 1 and later.

The carrier is renaming sections of the plane and will offer three levels of tickets in each. The changes go into effect for flights beginning Oct. 21..Booking a flight on Delta Air Lines this fall is going to take some re-education..The carrier on Thursday announced a refresh of its seating categories, which will let passengers choose options important to them, but could make it a little harder to find what they're used to at the same price..The changes will go into effect on Oct. 1 – though passengers booking a ticket and flying before then will still see the new seat product branding..“As we listen and learn about what our customers want when it comes to their travel, we know that clarity and choice are paramount,” said Eric Phillips, senior vice president and chief digital officer in a company blog post. “Our reimagined shopping experience gives customers more options and flexibility to pick the travel experience that works best for them, and a full picture of all the benefits of flying with Delta.”.Here's what you can expect from the new options:.Delta Main Cabin will now be called Delta Main..Delta Comfort+ is now simply Delta Comfort.Delta First Class has been shortened to Delta First.The Delta Premium Select and Delta One options will keep their current names.

That's where things get a little more complicated..Each of the three new categories will have subcategories passengers can choose from. For Delta Main, those options are:.Delta Main Basic – These are the seats that used to be covered in Basic Economy. Choosing this option means you won't be able to reserve a specific seat and will board last.

These tickets are also the most refundable and include same-day standby..Delta Comfort, Delta First, Delta Premium Select and Delta One will also offer tiered experiences, though only Classic and Extra (no Basic)..The multiple tiers to choose from will result in a wider degree of pricing.

In fact, international spending in the US is expected to decline $12.5 billion this year..Third Bridge global head of sector analysts Peter McNally joins Market Domination to break down what's ahead for major carriers and how they're adjusting capacity..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Airlines have been signaling caution with several pulling or revising their folio outlooks on macroeconomic uncertainty. International travel spending in the United States is expected to decline $12.5 billion in 2025. That's according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, adding on to demand worries. We know are these safety concerns, incidents in the past two weeks tied to air traffic control at Newark Airport has raised worries over the safety of flying. For more on what this all means for travel and major airlines, we have Third Bridge Global Head of Sector Analyst, Peter McNally here. Peter, it is good to see you as always. So start big picture, Peter, summer travel season, it's here. What's coming, Peter? What are your expectations? .Well, I mean, the expectations across the board have been lowered, but they're still okay. You know, these safety issues have come up in the past and they've tended to be short-lived. Uh, I'm not really sure, you know, how long the uh, the issues in Newark are are going to go on, but United has been pretty emphatic that uh, it is safe to fly. Um, you know, that said, the the underlying demand for the industry is pretty healthy. I think airlines have been proactive in managing their capacity. Uh, so pricing just, you know, remains pretty good. Um, there's not like too many seats out there putting downward pressure at this point from from what we can see, and I think people are gearing up for a good summer. .Well, talk to me about that because some of the sources I've talked to, Peter, have said the opposite. There are concerns about all of this trade war headlines hurting international travel, particularly to the United States, uh, which is obviously a potential headwind for some of these big airlines. Then you've also got the safety challenges and then if we can pull up our CPI numbers, you also have airline fairs coming down a touch. Which of those headwinds I just mentioned is the most concerning to you as we head into the summer? .Well, I I think that the international travel is more impactful, let's say to a British Airways or a Lufthansa than it is for a Delta or United. Though those concerns more for Europeans coming here than it is for Americans going going to Europe where like that's 80% roughly of Delta's, you know, clients or the US traveler heading overseas. Um, and there really hasn't been a slowdown from anything we've seen out of the result on that yet. Um, but it is it is something that uh that that we're watching. Now, fairs, you know, coming off a bit, they're they're manageable, you know, at this point. Uh, I would also add that uh fuel prices coming down do offer a little margin relief for, you know, for these airlines that they they can offer a little bit of a discount um at this point, but they but they are taking some of the planned capacity out of the market.

Selling at an average price of US$59.63, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold..Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares..We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free..The President, Glen Hauenstein, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.4m worth of shares at a price of US$58.30 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$52.99. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price..Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 25.00k shares worth US$1.0m. But they sold 348.27k shares for US$21m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Delta Air Lines than they bought, over the last year.

(Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar)..Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Delta Air Lines. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$601k worth of shares. This makes one think the business has some good points..For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Delta Air Lines insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$131m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-signal-delta-air-lines-120030699.html,"```json

After all, if institutional investors are backing a company, there has to be a good reason for it, right?.Things get interesting when the same stock ends up with a high short interest. Where some investors back the company to become successful, others bet on its downfall. This contradiction is often eagerly tracked by investors, as it can potentially lead to explosive moves to either side..Consider, for instance, a scenario where a stock with a high short interest and a high hedge fund holding starts going up. As everyone rushes to buy more of the already popular stock, short sellers rush to close their positions, triggering a strong bull rally..We decided to shortlist stocks that were the most likely candidates for such a rally. To come up with our list of 15 most crowded hedge fund stocks that are targeted by short sellers, we only considered stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion and a short interest of at least 3%.

102,2025-05-14 00:02:00,UAL Bets on Twelve for Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Is the Stock a Buy?,"UAL's environment-friendly approach is encouraging. High labor costs and tariff risks, however, represent major headwinds.","In line with its environment-friendly approach, United Airlines UAL recently announced an investment in Twelve, an innovative low-carbon fuels company. Twelve makes use of a process that is similar to photosynthesis to transform carbon dioxide and water into sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, using renewable energy..UAL’s investment in the maker of Power-to-Liquid fuels is part of the Chicago-based company’s Sustainable Flight Fund. The fund, designed to back new ideas that can make air travel cleaner, supports UAL’s goal of cutting aviation emissions by 90% by 2050..We remind investors that UAL launched the Sustainable Flight Fund in 2023, intending to make flying greener. The fund, backed by multiple major companies, has grown to more than $200 million currently. The fund’s main goal is to expedite the development and production of SAF. Instead of relying on carbon offsets, UAL aims to directly reduce emissions at the source by expanding SAF availability. The investment in Twelve may play a crucial role in helping the aviation industry transition to more sustainable operations, particularly because of the increasing pressure for greener travel options..However, does this move by UAL make the stock worth betting on? Let’s delve deeper to answer the question..The southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of United Airlines. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for aviation industry players. Crude oil is struggling in 2025, with prices sliding to multi-month lows. Tariff concerns, weakening consumer confidence, and production increase by OPEC+ have all resulted in this downward pressure. Expenses on aircraft fuel and related taxes declined 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, aiding UAL’s bottom line..UAL’s balance sheet further underscores its strength. Investor-friendly initiatives add another layer of appeal. In October, UAL announced a $1.5 billion share buyback plan, highlighting its pro-shareholder approach. This was the first buyback program announced by UAL since it suspended share repurchases during the COVID-19 pandemic. UAL repurchased shares worth $451 million through April 10..From a valuation perspective, UAL is trading at a discount compared with the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry, going by the forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio. The company has a Value Score of A.

This anticipated busy schedule is likely to attract significant traffic at AAL, in turn boosting its top line..Given this encouraging forecast, the question that naturally arises is how investors should approach AAL stock. Let us delve deeper..Over the past 30 days, shares of AAL have performed well, gaining 21.8%, above the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry’s 16.3% uptick and fellow airline player United Airlines’ UAL 19.7% gain in the same timeframe. Another airline heavyweight, Delta Air Lines DAL, has performed even better, gaining 26.9% in the past month..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The airline industry, of which AAL is an integral part, has been badly hit by trade tensions. Economic uncertainties and the resultant reduction in consumer and corporate confidence, which hurt domestic air travel demand, prevented airline stocks from gaining altitude..Against this backdrop, the signs of easing trade tensions are highly welcome. Recently, the United States and China announced a 90-day deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs. Last month, President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted that the 145% tariffs on Chinese goods could be reduced soon. Bessent believes that this is “unsustainable.” Trump is also exploring pauses on certain tariffs, particularly on auto imports and some consumer electronics..Bessent expects more ""clarity"" on tariffs in the months ahead. During Vice President JD Vance's visit to India last month, discussions included cooperation in technology, defense, and energy, with the White House noting “progress” on several fronts.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aal-gears-busy-summer-season-153000582.html,"{

AAL’s price target was lifted to $15 from $12, while DAL’s was increased to $61 from $56. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which remains under pressure due to its heavy domestic exposure and lack of premium offerings, saw its target raised modestly to $31 from $27..While domestic leisure demand showed signs of softening early in the year, “premium bookings, loyalty revenue (e.g. card spend), and international demand remained strong,” benefiting carriers with broader exposure beyond U.S. leisure travel, said Bernstein..Bernstein concluded the outlook remains “better but still not great,” though the firm sees “less macro concern and associated demand fallout” supporting a more constructive stance on the group..Related articles.Bernstein sees improved setup for U.S. airline stocks, raises targets.Trump’s Middle East trip a boon for NVIDIA.Peloton raised to Outperform at Macquarie following Q3 earnings",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bernstein-sees-improved-setup-u-142331343.html,"```json

We're watching Magnificent 7 stocks, Airlines, and Pharmaceuticals. First up, let's talk about that Magnificent 7 rallying after the US and China agreed to tariff reductions. The stocks are up nearly 20% from their April 8th low here. And there you're taking a look at Nvidia, Apple, and Tesla on your screen. Um, and then perhaps we can take a look at the rest of them as well here. Amazon, of course, was one that we did see ripping to the upside here pre-market. And here's kind of a piece of the negotiation and the deals that we are still waiting more details around and still will need to be negotiated out in full. But if you're looking back and trying to use the 2020 deal as a measuring post, there could potentially for these tech companies be major advances at least in intellectual property protections here, which as you think about how many of them are trying to either make sure that their products continue to remain available in China or the Asia Pacific region more broadly and what intellectual property protections they would like if they are putting products in that region, whether it be chips, whether it be smartphones, they all want to make sure that there's a crackdown on counterfeit goods, that there's improved protection for trade secrets, and then uh measurements against some of these forced technology transfers. And so if you were able to insulate that and offer them some of those protections, that could potentially be a boon on top of, yeah, Apple not having to, you know, charge US consumers as much because they would be hitting or hit with more tariffs to get their products from production in China into the US and vice versa. .Yeah, it's interesting off the back of Apple this morning soaring not only because it's going up alongside the rest of the market, but also because of that announcement on potential increased uh prices that is, according to the Wall Street Journal this morning, citing sources that Apple could be lifting iPhone prices, not tying it to tariffs though because they don't want to have that headline cross, but they're lifting prices uh because of tariff policy here. But interesting to see the entire basket moving up. Nvidia in particular interesting because we didn't get any headlines specific to export controls on chips specifically, but yet it's moving up alongside the broader basket, the mag 7s, currently on track to be in a bull market if it continues to move to the upside. .Only other thing I'll say here on the mag 7, Amazon perhaps could have been one of the biggest like WTF moments that happened for the White House to have to consider as part of the broader trade negotiations when it leaked out some action that eventually was refuted by Amazon in saying that or there was a report that said that they were going to list what the increase in prices was due to tariffs and the White House got pissed off by that. And so that could have been one of the other major moments in this broader kind of timeline that we've continued to track here. And ultimately, uh, interesting to see how Amazon, of course, a platform that really relies on some of those cheaper products being able to make their way into the e-commerce platform as well here. .Absolutely. Well, next up, let's look at Airlines, one of the biggest gainers this morning following the agreement between the US and China to temporarily lower tariffs, also coming after the US government announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to upgrade the nation's air traffic control system. Look at all these stocks moving up across the board. The interesting thing, Kevin Gordon from Charles Schwab pointed this out, he'll be on with us later, are services going to be a area where consumers still feel that they can spend going forward even if you kind of try to put the toothpaste back in the tube when it comes to tariffs. .This one's difficult because you think about the summer travel season and how many consumers are still trying to figure out how much they have the propensity to spend versus recent years. We've come out of the years of the revenge travel, even the bleisure travel demand. And so now you're looking at a consumer that is being extremely discretionary about some of the travel and experience economy that they buy into, whether that be in parks and resorts. And of course, Disney, they were able to actually come out and signal a little bit more of a brighter light on that in terms of some of the investments that they're making going forward. Um, but for all the airlines, they have been up in the air about what the guidance and the near term, I'm sorry, I had to do it. They have been up in the air about exactly how they can communicate to the street where there's confidence in their guidance versus where they just need to level set and bring down expectations in order for them to beat on some of those lower bars as well. .Absolutely. .Finally here, let's talk a little pharma stocks following as President Trump vows to cut drug prices by more than 50%. Trump says he will institute a policy known as most favored nation where the US government plans to pay prices for drugs that are tied to the prices paid by other countries. You're seeing shares of some of the largest uh healthcare stocks here moving to the downside actually right now. What this would essentially mean is that they're not going to be able to extract as much in some of those margins or charge higher prices that then buoy those margins as well. .Absolutely. And there's obviously criticism about the US pharma companies being able to do a lot of the R&D that allows for uh some of that drug development to be a lift to these stocks. And in part, that's something the president will be addressing. He'll be speaking coming up here at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. We may have more headlines on those pharmaceutical stocks coming out of those remarks. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mag-7-rally-airline-pharmaceutical-140147890.html,"```json

108,2025-05-12 15:00:00,"People skills drive experience wins for Southwest, JetBlue, research finds","JetBlue and Delta have invested tens of millions of dollars training staff to be friendly and interactive, while Southwest hires for attitude.","This story was originally published on CX Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CX Dive newsletter. .Airline customers who fly economy report the most satisfaction with Southwest Airlines than any other major North American airline, according to a J.D. Power report released last week. J.D. Power surveyed over 10,200 passengers between March 2024 and March 2025..JetBlue Airlines led satisfaction among first-class and business customers, while Delta Air Lines led among customers who fly premium economy..People skills is a common denominator among these three airlines, according to Michael Taylor, senior managing director of travel, hospitality, retail and customer service at J.D. Power. “One of the bigger swing factors post pandemic has been people skills at these airlines,” Taylor told CX Dive..Airline staff are crucial to providing customers with a satisfying experience..“Really this comes down to: How can your airline make people feel like you value them?” Taylor said. “And you can't do that with the aircraft, necessarily. You do that with people.”.Southwest Airlines has long hired for attitude, Taylor said. The airline lets staff’s personalities show through..“They have personable people that go off script and tell jokes and so does the pilot,” Taylor said. “They make you feel like, ‘Oh, these are real people, not just automatons.’”.JetBlue and Delta, on the other hand, have invested “tens of millions of dollars” training people to be friendly and interactive, according to Taylor..Delta uses technology to interact with passengers. Flight attendants will use handhelds to drill down into the details of a customer in any seat, including name, history, complaints made in the past, and any kind of special requests made on prior flights. Delta then asks flight attendants to interact with a handful of passengers on every trip..This kind of interaction boosts satisfaction. Across the economy and basic economy segment, positive experiences with staff grew customer satisfaction by about 1% on J.D. Power’s 1,000-point scale, according to the report. But certain interactions — like using a first name — can account for as much as 5%..“People get kind of drunk on their first name,” Taylor said. “In our data, we asked various things that happened in the flight. If you get a free alcoholic drink, it's worth about 50 satisfaction points. Someone from the airline uses your first name: 49 points. You being called your first name by a flight attendant is like taking a shot of whiskey.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-skills-drive-experience-wins-070000696.html,"{

We take a look at earnings estimates for some clues.,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Delta Air Lines (DAL). Shares have added about 23.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500..Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Delta due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts..It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month..The consensus estimate has shifted -22.88% due to these changes..Currently, Delta has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

The administration is urging Congress to approve billions in funding to replace aging radar and other equipment and overhaul the tech infrastructure..Speaking elsewhere on Thursday, President Donald Trump said the government is ""now in the market to buy a gorgeous brand new system"" to handle air traffic control..Though the changes cannot be implemented overnight, a change in the narrative away from focusing on the issues and toward fixing them could help boost demand for air travel..Unfortunately for the industry, airline investors have a lot more to worry about than just air traffic control modernization. This is a highly cyclical industry that is tied closely to the health of the consumer. When times are tough, households and businesses are more likely to cut back on travel than on paying for basic essentials..On earnings calls this quarter, execs largely said that demand is holding up for now but could come under pressure if tariffs and inflation sustain into the summer. With that in mind, the stocks are also likely moving on progress on the trade war front..Those considering buying in now should pay close attention to demand trends in the weeks and months to come.

Additionally, a direct summer service from New York–JFK to Copenhagen and JFK to Stockholm will start on April 14.  These flights will operate daily. Moreover, out of the 35 additional destinations, six are in Denmark, 14 are in Norway and 15 in Sweden..The move to expand in Scandinavia is a prudent one by Delta because demand for long-haul travel remains buoyant, even in the tariff-induced uncertain scenario. In the first quarter of 2025, DAL’s international revenues were up 7% year over year. Given this move, the question that naturally arises is how investors should approach DAL stock. Let us delve deeper..Over the past 30 days, shares of Delta have performed well, gaining 24.9%, above the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry’s 23.1% uptick and fellow airline player American Airlines’ AAL 15% gain in the same timeframe. Another airline heavyweight, United Airlines UAL, has performed even better, gaining 30.9% in the past month..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The airline industry, of which DAL is an integral part, has been badly hit by trade tensions. Economic uncertainties and the resultant reduction in consumer and corporate confidence, which hurt domestic air travel demand, prevented airline stocks from gaining altitude..Against this backdrop, the signs of easing trade tensions, which emanated from late last month, are highly welcome. President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted that the 145% tariffs on Chinese goods could be reduced soon. Bessent believes that the current scenario is “unsustainable.” Trump is also exploring pauses on certain tariffs, particularly on auto imports and some consumer electronics..Bessent struck an optimistic tone during a private investor summit last month, suggesting that the current state of U.S.-China tariffs is not viable in the long term. He expects more ""clarity"" on tariffs in the months ahead. During Vice President JD Vance's visit to India last month, discussions included cooperation in technology, defense, and energy, with the White House noting “progress” on several fronts.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/play-dal-stock-post-scandinavian-161700728.html,"```json

Make sure you've got the right ID to travel. Starting May 7th, every air traveler over the age of 18 will need a real ID to pass through security checkpoints. Yeah, I know what you're asking. What the heck is a real ID? Well, a real ID is a federally compliant DMV issued driver's license, learner's permit or state ID required for all domestic flights. A real ID compliant license has a star symbol in the upper right corner. Now, if you're not sure if your license or ID qualifies, check with your state's DMV. If it does not, you'll need to get a new one. And it could take weeks for the hard copy to arrive. The Department of Homeland Security warns that paper or temporary IDs may not be accepted by the TSA. So, make sure your identification is in order before you travel. If your driver's license isn't real ID compliant, don't panic. Other accepted forms of ID include a passport, a permanent resident card, an enhanced driver's license, or a border crossing card. For a full list of acceptable IDs, head to the TSA website and travelers who don't have a real ID or another approved form of identification, they may face delays, additional screening, or may not be allowed through security at all.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against unknown billionaire Phill Gross’ other stock picks with huge upside potential..Phillip “Phill” Gross is a seasoned investor and influential figure in the world of institutional asset management, best known as the Co-founder, Managing Director, and Healthcare Portfolio Manager of Adage Capital Management. While Robert Atchinson, his longtime collaborator and fellow Co-founder, serves as the firm’s Portfolio Manager, Gross’s leadership and strategic vision have played a foundational role in shaping Adage’s long-term investment philosophy and reputation. The two met in the mid-1980s while working as Harvard University’s endowment analysts. Their professional synergy led them to leave Harvard Management Company in the 1990s, following public scrutiny over performance-based bonuses. With the backing of an initial $1.8 billion investment from Harvard and an agreement for the university to receive 10% of the firm’s earnings, they launched Adage Capital Management in 2001 alongside an 18-person team..Under Gross’s co-leadership, Adage has become a key player in managing assets for prominent institutional clients such as Harvard University, Dartmouth College, Northwestern University, the American Red Cross, and the Getty Foundation. The firm specializes in long/short equity strategies guided by fundamental analysis and engages in risk arbitrage and event-driven opportunities when market conditions are favourable. Adage Capital Management and its predecessor, the Select Equity Group at Harvard Management Company, have consistently outperformed broader market benchmarks by an average of 3.5% over the past 15 years. This is a testament to the disciplined, research-driven investment framework that Gross helped instill..Gross himself brings a deep background in healthcare investing, having served for nearly two decades at Harvard Management Company in various roles, including Healthcare and Retail Analyst, Equity Research Director, and Partner. His academic credentials include a B.S. in finance and economics (1982) and an M.S. in investments (1983), both from the University of Wisconsin. He remains actively engaged with his alma mater, serving on the advisory boards of the Steve Hawk Center for Applied Securities Analysis and the Nicholas Center for Applied Corporate Finance. In recognition of his professional accomplishments and ongoing contributions, Gross received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Wisconsin Business School in 2006.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-dal-among-215343387.html,"```json

With a demo flight scheduled for 2027, the Z4 targets long-haul commercial routes but also offers military potential, according to the company. The aircraft has multiple configurations including cargo transport and refueling tankers, two use cases that account for around 60% of the U.S. Air Force's total jet fuel consumption..Don't Miss:.Inspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share!.Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now..The Air Force's $235 million contract is meant to accelerate the development of JetZero's demonstrator aircraft and airframe technologies. JetZero is working closely with the Air Force, NASA, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which places it at the intersection of federal defense, aviation research, and commercial innovation..In addition to military support, JetZero's commercial ambitions are gaining serious momentum, with United entering into a conditional agreement to order up to 100 aircraft, along with an option for 100 more..Besides the focus on fuel savings, the aircraft's blended wing structure introduces a completely reimagined cabin layout. The company said that plans for the interior include larger, flexible seating, wider aisles, handicap-accessible lavatories, and dedicated overhead bins for each seat. The design also streamlines boarding, thanks to a wide main entrance and multiple aisles, reducing crowding and speeding up passenger flow..The aircraft will run on conventional jet engines but is also compatible with sustainable aviation fuel blends.

I remember asking a man in Helsinki why his country is often ranked as the happiest on earth, at which point he leaned in and said, “it depends on how you define ‘happy.’” Good point. What makes for a happy employee at a hedge fund may be different than what motivates workers at a hospital or a hotel company. There are standard good practices like respect, fair pay, interesting work, and a sense of community, of course. But I long ago concluded that the most important factor in fostering happiness on the job is leadership. Inspiring leaders create inspiring places to work, as we’ve seen in the annual Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list..I had a chance to speak earlier this week with two leaders whose companies repeatedly appear on our list: Accenture Chair and CEO Julie Sweet and Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian. They joined me for a webinar alongside Great Place to Work CEO Michael C. Bush, our partner in putting together the ranking, which is culled from 1.3 million employee responses..Our conversation focused on how they are leading and managing change in these volatile times. “I was joking with a colleague that I redefined what R and R is to be resilience and results, because that's what I feel like I'm focusing on,” said Sweet, whose transparency about dealing with cancer has personally inspired me. “We can only control what we can control.” Among other things, she is now using her daily walks as a time to connect with people in her life. She’s also doubling down on the learning culture she’s fostered at the top, from reading Hope, an autobiography by the late Pope Francis, to regular check-ins with Accenture’s AI-enabled database on tariffs. “Being able to invest in being fast really matters to your employees as they're going through these difficult times.”.Bastian, meanwhile, is drawing lessons from the pandemic. “Rather than R and R. I've called it D and D: differentiated and durable.” What that means in practice is focusing first on employees, most of whom just got a 4% raise despite the economic uncertainty ahead. “The most important people to listen to are your own, to understand what they need to be able to take care of the hundreds of millions of people that we serve,” he said, adding that “At times like this is when we need leadership to stand up like never before.” (If you haven’t read Shawn Tully’s cover profile of Bastian in our current issue, you should.)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceos-accenture-delta-deal-fear-085713653.html,"```json

130,2025-05-01 18:55:00,Prediction: Delta Air Lines Stock Will Soar Over the Next Few Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.,"Premium, loyalty, and co-branded credit card revenue have diversified Delta's income streams.  Diversifying revenue streams makes the airline business more resilient during downturns.  It's no secret that President Donald Trump's trade war is negatively impacting airlines, at least in the near term, but that shouldn't detract from how attractive stocks like Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) are over the long term.","The airline industry has become much more disciplined about reducing capacity where and when it's necessary..Premium, loyalty, and co-branded credit card revenue have diversified Delta's income streams..Diversifying revenue streams makes the airline business more resilient during downturns..It's no secret that President Donald Trump's trade war is negatively impacting airlines, at least in the near term, but that shouldn't detract from how attractive stocks like Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) are over the long term..The key reason for this, and why this stock in particular could appreciate substantially in the coming years, comes down to one word: resiliency..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Running an airline is a cyclical business; it always has been and always will be. When the economy is booming, leisure travelers and businesses feel comfortable spending on airline tickets, but when growth slows, they pull back. Moreover, the industry was traditionally susceptible to changes in demand, as airlines have stubbornly stuck to their routes and flight volumes as they waited for the next upturn to arrive..However, they are much more disciplined now, and respond to dips in demand and periods of overcapacity by reducing unnecessary routes and flights, as witnessed last year when there was overcapacity during the summer..In that vein, Delta and its most similar peer, United Airlines, have already said they are paring back their capacity growth plans for 2025 in response to the slowdown in travel caused by tariff-related uncertainty and the trade war..This reflects an industry less financially sensitive to changes in demand, thanks to its agility in responding to supply-side changes..Airlines like Delta and United have also taken giant steps to diversify their revenue streams beyond main cabin flight options. Those efforts have paid off, as Delta's first-quarter earnings show; while main cabin passenger revenue declined 1% year over year, to $5.4 billion, its premium products revenue rose 7% to $4.7 billion. Its loyalty-related revenue rose 11% to $940 million, indicating the strength of its SkyMiles program and the appeal of its co-branded credit cards with American Express..While the environment could worsen and demand on its routes could slide further, Delta has demonstrated its resiliency and adaptability, which should reduce its downside risk. Meanwhile, its valuation suggests plenty of long-term upside for the stock.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-delta-air-lines-stock-105500303.html,"```json

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against other most undervalued stocks..Big tech stocks just suffered a massive hit, with the Magnificent Seven shedding a combined $1.8 trillion in market value over two brutal trading days at the beginning of April 2025. The iPhone-maker was hit the hardest, dropping more than $533 billion, partly due to new tariffs targeting its overseas production. Elon Musk’s EV giant fell over 10% on April 4, and Wall Street’s semiconductor darling lost nearly $400 billion. Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce powerhouse also saw its worst losing streak since 2008. The selloff came after Donald Trump’s newly announced tariffs sparked fears of a global trade war and potential recession. It did not just impact the mega-caps; the pain spread across the tech sector, which saw steep declines in stock prices. Even semiconductor stocks, although not yet directly impacted by tariffs, are being dragged down by growing uncertainty..Amidst this volatile market landscape, Veteran investor Bill Nygren noted that the chaos caused by Trump’s steep tariffs has opened up a rare window for long-term investors to scoop up undervalued stocks. While he admits the uncertainty is not great for investors and could lead to inflation and slower growth, he sees opportunity in the selloff. Nygren pointed out that many quality companies, including major airlines, banks, and media firms, are now trading at dirt-cheap valuations. Some of them are trading under 7 or 8 times earnings because of overly negative investor sentiment. Nygren believes that if you hold these types of stocks long enough, there is a good chance they will deliver solid returns..Hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett also endorses Bill Nygren’s approach. Buffett made his $165 billion fortune by practicing value investing. He is known for buying stocks that are undervalued compared to their true worth and holding onto them for the long run. His approach focuses on companies with robust fundamentals, solid management, and potential for future growth, rather than chasing after risky or short-term trends. Value investing involves looking for stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, and it often requires investors to go against the market's emotions and short-term movements..An aerial view of a commercial aircraft taking off from a coastal hub..For this article, we used the Finviz screener and filtered out S&P stocks.

They claim their hardware costs were around $6 million versus $80 to $100 million for their enormous American competitors.”.READ ALSO: Did Jim Cramer Nail All These 9 Stock Predictions? and What Happened After Jim Cramer Talked About These 13 Stocks..The announcement sent shockwaves through the market. Cramer recalled how NVIDIA saw its stock fall sharply over just two trading sessions. The market reaction spread quickly beyond and hit other companies tied to data center infrastructure, which eventually pulled down the broader Nasdaq. However, Cramer noted that the company then revealed plans to build $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years..Cramer noted that initially, it seemed to signal a renewed sense of stability. But soon after, the administration imposed a ban on selling AI chips to China, which forced the GPU kingpin to write down $5.5 billion tied to that entire initiative. Even so, Cramer emphasized that the company’s core business remained strong..“We understand that they’re basically sold out for the year, even as they can only sell their best stuff in the United States and the 18 friendly countries.”.Cramer attributed the export restrictions to a policy from former President Biden, one that President Trump has not reversed. Despite the geopolitical constraints, Cramer stressed that demand for the company’s technology is still overwhelming. He argued that the stock never should have experienced such a steep drop in the first place. He added:.“Even with the trade war, the AI infrastructure theme seems totally back on track. In fact, it never left the track to begin with.”.For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on April 30, 2024.

134,2025-04-30 22:48:00,DAL vs. UAL: Which Airline Stock is a Stronger Play Now?,"Amid the tariff-induced decline in domestic air travel demand, let's see which heavyweight, DAL or UAL, is a better pick now.","Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines UAL  are two well-known names in the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry. These airline heavyweights, along with American Airlines AAL and Southwest Airlines LUV, account for a vast majority of the U.S. airline market..Delta, based in Atlanta, GA, is a founding member of the SkyTeam alliance. It is known for its extensive domestic and international network. DAL and its alliance partners collectively serve over 120 countries and territories, with more than 800 destinations served globally..United Airlines, on the other hand, is based in Chicago and is a founding member of the world's largest alliance network, Star Alliance. Like DAL, UAL operates both domestically and internationally. Through its vast network, UAL is responsible for connecting around 174 million passengers to more than 360 destinations across six continents..Given this backdrop, let’s examine closely to find out which airline heavyweight currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now..Due to the tariff-induced economic uncertainties and the resultant reduction in consumer and corporate confidence, there has been a slowdown in domestic air travel demand, hurting U.S. airline operators like DAL.Given the lack of visibility, DAL withdrew its full-year 2025 outlook. Management stated that it would provide an update later in the year as visibility improves. To combat the weak demand scenario, DAL is reducing costs by trimming capacity. DAL now expects planned capacity to be flat in the second half of 2025 compared with 3-4% year-over-year growth expected previously, with domestic main cabin seats on the decline. As a result of this turbulent scenario, it is not much of a surprise that DAL expects adjusted revenues for the June quarter to be down 2% to up 2% from the prior year. Despite this chaotic situation, there are some positives for DAL. The southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of Delta. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. Crude oil is struggling in 2025, with prices sliding to multi-month lows. Tariff concerns, weakening consumer confidence, and production increases by OPEC+ have all resulted in this downward pressure. Consequently, expenses on aircraft fuel and related taxes declined 7% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, aiding DAL’s bottom line..Highlighting its shareholder-friendly stance, DAL’s management resumed paying quarterly dividends in 2023 of 10 cents per share after a COVID-induced hiatus. In June 2024, management announced a 50% hike in its quarterly dividend payout. This was the first dividend increase by DAL since the resumption of its quarterly dividend payments last year. DAL’s dividend yield is currently pegged at 1.43%. In this scenario of uncertainty, DAL’s dividend-paying capacity is a positive for income-seeking investors and highlights confidence in its cash flow and prospects.Delta’s liquidity position is encouraging. The airline ended first-quarter 2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, higher than the current debt level of $2.9 billion. This implies that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. DAL's efforts to repay its debts are encouraging, too. The company’s times interest earned ratio of 7.7 compares favorably with the industrial levels.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dal-vs-ual-airline-stock-144800892.html,"```json

Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate despite the tariff-induced uncertainty..The narrower-than-expected loss meant that AAL maintained its earnings surprise record, having surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters..American Airlines price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Quote.AAL expects earnings per share to be between 50 cents and $1 in the second quarter of 2025. However, given this uncertain scenario, AAL decided against giving guidance for a longer period and withdrew its 2025 financial guidance. Management stated that it would provide an update later in the year as visibility improves..With air travel demand on the domestic front slowing down, led by the tariff-induced weakening of consumer confidence, AAL is not the only player in the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry to withdraw its full-year guidance. Delta Air Lines DAL, while kicking off the first-quarter 2025 earnings season on April 9, had also withdrawn its outlook for 2025 due to the uncertainty. Southwest Airlines LUV, which, like AAL, reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on April 24, also did not reaffirm its guidance for earnings before interest and taxes for 2025 and 2026. Southwest Airlines’ management stated that “Amid the current macroeconomic uncertainty, it is difficult to forecast given recent and short-lived booking trends.”.(See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.).In the first quarter of 2025, AAL’s operating revenues decreased 0.2% year over year to $12.55 billion. Passenger revenues, accounting for 90.8% of the top line, decreased 0.6% year over year to $11.4 billion..Apart from the well-documented tariff-induced slowdown in domestic air travel demand, results were also hurt by the American Eagle flight 5342 mishap.

Is this the right time to buy the top-ranked airline ETF?,"The airline industry is facing growing turbulence as the ongoing global trade war creates a cloud of uncertainty over passenger demand and revenue projections. This week, Southwest Airlines LUV, American Airlines AAL and Alaska Air Group ALK withdrew their full-year 2025 guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and demand softness, signaling rougher skies ahead for investors.Amid the gloom, the U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, which tracks major airline stocks, is down 2.3% over the past week and 27.4% since the start of the year..All three airlines pointed to a slowdown in domestic leisure travel, which is historically one of the sector’s most stable pillars. Southwest Airlines stated that bookings weakened throughout the first quarter. Alaska projected a 6-point hit to second-quarter revenues due to reduced demand. Meanwhile, American Airlines gave a modest second-quarter earnings forecast of 50 cents-$1.00, significantly below consensus estimates.Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines UAL also signaled caution. Delta dropped its forecast earlier in April and United Airlines went a step further by offering two distinct profit scenarios — one assuming continued stability and another preparing for potential recessionary conditions. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the company would not expand flying in the second half of the year due to disappointing bookings amid Trump’s unpredictable trade policies, citing weaker-than-expected corporate and leisure travel demand..U.S. Global Jets ETF provides exposure to the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world, by tracking the U.S. Global Jets Index.

It charges investors 60 bps in annual fees (read: 5 Top-Ranked ETFs Under $20 to Buy Now)..Airlines are facing twin attacks from falling domestic and international travel due to a potential slowdown in the economy triggered by the Trump administration's aggressive and unpredictable tariff policy. International arrivals to the United States have declined sharply this year, with the biggest drops reported among western European, Central American and Caribbean travelers.

March was particularly negative, with an 11.6% drop compared to the same month last year. Stricter immigration controls and new trade policies introduced by the Trump administration may be deterring potential tourists, according to Stefan Gössling, a professor at the School of Business and Economics at Linnaeus University in Sweden.The travel forecasting company Tourism Economics, which, in December, anticipated that the United States would have nearly 9% more international arrivals this year, recently revised its annual outlook to predict a 9.4% decline (read: 5 Beaten-Down ETFs to Play on Hints of Trade De-escalation).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/travel-slump-hits-airlines-buy-153000557.html,"```json

He outlines four tips for people looking to travel this summer. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.","Going founder and chief flight expert, Scott Keyes, joins Wealth with Brad Smith to take a closer look at airline trends amid economic uncertainty. He outlines four tips for people looking to travel this summer..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here..American Airlines joining Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines and withdrawing full-year guidance amid heightened economic uncertainty. Americans domestic travel demand under pressure in the first quarter, while Southwest announced it will reduce its capacity in the second half of the year, pointing to that softer domestic demand. Here with more on travel demand, we've got Scott Keys, who is the founder and chief flight expert at Going, formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights. Great to have you here with us. So, just take us into your analysis of what we've heard from the airlines and what that spells for the summer travel season now that we're past most of everybody's spring break travels. .Sure. Look, airlines, like much of the rest of the economy right now, are flying blind, and when you're a pilot, when you're an airline, you do not want to be in that position. You've seen so many different airlines pulling their guidance, not just the ones you mentioned, also Alaska Airlines as well, and United coming out with two different forms of guidance depending on what type of macroeconomic environment we find ourselves in. So they're in a difficult position right now because while the bottom hasn't fallen out and travel today, what they're worried about is will it really start to soften in the upcoming months, especially in those summer months that are such a cash cow for the airlines that are essentially the airlines Black Friday. So there's fears in the travel industry of what this period of economic anxiety and uncertainty could mean for the discretionary spending category of travel. .And so with that, how are we anticipating that consumers will either pull back on some of that spending and ultimately, what type of destinations might receive the most demand as consumers are also trying to figure out, okay, where can we continue to spend into that travel experience versus where should we moderate or trade down some of that travel experience? .I think you're going to see a lot more trading down this time versus previous recessions, but it might look different than previous recessions. So, think back to 07-08. Some of the big winners in that ones were the budget airlines. Think Spirit Frontier that have all had years long expansions at that point and continued to. But nowadays, it's the budget airlines that are in real trouble, and it's the full-service airlines like Delta and United that come in from a position of strength. So while they might be seeing fewer of their business class and premium seats being sold, I think you're going to see a lot of those folks, like you said, trading down to economy or economy plus on the full-service airlines. And in fact, it's the budget airlines that have seen the biggest hit over the past month. Frontier Airlines stock down nearly 50% in the past month. Just a remarkable drop, and I think that speaks to a different landscape than we've seen historically. But in terms of destinations, you know, look, you've seen such a talking point of the drop in foreign arrivals to the United States, whether because of tight finances or because of folks getting detained at the border, or just nationalist sentiment with the trade war, and that means many fewer empty seats on flights to and from Europe, to and from Canada, which what do airlines do when they have those empty seats? They cut the price. You know, we've seen record lows on flights like, for instance, right now in the summer, Atlanta to Vancouver for $129 round trip. That's something that would usually cost over $500. Flights from Minneapolis over to Iceland for $460 nonstop round trip. Dallas to Amsterdam under $600 nonstop round trip in all in the summertime. Those are deals that really kind of underscore a softening in travel that the airlines are seeing. .And so, all of these in mind, I want to get to some of the tips here for flyers, passengers, travelers who are still trying to get the best bang for their buck for their summer travel season. .Couple things that you can do. First, target the beginning and the end of summer as the cheapest dates to fly. So, first two weeks of June, but especially the last two weeks of August. That's when you're most likely to see great deals popping up, and when you can see prices 30, 40% lower than that middle of summer period. Second, you know, getting the timing of your booking right is so important to getting a cheap flight. Right now is when we're at the end of what I would call the typical Goldilocks window period for when you're most likely to see cheap summer flights. This is not a typical year. I think we're much more likely to see last-minute fair drops than we have in years prior, given the kind of economic landscape that we find ourselves in. And then finally, if you are sitting on a stash of frequent flyer miles, expect to be able to use those for great value this summer. Not only are they usually at their best value for those last minute flights, but again, with many more unsold seats coming into this summer, that's those are the seats that airlines typically release to award availability in the final weeks before a flight. If you can hold out, you're really, really good odds this year of get being able to get great value for those miles. .Scott, I only got about 30 seconds left here. On the international travel front, how should travelers prepare for the reality of exchange rates with the weakening dollar as of right now? .Yeah, look, the dollars go, you know, it's down anywhere from 5 to 15% over the past few weeks, still a lot higher than it was, you know, even a decade ago. For folks who are traveling to Europe or Japan, expect things to be cheaper than you were there last time, even if it's a bit more expensive than it was a month or two ago. .Scott, great to have this conversation. Thanks so much for joining us and bringing us some very valuable tips for our summer travel plans. Appreciate it. .My pleasure. Thanks, Brad.

American Airlines pulled its financial guidance for 2025 on Thursday, joining rivals Southwest and Delta in declaring the economic outlook too uncertain to provide full-year forecasts.  “We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January, and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC.","Major U.S. airlines are reducing their flight schedules and revising or withdrawing their profit outlooks for the year due to less domestic travel demand as sentiment about the national and global economies sours..American Airlines pulled its financial guidance for 2025 on Thursday, joining rivals Southwest and Delta in declaring the economic outlook too uncertain to provide full-year forecasts. All three airlines cited weakening sales among economy class leisure travelers..“We came off a strong fourth quarter, saw decent business in January, and really domestic leisure travel fell off considerably as we went into the February time frame,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC..Consumer reluctance to book vacations would correspond with a new poll that showed many people fear the U.S. is being steered into a recession and that President Donald Trump's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise..There's also increasing concerns about international travelers. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said in a client note that anti-American sentiment could be spurring a travel dropoff, with data showing that international visitors to the U.S. are running about 5% lower than a year ago..“In recent weeks there have been numerous news stories about tourists canceling trips to the U.S. in protest of the perceived heavy-handedness of recent trade policies,” he wrote. “This points to potentially another channel to consider in assessing the effects of tariffs on economic activity.”.Some economic indicators point to expectations of a slowdown. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes slowed in March, and U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in April, the fourth consecutive month of declines. However, fears of a downturn have not translated into layoffs..Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in financial markets and generated recession fears, leading consumers and businesses to start pulling back on spending, which includes travel. The president put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes but increased his already steep tariffs against China..Beijing increased its import tax on American goods to 125% in retaliation. On Thursday China denied Trump’s assertion that the two sides were involved in active negotiations to end or mitigate their trade war..American Airlines said it would give an update on its full-year guidance “as the economic outlook becomes clearer.” Airline executives said sales among business travelers and for premium seats on long-haul international flights remained solid.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-rattled-trade-war-spending-150717136.html,"```json

Um I think if negotiations were to occur tomorrow, um I'm not so sure it would be as simple as uh flipping a switch. I do think though, uh that uh at least sometime forward that the airline would be able to uh get back to offering some full year guidance. Uh because some of these uh bookings occur a lack of course. So, uh maybe you would need at least a couple of weeks of evidence to see that uh booking trends are stabilizing. .You know, Steve, I think you point out something really key in that it's it's going to take a lot to kind of turn or reroute the plane once it's in the sky because you're thinking about kind of a few things here. Number one, it's the capacity side that pretty much every major airline has said we're going to kind of pull back some of the acceleration of our own capacity growth and also at the same time that means that we're going to rely on natural attrition and perhaps not hire as aggressively for that capacity. Plus on the aircraft side, they're all sounds like not willing to take delivery of any aircraft if that means that there's going to be a tariff that's also going to be slapped on it as well. So how many quarters could this be in what these airlines are talking about right now, how many quarters could it have a lingering impact as well? .Yeah, great question. And look, I think the tariffs, uh the economic uncertainty that we're going through today, unfortunately was certainly not anticipated a couple of months ago. Um American, Delta and others have strongly telegraphed uh that they're not going to pay tariffs on these planes. Um so in terms of how long it lasts, it's really hard to to tell, you know, putting on sort of my my top down economics hat. Um, you know, what self-help can the airlines deliver over that period? One easy place of self-help uh is to manage capacity. Uh and what you could see for example, um if the uh economic rebound is a little slower than expected, there's wiggle room to retire aircraft. There's wiggle room to um reduce off-peak flying, uh attrition, hiring freezes and this kind of thing. Um looking at the space overall, I would still say the network carriers because of premium cabin international long haul and co-branded credit card look much better positioned uh than the discount airlines.

Here are a few of the highlights that we've gotten in the past 24 hours. So it's of course Tesla's on the list. It's become one of the latest companies to pull its guidance, and it comes after the EV maker reported first quarter earnings last night saying, quote, ""We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update."" While no reason was explicitly given, CEO Elon Musk did mention the impact of tariffs on the company. He said, quote, ""Tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low."" It follows the broader theme we're following this earning season. Companies highlighting the impact of tariffs on their outlooks in 2025 for Tesla. In particular, it had an effect on its battery business. And that brings me to GE Vernova, talking about it on its earnings call. CEO Scott Strazik saying he's expecting costs to reach up to $400 million this year. The company didn't break down these costs in terms of what tariffs specifically are affecting them. But Strazik did say on the call that, quote, ""The biggest tariff impact to us really sits in the China base."" Norfolk Southern expressing similar concerns this morning on its first quarter earnings call, the railroad reiterating its full year guidance. But CEO Mark George also noted on the call that, quote, ""There's no clear information on how tariffs may impact our end markets and revenues."" And Dave, I want to bring you back in on this, because it comes back to I think what J. Woods, who was on the show yesterday, called the word of the year, right? The theme of the year, uncertainty. And you know, even if these tariffs are going to come down at some point, if you are a business and you're trying to plan, I mean these these comments across these earnings calls make it abundantly clear it's really tough to do. .Well, yeah, I mean we I think about it from an investment point of view, but when you put your feet in sort of the seat of a C CFO, it gets incredibly challenging, right? So when you're modeling out sort of, one, what is our cost space going to be? Um, and then what prices can we charge people for that? Are we willing to pass that on? Can we decrease our margins? These are really hard decisions to make. Uh, coupled with the fact that that could then these tariffs, we talk about them in isolation, but just like we heard a few moments ago, um, they're gonna they can impact the consumer and then will impact employment. So where does that leave you, right? So and or can you again take your operations from China and then start building a plant in the US? That's going to take years. Um, and so it's a really, really challenging time. So I think that word of the year makes a lot of sense. .Yeah, for sure.

Yahoo Finance Senior Credit Card Reporter Ben Walker breaks down how to choose the right card for you..Best travel credit cards for 2025: Get free trips, earn flexible rewards, and enjoy generous travel benefits.Best airline credit cards for 2025.Best credit cards: See our picks for the top cash-back, rewards, travel cards, and more.Best cash-back credit cards: Find the best one for you.Best credit card for gas rewards: How to save at the pump.If you want to take your next trip on points and miles, choosing the right rewards credit card could be the key to a less expensive or more luxurious trip. .I write about credit cards for Yahoo Finance, and I can help you find the best travel credit card, the best airline credit card, or the best hotel credit card for you. .Here's what to consider. .There are two different types of travel credit cards. You have your general travel credit cards. Credit card issuers for general travel credit cards are Chase, American Express, Capital One, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, uh Citibank. .You also have airline credit cards and hotel credit cards. All major airlines have an airline credit card. .For example, you have United credit cards, you also have Delta Airlines credit cards. .So how do you decide? .It's a question of loyalty versus flexibility. If you always stay with a specific hotel group, like Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt, then that hotel credit card may be a good choice. .If you're loyal to a specific airline, like if you live in a city that has a specific hub, like a Delta hub or United hub, then it might make sense for you to, you know, check out co-branded airline cards, because then you'll get perks that are specific to your most convenient or favorite airline. .We do have two flights coming up on Carousel three. .Free checked bags, access to the United Club or Delta Sky Club. If you're not loyal to an airline or a hotel, a general travel credit card with a flexible rewards currency would probably be the best for you. Rewards for general travel credit cards are flexible, meaning you can kind of play the field. .You can redeem your points and miles directly through the card issuer travel portal, or you can transfer them to one of many different airline and hotel loyalty programs. .For example, like if you transfer your points to United, you now have United miles instead of Chase points, and you can only use them on United. .Some general travel rewards cards give you access to high-end lounges, or possibly a TSA pre-check or a Global Entry application credit. .If you're going to be traveling internationally, it makes sense to have a travel credit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. .These are normally a 3% charge that's tacked on to any purchase you make with a credit card when you're traveling abroad. .So that can add up quickly, but if your credit card doesn't charge these fees, then you don't have to worry about it. .Instead, that could just be rewards that you're earning that you can put towards your next trip. I make sure to pay off my monthly balance. .Otherwise, the cost of carrying debt is more than the annual fee. .Scan the QR code for more information about travel credit cards.

The bottom line improved 20.6% year over year due to higher sales and operating margin expansion..Revenues of $2.61 billion edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.6 billion. The top line grew 4.5% year over year due to higher sales in the Freight and Transit segments..Apart from the better-than-expected results, WAB increased the mid-point of its 2025 earnings per share view by 10 cents. This pleased investors, resulting in WAB’s shares gaining value in pre-market trading..WAB widened the projected range for its 2025 EPS expectations due to the tariff-induced uncertainty. The company now expects 2025 adjusted earnings per share to be in a band of $8.35-$8.95 compared with the previously guided range of $8.35-$8.75. The mid-point of the newly guided range (i.e. $8.65) is above the mid-point of the previous band (i.e, $8.55). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a much lower $8.27 per share..Wabtec price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Wabtec Quote.The Freight unit's net sales of $1.9 billion increased 4.2% year over year. This increase was due to the 16.9% uptick in services. The actual segmental sales figure was above our expectations of $1.87 billion. Freight segment’s adjusted operating margin improved 1.6 points year over year to 25.7%..In the Transit segment, net sales grew 5.3% year over year to $709 million, due to strong aftermarket and original equipment sales. The actual segmental sales figure surpassed our estimation of $703.4 million. The segmental adjusted operating margin increased to 14.6% from 12.7% in the first quarter of 2024, aided by higher sales and better gross margins..Total operating expenses in the reported quarter increased $23 million from a year ago to $426 million. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of net sales) deteriorated to 16.3 from 16.2 a year ago. A lower value of the metric is desirable.Wabtec exited the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $698 million compared with $715 million at 2024-end..Long-term debt was $3.5 billion compared with $3.48 billion at 2024-end. During the reported quarter, WAB returned $141 million to its shareholders via dividends ($43 million) and stock buybacks ($98 million)..Wabtec, belonging to the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry, still expects revenues in the range of $10.725-$11.025 billion.

Historically, airlines have been a bad sector to invest in during a recession.","Airlines are among the most discretionary sectors out there, tied closely to the health of the consumer. So, perhaps it is no surprise that the stocks are seeing an oversize reaction to reports suggesting key parties are moving to de-escalate the trade war gripping the U.S. economy..Shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) traded up 10% as of 10 a.m. ET, and shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) were all up more than 5%..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».We are only halfway through airline earnings season, but the message from the companies that have reported is clear: The industry is not seeing a dramatic fall-off from near-record demand, but executives are anticipating declines in demand should tariffs eat into the economy and cut consumer purchasing power..Historically, airlines have been a bad sector to invest in during a recession. Households struggling to pay bills and afford groceries are unlikely to book vacations..On Wednesday, investors were buying in hopes a worst-case scenario could be avoided. The market is up big on reports that the White House is mulling cuts to steep tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that could lessen the blow on consumers and lower the odds the U.S. falls into a recession in the second half of 2025..Investors should proceed with caution from here. The market has been volatile of late, trading up and down based on the latest tariff headlines. It is dangerous to try to get ahead of rumors, and until there are actual moves to de-escalate, it is possible these gains could evaporate just as quickly as they materialized..For those willing to accept the turbulence and look past whatever near-term noise might be on the horizon, Delta and United are the safest investment choices from this group. JetBlue and American have relatively high debt burdens and questions about their revenue models, and Southwest is in the process of eliminating consumer-friendly policies and could see a backlash in the quarters to come..United execs sounded an optimistic tone about the quarters to come even with the headwinds the airline is currently facing. If those headwinds recede, the airline looks best-positioned to gain altitude from here..Before you buy stock in United Airlines, consider this:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-airline-stocks-flying-high-143200823.html,"```json

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against other most undervalued growth stocks to buy now..Growth stocks are companies that grow their revenues and earnings at a faster rate than the overall market does. To identify the true growth stocks, we believe it is important to use a high enough benchmark over a long enough period. In this case, we define growth stocks as companies that managed to achieve a 5-year revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 20%. It is obvious that all else equal, investors would prefer growth stocks, but the truth is that their high valuations and perceived expensiveness may often make them less attractive. It is not rare that high-growth companies end up underperforming simply because their initially high forward P/E ratio gradually contracts over time, partially or entirely offsetting the contribution of high earnings growth. So, the ultimate grail of investing consists in identifying undervalued growth stocks that would continue to grow rapidly and at the same time maintain or even expand their trading multiple..READ ALSO: 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.The growth factor has underperformed year-to-date as the entire US stock market has retracted by more than 15% since its early 2025 highs. The growth stocks performed worse than the market because capital flows to safety assets such as defensive value stocks and gold; the latter is up more than 30% this year, and its price returns actually exceed those of the entire US stock market over the last 10 years. Such situations are rare, and the truth is, by the time growth stocks become cheap enough, many retail investors are no longer willing to buy. This is exactly what’s happening now, as the CNN Fear & Greed index shows a value of 20/100, showcasing an “Extreme Fear” in the markets. This public fear is amplified by the tariff turmoil, especially as the broader market is showing a “Death Cross” on the technical charts. Similar to Warren Buffett’s teachings to be greedy when others are fearful, we maintain our optimistic stance for the long-term financial and economic health of the US and its stock market..The emergence of the “Death Cross” signal on the technical chart turns out to be not as scary as perceived by the masses – empirical research shows that the broader market is actually expected to post a positive return of 1% over the 50 days, following the crossing of the 50 daily simple moving average below the 200 daily one, which already occurred on April 11. We don’t claim that history will repeat itself this time; we want to illustrate that this widely discussed and feared event does not have much substance behind it.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-inc-dal-141210010.html,"```json

CEO Ed Bastian noted, “While parts of our business right now are challenged—and they’re mostly on the Main Cabin lower end—we have not seen any cracks yet in the Premium.” Management emphasized operational reliability, cost containment, and capacity discipline, especially in light of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and recent trade policy changes impacting the broader airline industry..Looking ahead, Delta’s forward guidance centers on aligning supply with demand, with plans to keep second-half capacity growth flat year over year and domestic Main Cabin seats declining. President Glen Hauenstein explained, “We are prudently using our available levers to efficiently manage where and how we fly, focusing on where we have seen the most weakness.” Management also highlighted a focus on protecting margins, maintaining free cash flow, and leveraging diversified revenue streams, while remaining cautious about providing full-year projections given economic uncertainty..Delta’s management addressed the quarter’s mixed results by underscoring the resilience of its diversified business model and the actions being taken to adapt to current industry headwinds.

Indeed, United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) recently walked back full-year projections.  In that context, here's a look at why United is an excellent value stock for long-term investors.","It's no secret that the airline industry is now facing headwinds from the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariff plans. Indeed, United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) recently walked back full-year projections. Still, investing in stocks and airlines is all about the long term, and much of the near-term weakness is already priced into airline stocks. In that context, here's a look at why United is an excellent value stock for long-term investors..The headwinds in 2025 must be addressed because they have caused airlines to reduce expectations. Delta declined to reaffirm its full-year outlook, and United served notice that it would be difficult to hit its existing full-year forecast. Still, in an effort to define the downside to earnings in 2025, United's management elected to offer a ""recessionary environment"" full-year prediction..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».United's ""stable environment"" full-year forecast was unchanged at $11.50 to $13.50 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, while a recessionary outlook calls for $7 to $9. The latter is a recognition that the current economic slowdown could extend through 2025..For reference, management noted that it had ""burned up"" the contingency it had built into its ""stable environment"" full-year outlook, so unless everything goes right, it's tough to see United meeting the $11.50 to $13.50 range, even if the economy stabilizes..That said, even the low point of its recession outlook makes the stock look attractive. Based on the low point of the estimate of $7, United stock trades at 9.6 times 2025 earnings..The valuation looks very cheap, but it's fair to say it reflects some investor concern over United's debt levels. After all, this is an airline with a market cap of almost $22 billion and total debt, finance lease obligations, and other liabilities of $27.7 billion..The debt is a significant concern if a recession lasts. However, as management told investors on the earnings call, it expected to be ""near breakeven, but still positive"" in terms of free cash flow in 2025 (FCF) even in the recessionary outlook..Even in the worst-case scenario in 2025, the stock looks attractive. In addition, there's plenty of upside potential in the stable environment scenario, and United's Chief Financial Officer Michael Leskinen believes hitting the $7 to $9 earnings-per-share range ""would justify significant multiple expansion as we will have proven our financial resiliency."" It's hard to disagree.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-buying-united-airlines-stock-084500810.html,"```json

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against other stocks in Wall Street’s watchlist..Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, in a latest program on CNBC reiterated his concerns about a slowdown in AI spending and said that major technology companies were already facing the impact of a downbeat trend in the industry before the tariff wars started:.“When the MAG 7 reported the December quarter or calendar Q4, six of the seven had their March revenue estimates already cut. So think about that for a second. But the thing is, when the Fed’s cutting like it was last year, nobody cares, right? If the stocks are going up, the charts look good. Why worry about fundamentals or valuations?,” Niles said. “Because the stocks are going higher. So looking forward, I expect all the estimates to come down yet again for the June quarter. When these companies report the March quarter, they were already having troubles when they reported the December quarter before all this tariff stuff kicked in.”.Niles said that companies were buying more ahead of the China tariffs because they expected that duties were coming from the US..“You can just see that from the China export data already, where for China as a whole, in the month of March, exports were up 12.4%. People were expecting 4.6%. So that’s a massive beat there. And so you can already tell demand’s being pulled forward.

Households are more likely to forgo a vacation than a grocery store run, so demand typically falls off if consumers are feeling pinched..In years past, recessions have caused the failure of airline brands including Eastern, Braniff, and TWA..American is relatively healthy compared to those failed brands, but the airline appears more vulnerable than its peers should conditions get worse from here. The airline entered the pandemic trailing rivals including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines Holdings in terms of streamlining, and currently carries a higher debt load than those rivals..American currently trades at an enterprise value, which includes market cap and debt, more than 9 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Delta trades at 6.9 times EBITDA, and United 5.5 times..To be clear, the entire airline industry is much healthier than it was heading into previous down cycle and all of the so-called ""big four,"" which includes American, Delta, United, and Southwest Airlines, have the wherewithal to withstand an extended downturn..But American's quest to catch up with its rivals could be further delayed if conditions do decline from here. We'll know more this week when American announces first-quarter results and updates the market on its outlook for the rest of 2025, but for now investors are understandably cautious about the stock..Before you buy stock in American Airlines Group, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Airlines Group wasn’t one of them.

What its management said had significant implications for the aerospace sector, particularly for Boeing (NYSE: BA).  Here's what happened and why it matters so much for Boeing investors.","Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) was the first major company to report results since the tariff war kicked off in early April. What its management said had significant implications for the aerospace sector, particularly for Boeing (NYSE: BA)..Here's what happened and why it matters so much for Boeing investors..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».First, here's a brief recap of the key takeaways from Delta's first-quarter earnings call:.Revenue increased by 3.3% year over year, behind management's previous estimate for ""closer to 4%"" -- a figure already lowered from guidance for 7%-9% given on the fourth-quarter earnings call in January..The uncertainty around global growth created by tariff skirmishes hit Delta's bookings in the first quarter, and management declined to update full-year guidance in response to current market conditions..Management also announced it would reduce ""expected capacity growth"" in the second half in response to the slowdown and try to protect margins.Frankly, much of this was expected, as Delta's management had already told investors of a tariff-induced slowdown in March, and the escalation in the trade conflict since then is unlikely to have caused optimism among investors..The numbers and lack of full-year guidance are one thing, but management said something else that should concern Boeing investors. Quoting Delta CEO Ed Bastian on the earnings call, ""We will not be paying tariffs on any aircraft deliveries we take,"" and ""If you start to put a 20% incremental cost on top of an aircraft, it gets very difficult to make that math work."".Bastian is talking about Airbus here (it's the only airplane manufacturer Delta is expecting deliveries from this year)..The implication is clear: Either Airbus will have to at least share part of the tariff cost (in this case, tariffs applied by the U.S. tariffs on European products), or there's a risk the order will be delayed or cancelled..While Delta is responding to U.S.-imposed tariffs, the message to Boeing is that non-U.S. airlines could take the same approach to any tariffs imposed by other countries and the E.U. on U.S. products sold in those countries..It gets worse. Airbus and Boeing are subject to increased costs due to tariffs, either directly from an increase in costs from products sourced from the U.S. and the E.U., or from an increase in suppliers' costs due to tariffs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-investors-heres-latest-big-183200097.html,"```json

Delta CEO Ed Bastian was on the cover of the most recent issue of Fortune, talking about how he improved the airline's fortunes through a pursuit of the premium flyer, one who's willing to pay top dollar for perks and business class rather than wait for upgrades..Delta isn't the only airline with that strategy. Bastian himself admires KLM, the Dutch airline headed by CEO Marjan Rintel. The Netherlands wasn't a natural home for a major international hub, my colleague Phil Wahba writes in a Fortune story. The small nation has no need for domestic air travel, but has turned its Amsterdam airport Schipol into a gateway for the rest of Europe, he writes..Rintel worked at that airport, the fourth-busiest in Europe, for 15 years, then spent another 15 at the national airline. She ran the country's national rail system before being hired back to lead KLM, which had 12.7 billion euros in revenue last year..Her strategy has been similar to partner airline Delta's: premiumization. Lounges have sleep cabins and massages. Business-class seats have lightweight, functional doors. Bastian texted Rintel after flying KLM to compliment its service. ""You have no choice but to look around the world, right? The competition comes for you otherwise,” Rintel says of seeing what competitors are doing..KLM's fate is intertwined with its country's, and it now stares down an uncertain global economy.

""It kind of really shows a lack of conviction,"" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which holds shares of United.","By Rajesh Kumar Singh.CHICAGO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's trade war has created the biggest uncertainty for U.S. airlines since the COVID pandemic..With little clarity on how consumers will behave in the face of a potentially worsening economy, carriers are struggling to accurately forecast their business..While Delta Air Lines and Frontier have withdrawn their full-year outlook, United has offered two different earnings forecasts..""It kind of really shows a lack of conviction,"" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which holds shares of United..Economists polled by Reuters expect the aggressive U.S. tariff policy to trigger a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy this year and next, with the probability of a U.S. recession over the coming year surging to 45%, the highest since December 2023, from 25% last month..Since travel spending closely tracks broader economic activity, any recession is widely expected to cut airline revenue..Carriers have traditionally relied on capacity cuts and cost management to protect their earnings in a recessionary environment. They have already started pulling those levers, but a fluid economic situation means they can ill-afford to slam the brakes hard..The popular view in the industry is that the present uncertainty is ""self-inflected"" and could go away overnight if the Trump administration decided to call a truce on tariffs..The current situation is very different from the pandemic when travel demand collapsed, forcing airlines to go into a cash preservation mode, one industry official said..In comparison, the bookings have only softened and could bounce back if the broader economic outlook improves. As a result, airlines are wary of taking measures that could hand advantage to their rivals, the official added..The U.S. domestic market is the best example of this caution. It is currently the softest travel market, with airlines having to stimulate demand with lower fares..United told investors on Wednesday its domestic unit revenue, a proxy for pricing power, would be negative in the current quarter. Yet, its second-quarter capacity, or the seats available on flights, is estimated to be up 8.2% from a year ago - the sharpest growth among major carriers..Andrew Nocella, United's chief commercial officer, said while the company planned to cut unprofitable flying, it was also going to balance market share and financial returns..COST MANAGEMENT.Mixed economic indicators have only added to the industry's conundrum.

Should investors buy the stock now?,"On April 15, United Airlines UAL reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the first quarter of 2025 despite the tariff-induced uncertainty. Moreover, the bottom line improved significantly year over year. Given the current uncertain scenario, UAL has offered 2025 earnings per share guidance for two scenarios — a stable environment and a recessionary environment..The earnings beat and the bottom-line improvement, despite the tariff-induced uncertainties, pleased investors, with the stock gaining 5.5% in the April 15 after-market trading session.  Management stated that this was the best first-quarter financial performance by UAL in five years.  Now, the question is whether it is worth buying the stock at the current price. Let us dig deeper to find out..United Airlines’ first-quarter 2025 earnings per share (excluding 25 cents from non-recurring items) of 91 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. In the year-ago quarter, this Chicago-based airline had incurred a loss of 15 cents per share. Operating revenues of $13.21 billion fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.22 billion..During the first quarter, revenues from premium cabin and basic economy were up 9.2% and 7.6% year over year, respectively. Premium cabin unit revenues were up in mid-single digits. Business revenues were up 7.4%..Domestic travel was soft due to tariff-induced uncertainties. International revenues remained strong, owing to the buoyant demand for long-haul travel. Atlantic unit revenues or revenue per available seat mile and Pacific revenue per available seat mile were up 4.7% and 8.5% on a year-over-year basis..The latest earnings beat was UAL’s fourth in a row, demonstrating an excellent earnings history, with the average beat being 10.3%..United Airlines   price-eps-surprise | United Airlines  Quote.Given the market uncertainty and lack of clarity, UAL has offered 2025 earnings per share guidance for two scenarios..In case of a stable market environment, UAL expects 2025 adjusted EPS between $11.50 and $13.50. In a recessionary environment, UAL expects 2025 adjusted EPS between $7 and $9..To combat the weak demand scenario, UAL intends to reduce off-peak flying on lower-demand days. To that end, UAL aims to remove 4 points of scheduled domestic capacity, starting in the third quarter of 2025..Despite the earnings beat, annual earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 have moved south over the past seven days.

170,2025-04-17 21:32:00,Why decentralized apps matter: Ava Labs Exec explains the real difference,Ava Labs executive John Nahas breaks down the difference between decentralized and traditional apps in a simple analogy.,"Decentralized apps — or “DApps” — are becoming a buzzword in crypto, but most people outside the industry still don’t understand how they differ from the apps we use every day..John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, broke it down in a simple and powerful analogy during a discussion with Rob Nelson on TheStreet Roundtable..Rob kicked things off by asking: what’s really the difference between a traditional app and a decentralized app, and could they actually be the same thing — just run differently?.“Yes, it could be the same app, but doing it in a decentralized way does have advantages,” Nahas replied..He then drew a clear comparison to modern internet infrastructure. “The way we currently operate everything… sits on cloud. It’s Google, AWS, Azure… There is a centralized party there. You are working with another party that at any point can or cannot turn that off, shut that down, take control of possession over your assets, your identity, your information.”.By contrast, decentralized platforms — powered by blockchain — distribute infrastructure across many independent participants. “No one person can turn it off, no one person can alter it, change it. No entity can do that either,” he explained..Taking it to the app level, Nahas gave a real-world example: Delta Airlines..“If Delta launched a decentralized application… me as a Delta Sky Miles reward member… I would own my miles,” he said. “They would sit in a wallet that I own… If the application tomorrow went bust, I still own those assets. I have control… I can choose whether to sell them, borrow against them, trade them…”.The core idea, Nahas stressed, is control. In decentralized systems, users — not corporations — own their data and assets. “What you’re doing is you’re taking control away from a centralized party and putting it into the hands of the participants of that project.”.In an age where control and ownership of digital assets matter more than ever, the shift toward decentralization could reshape the way we interact with the digital world.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-decentralized-apps-matter-ava-133200889.html,"```json

Additionally, the consensus mark implies a 91.2% southward movement from the year-ago actual.

However, with the demand for long-haul travel remaining buoyant, international passenger revenues are likely to have been impressive. International passenger revenues are likely to increase 3.3% year over year, per our model..Labor costs are also likely to have been high, hurting bottom-line performance in the March quarter. We expect salaries and related costs to increase 11.1% in the to-be-reported quarter from the first quarter of 2024 actuals..Due to the slowdown in domestic air travel demand, airline stocks have performed dismally in the January-March period.

He thinks earnings will only rise 1% this year and 4% next year..He warned that the penalty for companies missing earnings estimates, in part caused by too-high analyst forecasts, could be severe..Watch: How this beer-making CEO is dealing with tariffs.The recent penalty for revisions of greater than 5% has been harsh, Parker said, with the average penalty the last two months in the fourth percentile of the past 25 years..Recent companies that have been penalized for warnings in the past month include economic bellwethers Delta (DAL) and Nike (NKE). Shares have gone on to lose 13% and 25%, respectively, in the past month..""We think the consensus numbers need to be materially lowered, and the penalty for downward revisions has been harsh,"" Parker added. ""This combination keeps us cautious with so many companies about to report earnings in the next two weeks."".The risks to corporate profits this year are twofold, with one the byproduct of the other..First up is the Trump administration's scattered approach to its tariff policy, which is paralyzing corporate decision making and causing demand fluctuations..On April 9, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, except China. Tariffs on one of the US's most important trading partners now stand at 145% — the sum of a 125% reciprocal tariff and 20% that Trump previously levied..A 10% across-the-board duty is still being applied to all other imports..Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet.On Wednesday, China signaled it’s ready to resume trade talks with the US — if Washington shows respect and appoints a trusted negotiator..The administration further refined its tariff plans on April 11..The White House issued a rule that spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs, especially the harsher tariffs on Chinese goods.

The company declined to comment..It comes after China imposed 125pc tariffs on US-manufactured goods, which more than doubled the cost of Boeing planes and made it impractical for airlines to buy them, according to Bloomberg..It is the latest move in the tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China, which has seen Washington impose tariffs as high as 145pc on Chinese goods..Boeing has been caught in the middle of the clash, losing access to one of the world’s biggest aviation markets in the process..While Airbus has dominated Western airliner exports to China in recent years, the world’s second biggest economy remains a vital market for Boeing and had been forecast to make up 20pc of global demand over the next two decades.Airbus forecasts that China will have more than 11,000 aircraft in service by 2043, of which 9,500 will be new deliveries..It is also not the first time that Boeing has been a source of tension between Washington and Beijing, as China was the first country to ground the 737 Max jet following two fatal crashes in 2019..It was also one of the last to allow the plane to re-enter service, which led some Chinese airlines to abandon orders..The standoff highlights China’s lingering dependence on imported planes despite its attempts to build up its own aerospace industry. The C919, a rival to the 737 developed by local plane-maker Comac, has won only a handful of export deals.Boeing has what it calls a completion and delivery centre in China but no actual production line there. That is in contrast to Airbus, which operates two final assembly lines for narrow-body jets in the city of Tianjin, 70 miles from Beijing..Currently, around 10 Boeing 737s are preparing to enter Chinese airline fleets, based on data from Aviation Flights Group, with some waiting at Boeing’s manufacturing base in Seattle and others at the firm’s completion and delivery centre in eastern China..Paperwork and payments for some of the jets may have been completed before China’s reciprocal tariffs took effect on April 12, Bloomberg reported, meaning they could still be delivered.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-blocks-boeing-deliveries-retaliation-101109491.html,"```json

But the pause didn't include China, which now has a rate of 145%..But hey, at least Gass has formed an internal ""task force"" to begin figuring out the tariff impact on the business..Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon and CFO John David Rainey met investors in the middle. The company warned on operating profits for the first quarter but left its full-year range unchanged..""I suspended guidance once in my six years and that was during COVID,"" former Hostess Brands CEO Andy Callahan told me..He added, ""CEOs/CFOs do a lot of work to understand the forecast and do sensitivities to those inputs to determine a RELIABLE RANGE of outcomes. When two things happen at once like is happening now ... ie a large range of uncertainty or short time to solve, they will suspend. The level of impact happening now is uncertain and likely outside range of CEOs to solve. They will likely suspend for at least a quarter. Guidance is not required and an uncertain or inaccurate guide is worse than a very rational suspension. And saying it does not include the impacts and keeping the guide is disingenuous.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariff-era-means-you-may-have-to-wave-goodbye-to-earnings-guidance-123010647.html,"```json

That May Change.,"Air travelers hate being told they have to gate check their carry-on bag because overhead bins are full, then it turns out there's plenty of space when they board their flight.","Shelby Knowles / Bloomberg via Getty Images.Southwest Airlines' long-running free bags policy has had a welcome side effect: Its fliers were less likely to complain about having to gate-check their carry-ons..But the airline's newest policies, which take effect late next month, could change that, since travelers who soon will have to pay for bags likely will be more inclined to battle for space in the overhead bins. That, in turn, could mean more grumbling from passengers who wonder why they're asked to check bags—then see bins that appear less-than-full once they board..""We do expect a decrease in checked bags at the ticket counter,"" a Southwest spokesperson said in a statement provided to Investopedia. ""However, we are working to keep the travel experience seamless and as hassle free as possible for our customers and our employees."".This is a common frustration with U.S. airlines. Delta Air Lines (DAL) passenger Karah Preiss posted her annoyance with the carrier on X last September, after she ""was forced to gate check only to get on the plane and see a ton of empty overhead bins. Hate to have to wait for checked bag I didn't intend to check."".""Across the industry, boarding is the most consistent barrier to an on-time departure and the boarding process can be slowed down by customers needing extra time to store their bags due to lack of overhead storage,"" a Delta spokesperson said in a statement to Investopedia. ""We use optimization tools to predict when overhead storage will be full, and while sometimes customers are required to check their bags at the gate, it is always a last resort."".I experienced this myself last fall after flying from New York to Boston. The gate agent announced that passengers in higher-numbered boarding groups would have to check carry-ons because there wouldn't be overhead bin space when it was their turn to get on the plane.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-used-safe-gate-check-090000022.html,"```json

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s other top stock picks with huge upside potential..Wall Street is overflowing with data. If companies are not releasing their earnings, economic data flows almost daily. This abundance of data can be overwhelming, making it easy to miss important signals. That’s why investors monitor billionaires who’ve made and continue to make their fortunes on Wall Street. The list of these billionaires is long, but a few, such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller, stand out..Druckenmiller is a former Soros protégé who, after 12 years at Soros Fund Management, opted to exit and focus fully on his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital, in 2000. He later transitioned this outfit into a family office – Duquesne Family Office – in 2010. Over the past eight quarters (up to Q4 2024), the family office has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. The top 20 holdings weighted have returned 81.63% in three years (cumulatively) and 22.01% (annualized)..READ ALSO: Top 10 Growth Stocks in David Tepper’s Portfolio and Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 13 Growth Stock Picks..This billionaire is widely respected across Wall Street for many things, but most of all, his market acumen, integrity, and agility. One should recall that he was part of the Soros Fund Management crew that shorted the British pound in the early 1990s to the point of almost breaking the Bank of England. His genius in the market has been noticed by many. Ken Langone, another billionaire, described Druckenmiller as the best investor he’s ever known..Druckenmiller is also influential. The Financial Times reports that the veteran investor could significantly influence the direction of the current US government economic policies. Scott Bessent, the current Treasury secretary, and Kevin Warsh, a possible successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, are Druckenmiller’s proteges. According to the FT, these three “have a great relationship”, which implies that Druckenmiller has a direct line to the country’s most crucial economic thinkers..Druckenmiller’s investing strategy is to chase value over hype. In other words, the 71-year-old billionaire focuses on investing in undervalued stocks rather than jumping on trendy ones. Simply put, he prefers solid opportunities over flashy ones. Just recently, he exited two of the most high-profile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. This is an eye-brow-raising move, but if the billionaire’s genius is anything to go by, there must be value he is chasing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-dal-among-203137580.html,"```json

187,2025-04-12 00:41:00,Why Airbus Stock Is Falling Again,A comment from Delta shook Airbus stock this week.,"For the second day running, shares of Europe's Airbus (OTC: EADSY) are declining. As of 11:40 a.m. ET Friday, the aerospace giant's stock is down 2.9%, bringing losses for the past two days past 6%. But why?.Yesterday, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) told investors on its morning quarterly conference call that the airline intends to ""minimize"" any tariffs it might have to pay under President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again ""reciprocal tariffs"" initiative. Said Delta CEO Ed Bastian: ""The one thing that you need to know we're very clear on is that we will not be paying tariffs on any aircraft deliveries we take. ... we've been clear with Airbus on that, and we'll work through and see what happens from that."".Now, you might think that's not really Delta's decision to make. The way tariffs work at a basic level is, the U.S. government sets a tariff rate on goods (like airplanes) imported from abroad. And then whoever imports those goods (like Delta) pays the tariff. Except Delta seems to be saying this is not going to happen, and the question then becomes, if Delta isn't paying the tariffs, then who is?.And the implication is that Airbus will have to pay the tariffs..Either that, or Delta won't be buying the planes from Airbus. It might shop Boeing (NYSE: BA) instead..And now you can understand why Airbus investors are feeling a bit nervous for another day that their company may start losing airplane sales..Don't get me wrong. That may happen. That may be a risk. Airbus builds planes primarily in Europe, after all, and Europe-built planes would be subject to tariffs, so those sales seem at-risk. However, Airbus does assemble some of its most popular A320 and A220 airplanes right here in the U.S. as well, and those planes should dodge tariffs easily. That may even be what Delta was referring to, that in order to avoid paying tariffs, it will still buy A320s from Airbus, and buy only its bigger aircraft from Boeing..It's still not great news for Airbus, true. But it's not a total loss, and Airbus investors don't need to panic just yet..Before you buy stock in Airbus SE, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Airbus SE wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years..Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $496,779!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $659,306!*.Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 787% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 152% for the S&P 500.

Given the current uncertain scenario, DAL decided against reaffirming its 2025 financial guidance. DAL stock has gained 9.6% since the earnings release. Apart from the better-than-expected results, the upside was aided by the 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs..Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar..Delta reported first-quarter 2025 earnings (excluding 9 cents from non-recurring items) of 46 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. Earnings increased 2.2% on a year-over-year basis due to low fuel costs. With oil prices moving south, the average fuel price per gallon (adjusted) fell 11% to $2.45 in the quarter..Delta's quarterly earnings were within the range provided last month when the airline trimmed its earnings per share and revenue outlook. Management cited economic uncertainties and the resultant reduction in consumer and corporate confidence, which hurt domestic air travel demand, as reasons for trimming the outlook..Revenues in the March-end quarter were $14.04 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.81 billion and increasing 2.1% on a year-over-year basis.  The tariff-induced turbulence resulted in domestic revenues being weak, primarily due to softness in the main cabin whose revenues declined 1.2%. Domestic passenger revenues inched up merely 1% year over year. The marginal increase was attributable to the tariff-induced slowdown in domestic air travel demand..International revenues were up 7% year over year, owing to the buoyant demand for long-haul travel. Transatlantic revenues grew 5%, driven by the strength of premium products and network optimization. Pacific revenues were also strong..Delta is the first S&P 500 member in the Zacks Transportation- Airline industry to report first-quarter 2025 results. Other airline S&P 500 members like United Airlines UAL and Southwest Airlines LUV are scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 15 and April 24, respectively..The earnings beat in the first quarter was DAL’s second in the last four quarters.

But with the big banks unofficially kicking off earnings season Friday, the private lobbying and public prodding were also a sign of desperation and a testament that tariff policy and the trade war are all that matters..That won't change.

 .How badly will Trump’s tariffs eat into corporate profits? How can supply chain acrobatics offset the severe levies on China? And what special exemptions can key industries and big-name brands win from the White House? And how to read between the corporate lines, given that companies may be lobbying and hoping for those exemptions?.Corporate earnings have always had a forward-looking orientation. What matters more are the quarters ahead, not the last one. (Just ask Tesla!) But the outlooks attached to first quarter earnings will take on an outsized importance this go-around..Like Thursday’s inflation data, the coming quarterly reports largely won’t account for Trump’s economic policies. And in the flurry of events over the past month, what happened last week on Wall Street might as well be a year ago. And earlier in the quarter is even further in the rear-view. The acceleration of news cycles and the volatility of trading swings have a way of making even recent episodes feel irrelevant and outdated..Analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the first quarter by more than 4%. And it’s still unclear how deeply they will cut forecasts for the year as the tariff policies take shape and make their mark. Some analysts see 2025 as a “lost year” for corporate profits..Getting outlooks from companies at all might be an improbability.

The frequent changes and added costs are stressing a supply chain that has wrestled with shortages of parts and labor..Outside Montreal, workers at Airbus' (AIR.PA) Canadian plant assembled a single-aisle A220 jet over the last several months, even as the shifting tariff policy made it unclear whether the plane would go to its intended customer, Delta Air Lines (DAL), with or without a 25% duty..The rapidly changing landscape means Delta might receive the 130-seat plane without tariffs, or could owe duties to the U.S. government for parts made outside the United States. The aircraft is expected to be delivered in June, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium..Delta and Airbus declined comment on whether the A220 jet would be subjected to the levy..Tariffs have rarely been an issue for aerospace. Aside from an 18-month transatlantic tariff war over Airbus and Boeing (BA) subsidies in 2020 and 2021, the industry has operated under a 1979 treaty guaranteeing zero-duty trading that includes the U.S. and Canada, but not Mexico..But President Donald Trump's frequent tariff changes during assembly of this A220 jet illustrate how his strategy adds risks for planemakers and airlines alike..In early February, as Airbus employees in Mirabel, Quebec, worked on the plane's interior near the start of the assembly line, a source said, Trump threatened a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico. The levy would have raised the cost for Delta substantially on a plane worth about $40.5 million, according to Cirium delivery data from 2024..SHIFTING TARIFF POLICY.Just before that tariff was to go into effect, Trump delayed it for 30 days, and then said goods compliant with the Trump-negotiated U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be exempt from duties. Those requirements forced Canadian aerospace companies to scramble to sort out paperwork they had not previously needed..This particular plane, recently painted in Delta's colors, was believed to comply with the 2020 agreement, and hence exempt from tariffs, industry sources said. Canada's Bombardier has said its jets are compliant, and they have been delivered to U.S. clients without duties, one of the sources told Reuters.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-tariff-confusion-could-leave-050308945.html,"```json

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ​​Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against other best economic recovery stocks to buy..Economic cycles, as defined by economists, alternate between periods of growth, peak, recession, and recovery, depending on the stage that a country’s economy is at. In particular, the term “economic recovery” describes the period that follows a recession and is characterized by improving employment, increased business activity and investment, rising consumer confidence, and accelerating GDP growth. Recoveries usually start after governments enact fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate investment and spending – the primary stimulative instrument in the US has been the FED funds rate. When an economic recovery kicks in, the sectors that tend to outperform are the cyclical ones – consumer discretionary, industrial, financial, and technology – driven by both a recovery in the previously depressed valuations as well as by broad acceleration in growth..Another important consideration for investors is that the stock market and the economy do not move in sync; the former tends to be a forward-looking animal, meaning that stock prices tend to rise in anticipation of an economic recovery, while the actual economic conditions may still be depressed and reflect low GDP growth, high unemployment and sluggish private spending. Consequently, the key takeaway for readers is that investments in economic recovery stocks shall be made during peak uncertainty and pain, at or near a market bottom when everyone is fearful and reluctant to buy. As the legendary Warren Buffet has put it,.“Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”.READ ALSO: 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy According to Analysts..The US economy and stock market are the most developed in the world and often reflect textbook examples of economic cycles. The previous unofficial recession in the US occurred in 2022, when the GDP growth posted 2 quarters of negative growth amid a sharp increase in interest rates to combat rising inflation. The stock market moved in sync with the economy during that year. The following year, 2023, resembled a slow recovery fueled by the emergence of the AI megatrend as well as strong public spending on infrastructure and other large projects. Calendar 2024 and early 2025 resembled an economic peak, as growth moderated and private spending became weaker. In such moments, even the slightest economic headwind and/or uncertainty can trigger a recession and a broad market meltdown. That’s exactly what happened with the new Trump 2.0 administration, which brought plenty of uncertainty related to tariffs and sharp cuts in the public sector.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-air-lines-dal-among-212204153.html,"```json

Demand has already begun to soften, with international travelers visiting the U.S. down 25% from Canada and Mexico, and an estimated 10% worldwide, the firm added. ""We believe the threat to aviation is in demand destruction, a long-term impact largely dependent upon economic scenarios,"" it said..In the short term, this could benefit U.S. airlines, which have a relative point-of-sale advantage, Visual Approach said. Delta Air Lines (DAL), for instance, said on its first-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it has seen strong summer bookings, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense..In the longer-term, however, growth is likely to fall, the analyst said. With tariffs in place, aircraft made for American carriers outside the U.S. are ""likely to be parked,"" VAA said, adding that ""the incentive for the U.S. airlines is to stall for time while the uncertainty is eventually resolved."" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on the earnings call that the carrier no longer envisions growing this year and ""will defer any deliveries that have a tariff."".Shares of Delta sank 11% in recent trading, while rivals American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) dropped 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, amid a broad market sell-off..Read the original article on Investopedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aviation-analyst-sees-long-term-164538745.html,"```json
