I'm Josh Lipton and for the next half hour, we are breaking down the trends of today that will move stocks tomorrow. There's a lot to keep track of, so we're focusing on what you need to know to get ahead of the curve. AI is still alive and well on Wall Street, but the landscape keeps changing as various players enter the AI arena. For more on what you need to know about the biggest names in the game, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Tech editor, and that would be Dan Howley. Dan. .That's right, Josh. We're just going to break down some of the, the bigger names. So to start things off, obviously the 800 pound gorilla, that's OpenAI, and we're going to put Microsoft in there together with them since they have teamed up. Obviously, it's been a very lucrative relationship between the two. Uh, OpenAI has ChatGPT kind of kicked off the entire generative AI explosion. Uh, Microsoft has been using that technology in its co-pilot and and its Azure platform. But more recently, the two were at loggerheads. They can't come to an agreement over how OpenAI should restructure its own business. And so that is leading to some reports that Microsoft may be, you know, trying to work on its own generative AI offerings while OpenAI may be trying to work on its own productivity suites. But after OpenAI and Microsoft, there's obviously Google. Uh, we have their Gemini service. It's similar to what you would get out of ChatGPT. Uh, they offer document creation. Uh, you can upload files, you can create images, things along those lines, but it also has the power of Google behind it. You might have probably used Gemini if you've used basically any Google product at this point because it's across the entire company's ecosystem, whether that's through YouTube, mail, docs, even your regular Google search, when you see AI overviews, that's powered by Gemini. Then after that, we have obviously Meta. Uh, Mark Zuckerberg is trying to recadjigger the company once again after the metaverse fiasco that didn't really go anywhere except for give us some weird looking legless avatars. Uh, now he's going all in on AI, and they seem to be doing relatively well here. Uh, they obviously have Meta AI. It's available through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The problem though is their most recent model called Lama for Behemoth seems to be delayed, and there's no end in sight for when that delay will end. And so now, Meta is going out and scooping up talent from other AI companies, whether that's the CEO of Scale AI, Alexander Wang. Uh, we also had Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO, uh and Safe Super Intelligence, their CEO, Daniel Gross. They've all been packed up. Uh, Sam Altman at OpenAI said Meta is trying to offer some of his employees hundred million dollars to sign on. So I said that on a podcast with his brother, so we can't really know if that's for certain. Uh, after that, obviously, there's some others. There's XAI. That's from Elon Musk. He offers Grock through that. That is their chatbot. You can get it through X. Uh, you can use it on the website or through an app. Big thing about Grock is it's able to pull data not only from the web, but also from X, so it can get live data through there. Then we have others, we have Perplexity. That is basically a search engine built with generative AI in mind. Probably the best example of a competitor to what Google has to offer. Uh, it also has a lot of sourcing available, so it'll show you the sources of each, from each of those results that you search for. Obviously, you can also generate images if you want to do that, things along those lines. Uh, and then finally, we have Anthropic. That's gotten a lot of funding through Google and Amazon. It's available through a number of services, and they as well offer a kind of web browser experience where you can search, you can create different documents and things along those lines. But really, those are the major players that you have to be watching out for. There's a few others. Uh, obviously, we have Thinking Machines from OpenAI alumni. We also have a few others like Mistral out of France. Uh, but these seven here are really the biggest players at the moment. .All right. Thank you, Dan.

1,2025-06-26 21:09:00,Brad Pitt's Formula 1 racing movie debuts Friday. Can it help bring the sport to new heights?,"It’s a huge week for Formula One, but the action isn’t on the starting grid.
“F1 The Movie” aims for glory in the highly competitive summer blockbuster space and is tracking well, per Hollywood insiders.","It’s a huge week for Formula One, but the action isn’t on the racetrack..“F1 The Movie” premieres in the US this Friday, June 27. The blockbuster with a rumored $200 million production budget backed by Apple (AAPL) and distributed by Warner Bros. (WBD) aims for glory in the highly competitive summer release calendar. The movie is tracking well for a strong opening box office, per Hollywood insiders..The film is based on a tried-but-true formula (forgive the pun). Fictional aging racer Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) is brought on to an upstart team to help guide its rookie driver, but along the way he comes face to face with his own personal demons, and of course redemption..But that's the boring part. What has everyone, or at least car buffs, salivating is the access the filmmakers had to the sport: filming at real races using real F1 cars and technology, embedding themselves in the sport, and capturing footage that brings the viewer right into the driver's seat..A movie like this, especially with a big focus on the US audience, would have been a surprise only a few years ago..Part of this is because F1 — considered the most technically advanced, and glamorous, racing league — is finally growing in the US. In 2024, the sport reached about 30 million viewers across ESPN (DIS) platforms, with an average of 1.1 million viewers per race during the season. That's pretty good for a sport that used to count viewers in the thousands less than ten years ago..US fans, who discovered the sport and grew with it as shows like Netflix’s (NFLX) “Drive to Survive” brought drivers into viewers' living rooms, have become a coveted group to market. That's both for the sport, which is owned by Liberty Media (FWONK), and the many brands that have now signed on as sponsors..“[The F1] fanbase across the world is over 800 million; fanbase in the US is 50 million. But the really important thing is doubling year on year,” said James Vowles, the head of Williams F1 and a former longtime Mercedes team exec. “So great trajectory commercially, and if we look at all of the partners and sponsors that we have, a third of them are from the US, which just tells you how important it is.”.Moviegoers, from the hardcore F1 fans to those who just want to see Brad Pitt drive a race car, will be most impressed by how close the filmmakers were to the sport in capturing the action..“It's not a documentary, but it is authentic to us as a sport,” Vowles said. “[Producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer], [director] Joe [Kosinski], and the team were really, really impressive at integrating themselves across [the last two seasons], such that as far as I went, we had an 11th team alongside us. It was really seamless in terms of integration.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brad-pitts-formula-1-racing-movie-debuts-friday-can-it-help-bring-the-sport-to-new-heights-120936369.html,"```json

2,2025-06-27 12:01:00,Hugging Face Co-Founder Challenges AI Optimists: 'Models Can't Ask Original Scientific Questions',"Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face, has cast doubt on the belief that current artificial intelligence systems will lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Wolf told Fortune that today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions. “In science, asking the question is the hard part,” he said. “Once the question is asked, often the answer is quite obvious, but the tough part is really asking","Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face, has cast doubt on the belief that current artificial intelligence systems will lead to major scientific breakthroughs..Wolf told Fortune that today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions..“In science, asking the question is the hard part,” he said. “Once the question is asked, often the answer is quite obvious, but the tough part is really asking the question, and models are very bad at asking great questions.”.Don't Miss:.GoSun's breakthrough rooftop EV charger already has 2,000+ units reserved — become an investor in this $41.3M clean energy brand today..Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market. Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential..Wolf’s comments were in response to a blog post by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who argues that artificial intelligence could compress a century's worth of scientific breakthroughs into just a few years..Wolf said he initially found the post compelling but became skeptical after rereading. “It was saying AI is going to solve cancer, and it's going to solve mental health problems—it's going to even bring peace into the world. But then I read it again and realized there's something that sounds very wrong about it, and I don't believe that,” he told Fortune..San Francisco-based Anthropic is backed by tech giants, including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), and is also known for its Claude family of AI models..For Wolf, the core issue lies in how LLMs are trained. In another blog post, Wolf argues that today’s AI systems are built to predict likely outcomes, act as ""yes-men on servers,"" capable of mimicking human responses but incapable of challenging assumptions or generating original ideas..""To create an Einstein in a data center, we don't just need a system that knows all the answers, but rather one that can ask questions nobody else has thought of or dared to ask,"" Wolf wrote..He cited that real scientific progress often comes from paradigm shifts—like Copernicus proposing heliocentrism or the invention of CRISPR-based gene editing—rather than from answering existing questions..Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100..Wolf also questioned how AI performance is measured today. In his blog post, he pointed to benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam or Frontier Math, which test how well AI models can answer complex but well-defined questions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hugging-face-co-founder-challenges-040151444.html,"```json

""We want to become the organiser of the industry in the artificial super intelligence era,"" Son told shareholders at the group's annual shareholder meeting.  Son likened his aim to the position of dominant technology platform providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google, which benefit from a ""winner takes all"" dynamic.","By Anton Bridge.TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son on Friday said he wants the Japanese technology investment group to become the biggest platform provider for ""artificial super intelligence"" within the next 10 years..""We want to become the organiser of the industry in the artificial super intelligence era,"" Son told shareholders at the group's annual shareholder meeting..Son likened his aim to the position of dominant technology platform providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google, which benefit from a ""winner takes all"" dynamic..At previous public appearances Son has described artificial super intelligence as AI technology that is able to exceed human capabilities by a factor of 10,000..SoftBank has returned to making the aggressive investments that made Son's name, such as an early bet on Alibaba, but that at times spectacularly backfired, like its massive investment in failed shared office provider WeWork..Its AI-related deals this year include acquiring U.S. semiconductor designer Ampere for $6.5 billion and the underwriting of up to $40 billion of new investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI..Son said SoftBank's total agreed investment in OpenAI now stood at $32 billion since first investing in Autumn 2024 and that he regretted not investing earlier. He also said he expected OpenAI to eventually list publicly..""I'm all in on OpenAI,"" Son said..SoftBank had owned around 5% of Nvidia until it sold the stake in 2019, before ChatGPT generated a surge in AI interest at the end of 2022. Nvidia now dominates AI chipmaking and has become one of the world's most valuable companies..Son's latest spending spree follows years of retrenchment after the high-growth tech startups into which SoftBank had invested billions of dollars through its Vision Fund investment vehicles crashed in value from 2022..Fortunes changed again when SoftBank raised some $5 billion listing chip designer Arm in September 2023. The rise in the British firm's share price since has boosted the group's assets, against which SoftBank can take out debt to fund new investment..Son said SoftBank was committed to prudent investment and that, throughout the peaks and troughs, SoftBank has maintained the financial resources and user base such that it can take risks at times..Earlier in June it raised $4.8 billion from the sale of some shares in T-Mobile..(Reporting by Anton Bridge; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Christopher Cushing)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-aiming-become-leading-artificial-021026565.html,"```json

7,2025-06-26 23:31:00,Will Microsoft's AI Services Help Maintain Its Cloud Growth Momentum?,MSFT rides on a surge in AI-driven Azure adoption as custom agents and new MU model push cloud growth even higher.,"Microsoft MSFT has been expanding its Azure platform and AI services to support the growing demand for intelligent tools and automation. The company continues to integrate AI into its offerings. These offerings are built on Azure infrastructure and help organizations create and deploy their own AI agents. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, over 10,000 organizations had used Agent Service, and more than 1 million custom agents were created across Microsoft platforms, up 130% quarter over quarter. Microsoft also processed more than 100 trillion tokens in the quarter, up 5 times year over year..Recently, Microsoft introduced the MU language model, which now powers the new AI agent in Windows 11 Settings. The agent allows users to interact with system settings using natural language. The technology, which is powered by Azure AI, shows how Microsoft is using its AI services to power real-world features across its ecosystem..The launch of the MU model and its integration into Windows is expected to increase usage of Azure’s AI tools and services. As more users and organizations adopt these agent-based features, Azure cloud consumption is likely to rise. This supports Microsoft’s ongoing focus on bringing AI into mainstream productivity and enterprise workflows..In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment generated $26.8 billion in revenues, up 21% year over year. It accounted for 37.9% of MSFT’s total revenues. Azure and other cloud services grew 33%, with AI services contributing 16 percentage points to that growth. Our model estimate for the Intelligent Cloud segment’s revenues in fiscal 2025 is pegged at $105.3 billion, indicating 20.4% growth year over year..Microsoft is facing tough competition from Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, ramping up agentic AI efforts.Amazon’s AWS is making it easier to build agentic AI with tools like Agents for Bedrock, AWS App Studio and Amazon Q that help developers create AI agents that work across apps and data. With built-in support for orchestration and reasoning, Amazon’s AWS is becoming a strong platform for next-gen AI tools..Alphabet’s Google Cloud is pushing into agentic AI with tools like Agent Builder. With built-in orchestration and support for Gemini models, Alphabet is making agent development faster and more accessible for real-world use..MSFT shares have gained 17.7% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 13.5% and 4.5%, respectively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-services-help-maintain-153100201.html,"```json

8,2025-06-27 00:18:00,There Are Currently Better Options Than Microsoft,The reason other Mag-7 stocks are more attractive at the moment.,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies, belonging to the mag-7 and being the biggest company in the world according to market capitalization. While MSFT is definitely a great company, this article will show why it currently is not a buy for me, mainly because there are better deals in other mag-7 companies at lower valuations and better fundamentals..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96%..The same can also be said for growth. While MSFT is not as far ahead of other companies as it was in terms of profitability, a revenue growth rate of 14.13% and an EBITDA growth rate of 19.16% are still great. Furthermore, forward growth rates are even stronger than current ones, suggesting a positive outlook. Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE growth expected to be negative..As with all Mag-7 companies, valuation is the biggest problem for Microsoft. Everyone already knows that we are talking about a great company, so the most important thing to get right is to find a good entrance price. Currently, the EV/EBITDA ratio of the stock is relatively high at 22.8, a 31% premium to the industry median. Moreover, the P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium, respectively. The P/E ratio at 35.11 is also very high at the moment. Figure 1 shows the historical P/E ratio of MSFT as can be seen, the company currently trades at 2020 and 2023 levels, leaving it at a higher bound of its average valuation..When comparing Microsoft's user base to that of other Mag-7 companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), one can instantly see that the company's valuation is elevated. At around 1.5 billion users and a market cap of 3.35T, the company has a valuation of $2.233 per user. At the same time, GOOG and META only have valuations of $820 and $494 per user, respectively, making them much cheaper in comparison. Additionally, ROE is a weak point too, with only Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) being worse at 8.79% and 25.24%, respectively..From a growth perspective, Microsoft is solid but does not particularly stand out at slightly better revenue growth but significantly less EBITDA growth than Alphabet. Furthermore, the negative ROE growth is the second worst in the peer group, with only Tesla's ROE falling by almost 70%. In total, Microsoft seems fundamentally somewhere around the average, with profitability being a strength while growth is a comparative weakness.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currently-better-options-microsoft-093720326.html,"```json

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the top 10 picks from Harvard University’s stock portfolio. The stock’s position in the portfolio was marginally up in Q1, and it accounted for around 9.8% of the portfolio weight..Following the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference held in mid-June, Baird’s analyst Colin Sebastian published a note on June 20 highlighting a potentially underappreciated area of growth for Alphabet: robotics. While the company is best known for its core businesses in Search, YouTube, Android, Cloud, and hardware, Sebastian believes its efforts in robotics AI, particularly through DeepMind, could become a meaningful contributor over time..Google introduced its new Gemini Robotics AI stack at the event, designed to support physical robots capable of language understanding, visual processing, and real-world decision-making. Unlike current industrial robots, which are built for specific tasks, the next wave, enabled by systems like Gemini, aims to handle a broader range of functions with greater adaptability. The analyst compared the upcoming opportunity to the 'ChatGPT moment' for robots..Sebastian pointed out that the Gemini platform incorporates what he refers to as “embodied reasoning”, allowing the same software stack to be deployed across multiple hardware form factors. Demonstrations included robots performing nuanced actions such as folding paper or finding objects, tasks that require a deeper level of contextual understanding than traditional automation..He believes this technology could play a foundational role as physical AI adoption accelerates, potentially evolving into a core platform alongside Android and Google Cloud. While still early, the long-term market opportunity, estimated by some to be over $100 billion, positions Alphabet as a potential leader and a “key enabler” in a rapidly emerging space that may include competition from companies like OpenAI, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla..Given this potential, Sebastian reiterated his Outperform rating on Alphabet shares and maintained a price target of $190..Alphabet Inc.

11,2025-06-26 22:17:00,SoundHound AI vs. Cerence: Which Voice AI Stock Holds More Promise?,"SOUN and CRNC battle for voice AI dominance, but only one is scaling fast across sectors beyond autos with strong momentum.","Voice-driven artificial intelligence is emerging as a key battleground in tech, and SoundHound AI, Inc. SOUN and Cerence Inc. CRNC have positioned themselves at the forefront of this niche. SoundHound is a newer entrant leveraging its conversational voice platform across industries from automotive to restaurants, while Cerence is an established leader in in-car voice assistants for automakers. Both companies operate in the voice AI space, and a comparison is timely as generative AI amplifies demand for voice interfaces.Despite their common focus on voice AI, SoundHound and Cerence differ in scope and strategy. SoundHound’s technology spans multiple industries, powering voice ordering in restaurants and voice-enabled customer service, in addition to automotive voice assistants. In contrast, Cerence is focused on the mobility market, supplying voice assistant software to nearly every major car OEM. The broader market reach of SoundHound compared to Cerence’s auto specialization sets the stage for an intriguing comparison. Let’s analyze which voice AI stock offers better upside potential now..SoundHound has emerged as a leader in voice AI by combining advanced speech recognition with large language models to power natural, voice-based interactions. Its Polaris AI engine delivers fast, accurate responses — even in noisy settings — supporting applications across industries. The company’s acquisitions of SYNQ3, Amelia and Allset have expanded its capabilities in restaurant ordering, customer service and voice commerce. Now operating with a three-pronged strategy — enterprise agents, automotive assistants and voice commerce —SoundHound is gaining traction among automakers and tech firms. Its innovation pace and platform versatility position it as a strong independent player in the voice AI space.SoundHound’s broad industry reach opens up significant growth potential. It’s gaining traction in restaurants, with voice ordering in nearly 13,000 locations, and in automotive, powering voice AI for more than 20 car brands. Its enterprise solutions are used by top global banks, reflecting strong B2B adoption. This diversification limits dependence on any single customer. As generative AI demand grows, SoundHound’s independent, brand-friendly platform appeals to companies wary of Big Tech. Partnerships with firms like Lucid Motors and NVIDIA extend its footprint into luxury EVs and edge AI. Overall, SoundHound is well-positioned to scale across multiple high-growth sectors.SoundHound’s first-quarter 2025 results highlight strong momentum, with revenues surging 151% year over year to $29.1 million, driven by organic growth and recent acquisitions. Key contributions came from restaurant and enterprise voice AI solutions, supporting diversification. While the GAAP gross margin fell to 37% due to integration costs, the adjusted gross margin stood at 51%, with management targeting margin improvements over the next 18 to 24 months. The company posted a non-GAAP net loss of $22.3 million but remains well-capitalized, holding $246 million in cash and no debt. The full-year revenue guidance of $157-$177 million implies a near doubling, and SoundHound is targeting adjusted EBITDA breakeven by year-end, signaling a focus on scaling efficiently toward profitability.Despite operational momentum, SoundHound faces formidable competition from deep-pocketed tech giants. Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL dominate the AI-powered voice assistant market. Google Assistant powers Android Automotive and is well integrated into in-car experiences globally. Amazon’s Alexa, backed by AWS and a large developer community, is expanding into vehicles and has an entrenched smart home base. Apple’s Siri benefits from tight integration across its ecosystem, especially via iPhones and CarPlay. These larger players — Alphabet, Amazon and Apple — could leverage their ecosystems to challenge SoundHound’s growth. Another risk is the company’s heavy spend on R&D and marketing (up 66% year over year due to acquisitions), which must eventually translate into sustainable customer wins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhound-ai-vs-cerence-voice-141700782.html,"```json

12,2025-06-26 21:30:00,Can Broadcom Stock Hit $400 in 2025?,HSBC has slapped a Street-high $400 price target on Broadcom stock.,"Chip giant Broadcom (AVGO) doesn’t always make the front page when the artificial intelligence (AI) conversation kicks off. Instead, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) tend to dominate the headlines. But Broadcom has quietly and steadily become a key player behind the curtain. As AI reshapes everything from cloud infrastructure to autonomous vehicles, Broadcom’s influence is proving to be anything but background noise..Now sitting comfortably in the trillion-dollar club, Broadcom’s strength lies in its highly specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which power the custom AI chips used by tech leaders like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META). These ASICs form the backbone of modern data centers, enabling the intense computational workloads required for cutting-edge AI models..Tesla’s Robotaxis Reportedly Sped and Veered Into the Wrong Lanes.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else..In fact, Broadcom has recently stepped into the spotlight. This time, it's thanks to a bold new Street-high price target of $400 from HSBC, signaling strong conviction in the company’s long-term growth. Could Broadcom actually hit that mark before year-end?.Based in Palo Alto, California, Broadcom spans semiconductors, enterprise software, and cybersecurity, offering a broad portfolio that supports critical technology infrastructure. Its solutions are found across cloud platforms, data centers, wireless networks, and connected devices, playing a behind-the-scenes role in keeping digital systems up and running..With a market capitalization hovering around $1.2 trillion, Broadcom has shown impressive strength in 2025, managing to outperform despite broader market choppiness. While the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained a modest 3.5% year-to-date (YTD), AVGO stock has surged with a 14% YTD climb..The real momentum, however, has come in recent months. Shares have surged 40% over the past three months alone, fueled by rising demand for AI infrastructure and investor optimism. Looking over the past year, Broadcom’s 67% return dwarfs the S&P 500’s 11% gain, highlighting just how sharply the chip giant has broken away from the pack..In its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report released on June 5, Broadcom delivered a standout performance. The firm posted revenue of $15 billion, narrowly beating estimates of $14.95 billion and marking a strong 20% year-over-year (YOY) increase. The growth was fueled by soaring demand for AI semiconductors, while contributions from VMware added an extra boost to the top line, reinforcing Broadcom’s expanding footprint across both hardware and software.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-stock-hit-400-2025-133002755.html,"```json

NVDA — the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) — regained the crown of the world’s most valuable company in terms of market capital..On June 25, the stock price of NVDA closed at an all-time high of $154.31, with a market capital of $3.763 trillion, surpassing one of its major client Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT market capital of around $3.66 trillion..NVIDIA recorded its previous all-time high of $149.41 at January end. Thereafter, the stock fell significantly due to the unveiling of the low-cost Chinese DeepSeek AI platform, the Trump administration’s decision to stop the export of NVDA’s high-end H20 AI processor to China and global turmoil related to trade after President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs..The stock price recorded its recent low in early April. From there, it surged nearly 80% with a year-over-year gain of more than 15%. The recent rally of NVDA is highly commendable despite the fact that the company warned last month that export restrictions would cost it $8 billion in sales and a $4.5 billion inventory write off. NVIDIA is no longer counting any sales from China..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.NVIDIA reaffirmed its commitment to continued innovation, evolution and execution. After the successful execution of Hopper GPUs, NVDA’s Blackwell GPUs have already seen a record high units sold to cloud providers..NVIDIA is expected to unveil Blackwell Ultra — in the second half of 2025 and begin shipping of Vera Rubin — in 2026. In addition, the company decided that it will announce its roadmap for Rubin Next — to be introduced in 2027 and Feynman AI chips in 2028..NVIDIA is supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Four of the “magnificent 7” stocks have decided to invest a massive $325 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 46% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem..Apart from Microsoft, other giant customers are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN. This huge spending on AI infrastructure will dramatically change the world in the next five years in fields like hyperscale automation, robotics, healthcare, energy, materials, financials and cybersecurity. Research firm Oppenheimer estimated that the total addressable global sovereign AI market could be a massive $1.5 trillion..The major innovation for NVDA’s new chipsets is a qualitative shift from pureplay generative AI models to reasoning AI models. NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang, said that contrary to the market’s belief that DeepSeek is a major threat to NVDA’s high-cost chips, it has actually opened a huge growth opportunity for his company.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-regains-lost-glory-buy-121000212.html,"```json

Merck should be able to remain a leader in oncology despite mounting competition.  Let's consider two stocks that meet these criteria: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Merck (NYSE: MRK).","Alphabet can overcome legal headwinds and continue to perform well in the long term..Merck should be able to remain a leader in oncology despite mounting competition..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.The S&P 500 flirted with bear-market territory earlier this year. Although it has mostly recovered, plenty of companies are still dealing with issues that have led to poor performances. Some of them have excellent prospects, though, making their current situations a great opportunity for investors to buy their shares at a discount..Let's consider two stocks that meet these criteria: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Merck (NYSE: MRK). Here is why these corporations are worth investing in at current levels..Alphabet's problem isn't its financial results; in that department, the company is performing well. First-quarter revenue rose 12% year over year to $90.2 billion, while earnings per share came in at $2.81, almost 49% higher than the year-ago period..Some of Alphabet's issues come from regulators. Due to an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., the company risks losing its popular Chrome browser. While that would harm its financial performance, there's still no guarantee that the loss will happen..And even if it does lose Chrome, you can expect a deeply profitable company like Alphabet -- which generated a massive $74.9 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period -- to navigate around that issue..Meanwhile, the tech giant has several important growth avenues, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and streaming (thanks to its YouTube platform). Alphabet's cloud computing and YouTube businesses ended 2024 with a combined annual run rate of $110 billion, matching management's guidance. That accounted for about 31% of the company's revenue in 2024..So these segments grant Alphabet significant growth opportunities. Furthermore, the company has a strong moat due to both the network effect and switching costs..The stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 18, compared to the 18.9 average for communication services stocks. Although that makes it seem like Alphabet is reasonably valued, I believe a company of this stature is worth a hefty premium given its growth opportunities, strong moat, and consistent earnings and cash flow..At current levels, the stock appears to be a steal..Merck's shares have declined significantly over the past year. The market is worried that its crown jewel, cancer medicine Keytruda, will finally meet its match. Keytruda has earned scores of indications across many different types of cancer, and reigns supreme in non-small cell lung cancer, where it's approved to treat patients with a PD-L1 protein overexpression.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-too-cheap-ignore-104500993.html,"```json

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position.","Apple's stock trades at a premium valuation despite putting up slow growth..Amazon's operating income growth is a vital metric..Alphabet is drastically undervalued for its performance..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position. Although it's still the third-largest company in the world, Microsoft and Nvidia have overtaken Apple, likely for good, as the growth these two are putting up far surpasses Apple's..However, I don't think we've seen the last of companies surpassing Apple in terms of market cap over the next few years. I think we'll see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surpass Apple by 2030. Several key factors play into this prediction, but Amazon's and Alphabet's performances aren't the only reason they'll surpass Apple..Apple's brand may be the most valuable on Earth, but that's about all it has going for it. Apple has posted anemic growth over the past few years, and it could be debated that Apple's growth has been essentially nonexistent when inflation is factored into the calculation..Despite that, Apple's stock trades like a hot growth stock, trading at 28 times forward earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 22.8 times forward earnings, with an average growth rate of about 10% per year. Apple's growth rate is far below that pace, so at most, Apple's stock should receive a market-average multiple, at least from my perspective..If Apple's valuation were to decline to a market-average multiple, it would tumble nearly 20%. That would put Apple's market cap at around $2.44 trillion, which is where we'll start our comparison..Currently, Amazon's market cap is $2.23 trillion and Alphabet's is $2.03 trillion. That's not far from the $2.44 trillion that I think Apple should be trading at, but even if Apple's stock stays at its elevated level, I think these two can catch Apple by 2030..Let's start with Amazon, whose growth rate looks rather slow at first glance, similar to Apple's..However, that's the wrong way to look at Amazon's stock. Amazon can be split into two businesses: commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing. While the consumer-facing commerce division is widely known and what most people value the stock for, the real cash cow is AWS. In the first quarter, AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating profits despite making up just 19% of revenue. Furthermore, AWS's operating income rose 23% year over year in Q1.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-worth-more-093000400.html,"{""Strategic Risk"":7,""Operational Risk"":0,""Financial Risk"":8,""Market Risk"":8,""Technology Risk"":0,""Credit Risk"":0,""Legal Risk"":0,""Political Risk"":0,""Reputational Risk"":7,""ESG Risk"":0}"

Alphabet doesn't plan on slamming the brakes on the project anytime soon, as it aims to Waymo Washington, D.C., and Miami next year.","The company rolled out a highly popular service in a new city..This extends its lead over a recent arrival to the business..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Like a robotaxi slowly advancing down a street to approach its destination, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock advanced on Hump Day. Its two share classes both rose in excess of 2% in price during the trading session, on the back of good news for one of its businesses. That bump higher was good enough to beat the flat S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) on the day..That Alphabet business posting the positive development was its accelerating robotaxi service, Waymo. On Tuesday, in partnership with ride-sharing incumbent Uber Technologies, the company rolled out Waymo in Atlanta..The Georgia metropolis now becomes the fifth metropolitan area serviced by Waymo (the others are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin). Alphabet doesn't plan on slamming the brakes on the project anytime soon, as it aims to Waymo Washington, D.C., and Miami next year..The combination of a widening footprint and positive word-of-mouth has boosted Waymo's popularity -- and its ridership. According to recent reporting from Barron's, these days the service is providing over 250,000 rides per week. That's more than double the 100,000 from last year at around this time..With the Atlanta launch, Alphabet extends its lead over ever-ambitious electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla. That company launched its Robotaxi brand in Austin this past weekend; however, it was limited only to a select group of hand-picked users..Both Alphabet's development and rollout of Waymo feels as if they have been well planned and smoothly executed. In Los Angeles, for example, now it's common to see Waymos ferrying customers around the car-clogged city. While robotaxis aren't yet a massive business for Alphabet, they're looking like they'll become an important revenue generator sooner than many might expect.Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.25%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.31%..The internet search leader's shares have seen a decrease of 3.55% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.62% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.05%..The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet in its forthcoming earnings report. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $2.12 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.17%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $78.88 billion, indicating a 10.55% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year..Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.53 per share and revenue of $326.57 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.53% and +10.66%, respectively, from last year..Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability..Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

26,2025-06-26 03:13:00,Want to Invest in Quantum Computing? 2 Stocks That Are Great Buys Right Now.,Are you ready for the next tech revolution? Get the facts before you make your next move with quantum computing specialists.,"Quantum computing is still in its early stages, but investor excitement is already running high..Alphabet and IBM are leading the charge in this exciting market's research and development..While pure-play quantum stocks could soar, it's safer to stick with established leaders..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Quantum computing will change the world someday. Next-generation systems will be able to do certain kinds of advanced math and pattern-matching much faster than today's digital chips. The quantum computing era will change everything you know about encryption and data security, but will also enable incredible innovation in fields such as medical research, weather forecasting, and economics..So the ""quantum advantage"" and ""quantum supremacy"" milestones are coming up, eventually making quantum systems incomparably more powerful for a very specific set of tasks. Problems involving large data sets and extremely precise calculations may look impossible now, but quantum computers may breeze through them quickly..It's a long journey, though. Investors recently got very excited about a couple of baby steps toward this future, sending a few quantum computing stocks sky-high in just a few months. As of June 23, early favorites IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) have seen price gains of 471% and 1,188% over the last year, respectively..But I don't think these are the best bets on quantum computing in 2025. Many of the biggest names in Silicon Valley are funneling their massive resources into quantum research, and I'd much rather hitch my wagon to these innovative powerhouses instead..My preferred quantum computing investments happen to be the engines behind the recent market uproar..Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) got the ball rolling with the Willow chip in December 2024. This small quantum computing processor features advanced error correction, which is an important function in the noisy and error-prone quantum computing process. As impressive as the Willow chip's performance was, it's just the second milestone on the 6-step road to quantum supremacy. Each step so far has taken several years..Just a couple of weeks ago, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced the construction of a large quantum computer with its own set of powerful error correction features. Mind you, this system is more of a plan than a real-world project. IBM expects the Starling computer to be available in 2029.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-invest-quantum-computing-2-214300672.html,"```json

He said Tesla would roll out the service to other U.S. cities later this year and predicted ""millions of Teslas"" operating ""fully autonomously"" by the second half of next year..The Tesla fans invited to the trial were strongly supportive and posted videos of hours of trouble-free driving, but issues drew questions from federal road safety regulators and auto safety experts..Issues included Tesla robotaxis entering the wrong lane, dropping passengers off in the middle of multiple-lane roads or at intersections, sudden braking, speeding and driving over a curb..In one instance, a robotaxi drove into a lane meant for oncoming traffic for about 6 seconds. It had pulled into an intersection in its left-turn lane with its turn blinker on. Then the steering wheel wobbled momentarily, and instead of turning it proceeded straight into the lane meant for oncoming traffic, prompting a honk from a car behind it..In another incident, the car suddenly braked with no obstruction apparent in the video. The passenger jerked forward and their belongings were thrown to the floor. In a third video, taken from another vehicle, a robotaxi abruptly stopped twice in the middle of the road while passing police vehicles with flashing lights..Tesla is conducting the test with human safety monitors in the front passenger seat. A fourth video showed the safety monitor hitting a button to stop the robotaxi when a delivery truck in front of it started backing up..""This is awfully early to have a bunch of videos of erratic and poor driving,"" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert. ""I was not expecting as many videos of problematic driving on the very first day,"" he said. Tesla is testing about 10 to 20 robotaxis, which are standard Model Ys with advanced software, and has been giving rides since Sunday afternoon..Reuters was able to independently verify the locations of at least 11 videos showing issues. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment..A City of Austin spokesperson said officials are aware of the Tesla issues documented on social media and that ""when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company.""

32,2025-06-26 02:32:00,HPE CEO pushes back on tech slowdown fears despite signs of caution from CIOs,Enterprise tech giant HPE said IT spending has been consistent.,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Antonio Neri said there has been no slowdown in IT spending..""Momentum is across all business lines,"" Neri told Yahoo Finance while speaking at the company's annual Discover Conference in Las Vegas. He noted that networking solutions, a part of HPE's core offerings, are needed to deploy more AI and cloud applications..""We see that growth in our orders, and now in our revenue,"" he added..Neri also pointed to continued growth in enterprise demand, particularly around AI and hybrid cloud services. He highlighted HPE's deepening partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) to expand so-called AI factories — infrastructure needed to build, deploy, and scale AI models — as a key driver for growth..But the view from CIOs may be more cautious. According to a new report from KeyBanc Capital Markets, IT budget expectations have slipped. The firm now forecasts IT budgets to grow just 2.7% in 2025, down from 3.9% at the start of the year. If that holds, it would mark the slowest IT budget growth period since 2020..The firm noted broader restraint in the sector. Software vendors are seeing increased scrutiny, and IT hiring plans have scaled back. Major tech employers like Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Salesforce (CRM) have reduced headcounts following a post-pandemic hiring spree. In March, HPE announced a cost-cutting plan targeting $350 million in savings by 2027, primarily through workforce reductions..Tariff-related uncertainty has also weighed on IT. While KeyBanc initially expected 33% of CIOs to say they are being impacted, 42% now report a negative effect. Still, only 19% said they’ve delayed spending, suggesting companies are cautious but not pulling back entirely..HPE beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal second quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 6% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, down 10% year over year. Its intelligent edge segment, which includes networking, had a 7% jump in revenue compared to the prior year, and the hybrid cloud segment grew 13%..The company's pressured server business was responsible for the bulk of its sales at $4.1 billion, a 6% increase over the prior year..Meanwhile, HPE is facing a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its proposed $14 billion Juniper Networks (JNPR) acquisition, with a trial set to begin on July 9. HPE first announced the deal in January 2024. The DOJ blocked the move due to concerns that it would reduce competition and stifle innovation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpe-ceo-pushes-back-on-tech-slowdown-fears-despite-signs-of-caution-from-cios-173230961.html,"```json

YouTube, a segment of Alphabet’s Google Services division, announced on June 18 that it was introducing shopping product stickers in Shorts. This feature within YouTube’s Shorts format is an update that, as per the announcement, aims to simplify the purchasing process for viewers and increase earning potential for creators..Photo by Firmbee.com on Unsplash.Initially, YouTube Shorts had a “Shopping” button, but the product team felt it was “less prominent.” As such, the updated version is more interactive and visual. The new stickers directly indicate that products within the Short are available for purchase. A sticker is automatically generated based on the first tagged product in the Short, and users can resize and reposition it via the mobile app. When multiple products are tagged, a down arrow on the sticker allows users to view and explore the complete product list..The YouTube team said that in a trial conducted in the U.S. in May 2025, Shorts featuring these new product stickers saw over a 40% increase in product clicks compared to those with just the traditional Shopping button..Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a California-based global technology holding company. It is the parent of several popular brands, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, and Android. The company also offers cloud services and makes hardware. It also invests in emerging areas such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health tech (Verily), and internet access (Google Fiber)..While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

38,2025-06-25 23:43:00,Uber Launches Robotaxi Service in Atlanta With Waymo: What's Ahead?,"UBER expands its robotaxi push with Waymo in Atlanta, betting on partnerships to scale self-driving rides fast.","Furthering its robotaxi-related ambitions, Uber Technologies UBER launched an autonomous ride-hailing service in Atlanta with Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo. This has already been available in the service in Austin, TX, since March. There are, at present, around 100 Waymo vehicles on the Uber platform in Austin..Following the launch in Atlanta, Uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of fully autonomous, all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. Riders will shell out the same rates as UberX, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric when driven in a Waymo self-driving vehicle.  The service currently covers 65 square miles around the city but does not include highways. Rides are only available through the Uber app..Apart from the partnership with Alphabet’s Waymo, Uber has associations with many other vehicle firms, as it aims to gain a stronghold in the robotaxi market.  Earlier in the year, Uber inked a robotaxi-related deal with NVIDIA NVDA. The partnership aims to accelerate the development of autonomous driving solutions. By leveraging NVIDIA’s cutting-edge AI platforms, Cosmos and DGX Cloud, and Uber’s vast ride-related data, the partnership looks to create scalable and efficient Autonomous Vehicle (“AV”) models. The alliance with NVIDIA could redefine the competitive dynamics in the robotaxi market..By adopting this partnership-driven approach, Uber has avoided the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. In 2020, Uber sold its self-driving division but continued to focus on becoming the ultimate ride-hailing super app. The company has plans to expand its self-driving taxi service further. Uber now has a run rate of 1.5 million autonomous taxi and delivery trips on its network..Uber’s dominant market share in the ride-hailing industry also gives it a unique advantage in the AV space. With its vast network of drivers and customers, Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures. Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners, giving users a variety of options. Uber’s strategy of leveraging external expertise could prove to be very effective as it aims to gain a stronghold in the robotaxi ride-hailing market, offering massive growth opportunities. The race to deploy robotaxis at scale is set to reshape transportation..Shares of UBER have gained 48.9% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s 12.3% decline in the same timeframe.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-launches-robotaxi-atlanta-waymo-154300409.html,"```json

39,2025-06-26 00:35:00,NuScale Power vs. Centrus Energy: Which Nuclear Stock Has an Edge Now?,"LEU edges ahead of SMR with strong HALEU demand, DOE support, and superior earnings potential despite sector growth for both.","NuScale Power SMR and Centrus Energy LEU are major players in the evolving nuclear energy landscape, each contributing to the future of advanced nuclear technology. NuScale is focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs), while Centrus Energy specializes in the enrichment of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which is a critical fuel source for powering SMRs in the future.Per Fortune Business Insight report, the global SMR market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, expanding at a CAGR of 4.98% from 2025 to 2032. Both Nuscale Power and Centrus Energy are likely to gain from the massive growth opportunity, as their technologies are poised to play a key role in meeting the rising global demand for safe, reliable, and carbon-free nuclear energy.So, SMR or LEU — Which of these Nuclear stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out..NuScale Power is benefiting from advancements in SMR technology. The company’s expanding partner base, which includes tech giants and financial institutions, positions SMR as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy. The company is gaining strong momentum across various sectors, especially as energy demands continue to rise. The increasing energy demand, driven by sectors like data centers, which require continuous, reliable, and carbon-free energy, has been a major growth driver.Data centers are expected to triple their energy use over the next three years, accounting for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. This growth trend presents a significant opportunity for NuScale Power, as its small modular reactor technology offers consistent, carbon-free energy that can meet the increasing demands of hyperscale data centers.NuScale Power continues to attract strong interest from major technology companies and infrastructure capital. Companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet and Oracle have made substantial commitments to using nuclear energy, including SMR technology, to meet their sustainability goals, which positively impacts NuScale Power’s market positioning..Centrus Energy is benefiting from increased demand for nuclear fuel, particularly HALEU, and from its role in developing and deploying advanced nuclear technologies like SMRs. HALEU is expected to play a significant role in fueling advanced reactors. The Department of Energy (DOE) has released supplies from its HALEU availability program to five advanced reactor developers, highlighting the growing demand for this type of uranium.LEU recently announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has extended its HALEU production contract through June 30, 2026, as part of Phase III of its ongoing agreement. This follows Centrus’ successful delivery of 20 kg of HALEU in Phase I and ongoing production of 900 kg under Phase II. The extension marks the start of a potential eight additional years of production to support advanced nuclear reactor development.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuscale-power-vs-centrus-energy-153500512.html,"```json

Altering those cells to make genetically modified children is intended to eliminate inherited diseases or enhance desirable traits, which can be passed on to future generations..Scientists and ethicists said the technology known as “germline editing” is unproven and potentially dangerous. It could have grave consequences if a flaw is introduced into a days-old embryo, with the changes affecting every cell and stage of development. If the technology does work, they fear it could usher in a new era of eugenics and foster further inequality..“When you’re messing with the safety of babies, you want to be pretty confident,” said Hank Greely, a Stanford University law professor and bioethics expert. “We have no idea what would happen to the babies who are edited.”.Experts would be especially concerned if the efforts are conducted in private laboratories without public access, oversight, review or protection, said Laurie Zoloth, a professor of religion and ethics at the University of Chicago..“There are safer ways to avoid having a child with a genetic disease than trying to build one from scratch as if it’s some sort of commodity that you put together with cool parts,” she said..Chief Executive Officer Chase Denecke and Chief Technology Officer Ben Korpan founded Bootstrap Bio after writing a viral essay using the pen names GeneSmith and kman on LessWrong, a forum popular in Silicon Valley. The essay was about about gene editing adults to make them smarter.

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this company have returned -3.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.18 indicates a change of +6.8% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-alphabet-inc-130004022.html,"```json

Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms each have market capitalizations of more than $1 trillion, and tend to dominate their markets and investors' attention..Don't get me wrong: All of those are solid investments. But it's also a good strategy for tech investors to look elsewhere for new opportunities. After all, companies like Palantir Technologies were barely a blip on the radar just a few years ago. But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems. And each has a market cap of less than $100 billion -- which means there's plenty of room for further growth and profit for your portfolio..DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) got its start in 2013, but it's one of those companies that really took off during the pandemic, as people were much more interested in eating at home than venturing out. That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives..The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns..DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms..If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). Sea is a multifaceted technology company involved in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial services. Its Shopee business is a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, and also operates in Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's Monee segment (formerly called SeaMoney) provides financial services in Southeast Asia and Brazil.

Listen up.,"Alphabet could be the best business you can buy today at under 20 times earnings..Arista Networks is a fairly priced tech leader with data center growth ahead..Generative AI could give a major boost to Booking Holdings..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.The stock market continues to show its resilience, and that's especially true for stocks in the technology space. The tech-forward Nasdaq Composite index is trading within striking distance of its all-time high..But as the saying goes, this is a market of stocks, not necessarily a stock market. In other words, just because the broader market is riding high, that doesn't mean that investors can't still find good deals within it..For instance, take the three top technology stocks below. Two trade at fair valuations today, which is all investors really need to do well over the long term. However, the first company is such a compelling bargain right now that it had to lead things off..Here is what you need to know about the three top tech stocks to buy right now..Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) might be the best bargain you'll find in the technology sector right now..Fears over the potential threat that artificial intelligence (AI) poses as a competitor to Google Search, as well as concerns that antitrust regulators will convince courts to mandate the break-up of the Google ecosystem, have weighed on the stock to the point that Alphabet trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18 today. Investors' fears are legitimate, but the selling simply appears to have gone too far..For starters, Alphabet is a player in AI and has integrated its version, Gemini, into its search ecosystem. So, even as AI models begin to draw traffic away from traditional search queries, Alphabet is still monetizing some of them, as noted in the company's first-quarter earnings call. Until Google's ad revenue begins to deteriorate -- it grew by nearly 10% year over year in Q1-- it seems too early to panic..Meanwhile, Alphabet is a prominent competitor in other high-growth industries. It's the third-largest cloud infrastructure company, and the rising adoption of AI is poised to drive significant growth in cloud usage in the coming years. Additionally, Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary has emerged as the leader in autonomous vehicles; its driverless ride-hailing service continues to announce expansions into new areas. Alphabet is a compelling buy here, even with analysts lowering their long-term earnings growth estimates to an average annualized rate of 15%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-tech-stocks-buy-082500889.html,"```json

To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia..Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage..Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares..Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-070000205.html,"```json

Analysts have projected that the AI market will be worth trillions of dollars in the next five to 10 years. If you have $3,000, that's more than enough to invest in a few of the companies set to capitalize on the AI boom..For the best results, you may want to split your money among companies that each focus on different parts of the AI market. Here are three options to consider..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. It creates AI chips that tech companies use in their data centers, similar (but not entirely identical) to GPU maker Nvidia..Semiconductor stocks are an excellent AI investment opportunity. They provide the hardware necessary to run the most advanced AI models, and the semiconductor industry is growing to meet rising demand. The global semiconductor market grew by 19.7% in 2024, and is projected to grow another 11.2% in 2025..Broadcom stands out from the competition because it makes customizable chips called AI accelerators. Some of the major hyperscalers, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms, use Broadcom to make their own custom AI chips. It's rumored that OpenAI is another company partnering with Broadcom for this reason. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan says that it has three hyperscaler customers expected to deploy 1 million AI accelerators in 2027..Broadcom is on the pricey side, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38. That's common for AI companies, and based on Broadcom's momentum and earnings projections, this could still be a good time to invest..It beat expectations in its second fiscal quarter of 2025, with revenue rising 20% year over year to $15 billion. AI revenue was particularly impressive, growing 46% year over year to $4.4 billion. Tan expects that to grow even more in the third quarter to $5.1 billion..Tech conglomerate Alphabet is integrating AI throughout its products and services. Perhaps the most well-known example is the AI overviews that now sit at the top of Google search results. Alphabet has also added AI tools to Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, etc.), launched its Gemini chatbot, and uses AI for its self-driving car project, Waymo.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-3-000-3-artificial-000000425.html,"```json

Expanding to Atlanta and offering robotaxi services in Phoenix and Austin, Uber has used Waymo’s autonomous driving features that are integrated in the Jaguar Land Rover I-PACE electric SUV. Investors have long awaited the future innovation of robotaxis from Tesla TSLA, and the use of the I-Pace has strengthened Uber’s brand and market expansion while helping the company stay ahead in the autonomous mobility race without the upfront capital burden, since Waymo handles the technology. Additionally, Uber has a partnership with Tesla as well, focused on EV expansion, with Uber drivers getting discounted purchases when buying Tesla’s or renting Tesla’s via Hertz HTZ..Similarly, Avis stock is thriving as the leading car rental operator has prioritized better vehicle utilization by improving its car fleet with EV models from Kia and French automaker Renault. Leading to higher investor sentiment, Avis’s upgraded fleet is expected to improve its operational performance by lowering maintenance costs, in an expected return to a higher-margin business model. Furthermore, Avis has invested in EV infrastructure through charging stations at major rental hubs and has received a boost from tariffs on imported vehicles, as this has made buying new cars more expensive and raised the value of the company’s fleet of used vehicles that can be bought on its dedicated platform, Avis Car Sales.. .Based on Zacks' estimates, Uber’s total sales are currently forecasted to increase 15% in fiscal 2025 and FY26, with projections edging toward $60 billion. Following a record-breaking year for earnings, Uber’s bottom line is expected to contract to $2.90 a share in FY25 from EPS of $4.56 in 2024 ($9.86 billion in net income). That said, FY26 EPS is projected to rebound and rise 22% to $3.53.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-uber-avis-stock-higher-220800570.html,"```json

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian, Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace, and Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman join Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to discuss what Waymo's expansion means for Tesla's rollout, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) safety review, and Tesla's competition with Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.","Tesla's (TSLA) robotaxi launch hit some early roadblocks with speed and traffic violations reported during tests in Texas, while Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo expands its service to Atlanta..Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian, Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace, and Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman join Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to discuss what Waymo's expansion means for Tesla's rollout, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) safety review, and Tesla's competition with Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT)..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here..The start of Tesla's robotaxi tests apparently didn't go as smoothly perhaps as the company touted.  Yal Finanz Prize Submarine is here with that story, Prize. .Yeah, we're just showing that the Hollywood set where they did the actual presentation last October didn't go exactly as planned. We saw a lot of the Tesla stands excited about taking their robotaxis right. But there were some hiccups, right? We saw some of the videos that they were taking some of the vehicles were speeding above post speed limits. And then most egregiously, there was an incident where a car, you see right here, attempted to turn left, didn't actually do that, and went straight through a left hand turn only lane, and then crossed a double yellow, as you see here, which is also a traffic violation, a major one actually in Texas. So Nizza says that they're aware of these incidents, and they're monitoring them, and that they'll take necessary actions to protect road safety. So Nizza is kind of possibly getting involved here. Meanwhile, Waymo entering Atlanta, like they said they're officially up open for business with partnering with Uber as their sort of platform partner. So you know, Waymo's with Uber in Atlanta, and also Austin, where Tesla's tests is taking place. And then also they're in LA, San Francisco, um, and places like that. .Do you think, Prize, you you hear about something like this, does it in any way, could it in any way slow down, disrupt the expansion of this service across the country? .You mean these little hiccups here? Yeah. I, it kind of brings a little bit of the enthusiasm down, but it's not ready for prime time, right? They have the safety drivers, riders sitting in the passenger seat, you have teleoperators who are remotely watching the car. You know, a lot of Tesla investors are excited about the fact that this test actually started, it's happening. But they have a long way to go to catch up to Waymo, which is doing 250,000 completed robotaxi trips a week without sort of these incidents that we're seeing right now in Tesla. .All right, let's bring in our ensemble now for more on the ride shares today. Tesla, got a Google, Uber, Lyft, they're all in focus. Julie, you know, I, Tesla did slip a bit today, of course they had a nice pop yesterday. Though, as Prize rightfully points out, as Musk begins this journey here, he's got some big competition, including Waymo. .Yeah, I mean, and if if there are these hiccups, I mean, as we know, federal regulators have sort of left it up to states and municipalities, whether they're even going to allow these things to go forward. You see it going forward on a city by city basis, right? So even though Tesla is still proceeding with its tests in Austin, if it continues to see, I mean, like, we're calling it a hiccup, but, you know, it could have been a lot worse, right? So the question is, how is Tesla addressing these issues? And then the next question is, when Tesla goes to apply for its next approval in its next city, is this going to inform that? Is this going to then cause some friction with letting that move forward? Now, we always know if we're on an Elon Musk timeline, you can't necessarily expect things to happen as he thinks or says that they will. Um, but this is just one more thing to consider when we're talking about that sort of speed to market, and then capturing that market share. .Chris, I want to bring you here as well, as the one person on the panel who actually has a portfolio to run here. What do you make of this big fight? I got Tesla, Waymo, got Amazon in there, Uber, Lyft. .Yeah, it's kind of a crowded space. Uh, you know, and it's kind of an emerging market. Uh, I, I think that this is going to be proven out over time. I think that the interesting way to play it from a, you know, differentiated way is, maybe we don't focus necessarily on, uh, you know, what Google is doing or Tesla is doing, but what does this mean for Uber? What does this mean for Lyft when we think about the removal of a key cost for them, right? And the amount of incremental profits that can drop to the bottom line once they have made these investments. To me, that's a lot more exciting.

Citigroup raised its price target on the stock from $158 to $163, suggesting potential upside from its previous close..Similarly, Guggenheim reaffirmed its ""buy"" rating with a $165 price target. The positive analyst sentiment comes amid growing interest in Reddit's role in the artificial intelligence space, particularly through collaborations like its deal with Alphabet's Google to use its vast user-generated content for training AI models. This has fueled investor optimism about the company's future growth and monetization strategies, despite recent volatility and a class-action lawsuit related to disclosures about its user growth..The shares closed the day at $140.78, up 5% from previous close..Is now the time to buy Reddit? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free..Reddit’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 64 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business..The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 8 months ago when the stock gained 42.4% on the news that the company reported strong third-quarter earnings..Reddit beat revenue and EBITDA, especially despite the slight DAU underperformance. However, platform engagement was still strong, with Logged-out users up 70% year-over-year..Notably, the company reported that ""Reddit"" was the sixth most Googled word since the start of the year, pointing to the strong potential to convert more internet users to its platform. It also highlighted the potential to continue to grow and optimize ad revenue as the company continues to experiment with new ad formats..The company's optimistic EBITDA forecast for the next quarter also blew past analysts' expectations. Overall, this was a great quarter for the company..Reddit is down 15% since the beginning of the year, and at $140.97 per share, it is trading 37.4% below its 52-week high of $225.23 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Reddit’s shares at the IPO in March 2024 would now be looking at an investment worth $2,795..Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Would Google lie to you?.I just ""googled"" pizza. Now lying hidden behind the tools section is what used to be front and center: a ridiculous estimate of 2,030,000,000 search results. I clicked on the last page of search results, and voilà, it now says: Page 18 of about 179 results..What a lie. But if you are making an estimate it is OK. You can estimate whatever you want. All's fair in love and war, and business I guess..Related: OpenAI makes shocking move amid fierce competition, Microsoft problems.But what about the measly 179 pages it found? Am I living the Truman Show? I guess my island is just a little bit bigger than Truman's, and that is why I got 179 results. I hope you will agree that it is extremely improbable that there are only 179 web pages containing word pizza on the internet..We all trust Google. We have to. There is no better search engine available yet, sadly. We are all stuck inside these hideous bubbles. Little prison islands..Things are changing and not for the better. Many people now do their searches with reddit.com in the search query, to find the information they are looking for on Reddit. They are replacing one bubble with another..When Google launched the artificial intelligence overview feature last year, it quickly turned into a scandal. AI was giving ""amazing"" advice to people, like telling them to use glue to stick cheese to pizza. Eating rocks is fine, as long as you stick with one a day..The problems were quickly patched, but the issue is that the number of potentially dangerous hallucinations is infinite. You have to keep patching the damned thing ad infinitum. Does that sound like a good and viable plan to you?.In their National AI Opinion Monitor: AI trust and knowledge in America, Katherine Ognyanova, and Vivek Singh from Rutgers University, write: ""Americans across all demographic groups trust information produced by mainstream media journalists more than AI-generated information. Overall, 62% trust journalistic content “some” or “a lot”, compared to 48% who trust AI content."".Related: Apple WWDC underwhelms fans in a crucial upgrade.This statistic tells me that people have a short memory, and that the previously mentioned incident is now ancient history..Google is faced with a new kind of competition, which now doesn't have to crawl the ""whole"" internet to provide search results. The agentic AI era has led us to internet scraping of a lesser scale being able to provide the answers to user's queries in the form of chatbots.

The company's proprietary supercomputers, full suite of AI solutions, and competitive pricing mean that revenues will soar in the coming years.","Zacks Rank #3 stock Nebius Group (NBIS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure company that offers its customers a full-stack AI solution. Currently, Nebius AI is benefitting from the hottest and fastest-growing area on Wall Street – AI infrastructure. Essentially, the company provides the backbone and compute power for companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) that are building the most powerful AI systems in the world, like the ChatGPT and Gemini large language models (LLMs). Building and training these complex, technologically advanced AI systems requires a massive amount of computer power and equipment..In simple terms, Nebius is akin to a specialized electricity company, but rather than providing power, the company provides the lightning-fast computer power and technology needed for AI. However, what makes Nebius special and unique is how they offer their products:.·       NBIS has its own supercomputers: Nebius builds and operates its own data centers that it fills with the latest and most advanced graphic processing units (GPUS). In other words, rather than building their own data centers and setting up the complex AI technology themselves, big tech companies like Microsoft can rely on NBIS data centers and use them as a service..·       NBIS has competitive pricing: Because Nebius is focused solely on AI solutions, the company can provide more competitive pricing than general cloud providers, for example..·       NBIS offers supplemental products: Nebius’s laser-focus on AI also allows the company to offer a full suite of products that extend beyond just compute power. Its add-on software solutions make running AI models simpler and more efficient..Nebius AI builds proprietary hardware like servers and racks, allowing it to vertically integrate its business. In addition, NBIS has partnered with Nvidia (NVDA) (the top AI chip company) to leverage the industry-best Nvidia GPUs and access powerful ‘GPU clusters’ to run AI models at scale. Meanwhile, Nebius also has an essential partnership with big tech juggernaut Meta Platforms (META). Meta leverages NBIS technology to train its Llama large language model. While the details of the partnership are under wraps, investors should not underestimate the significance of the partnership.

These new tools align with CEO Sam Altman’s vision of transforming ChatGPT into a lifelong personal assistant, including at work..This development comes at a sensitive time in OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft, which holds approximately 49% stake in OpenAI’s for-profit unit. The two companies are currently negotiating a restructuring of OpenAI’s for-profit operations, with both sides seeking favorable terms..The planned features would resemble functions offered by Microsoft’s Office 365 and Google’s Workspace, two dominant software suites in business IT that have already incorporated generative AI tools into their platforms..Beyond document collaboration, OpenAI appears to be developing a broader ecosystem including a browser, an AI-powered hardware device, and a social content feed within ChatGPT. These initiatives suggest the company is seeking greater control over how users create, access, and share content online..For enterprise customers who currently use ChatGPT as a standalone tool, these integrated productivity applications could make the platform a more central component of company workflows.

70,2025-06-25 00:15:00,CoreWeave Vs Nvidia: Which AI Stock is the Better Investment,Investors may be wondering if the hype for CoreWeave's stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia.,"Backed by Nvidia NVDA, CoreWeave CRWV stock has skyrocketed more than +300% since launching its IPO in late March, as investor confidence has swooned for the AI cloud infrastructure company. To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia.   .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage.. .Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares.. .Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-vs-nvidia-ai-stock-161500955.html,"```json

Meanwhile, rival Waymo is expanding into another US city..In several videos posted to X.com, Tesla Robotaxis appear to violate local traffic laws by driving above posted speed limits, swerving across lanes, and hesitating to turn..In one instance, a rider named Rob Maurer posted a video in which a Tesla Robotaxi enters a left-turn-only lane, then proceeds to go straight through the intersection and cross a double yellow line the process, committing two traffic violations in the process..Tesla stock was down 2% in early trade..The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has taken notice..“NHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,” a spokesperson said to Yahoo Finance. “Under US law, NHTSA does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems — rather, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets NHTSA’s rigorous safety standards, and the agency investigates incidents involving potential safety defects.”.NHTSA said following an assessment of the incidents, it will take any necessary action to protect road safety, adding that its investigation into Tesla’s FSD-Supervised/Beta software remains open..Tesla is operating its limited test in Austin, Texas, with select users able to summon Tesla Model Y robotaxis, of which 10-20 seem to be in operation. Bloomberg News was first to report on Tesla’s Robotaxi infractions..Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo, considered the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 robotaxi trips completed each week with no safety driver, has officially opened for business in Atlanta..Via Uber (UBER), Waymo allows users to summon its robotaxis for driverless rides. Uber said in a post that riders will be able to travel across 65 square miles of Atlanta, with plans to expand in the future..“Riders who request an UberX, Comfort, or Comfort Electric could be matched with a Waymo fully autonomous all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicle — at no additional cost. Before a nearby Waymo vehicle is sent your way, you’ll always have the option to accept or switch to a non-AV ride,” Uber said in a statement..In addition to Waymo's Uber partnership in Atlanta, the companies continue to offer robotaxi rides in Austin..Waymo offers its robotaxi services through its own app in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix and will also be adding New York City to the list via a supervised test soon..Tesla hasn’t revealed its next steps or when the general public will be allowed to summon a Robotaxi in Austin. Musk has said he expects “millions” of robotaxis to be driving around by the second half of 2026, but the CEO has a history of making highly speculative predictions that have not come to fruition.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-incidents-eyed-by-regulators-as-waymo-opens-up-service-in-atlanta-154814761.html,"```json

The company announced a partnership with Alphabet's Waymo in Atlanta that will allow people to order Waymo rides exclusively through Uber's app..The partnership comes in the same week that Tesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, an event the market also met with enthusiasm. Atlanta is now the second market Uber and Waymo have partnered in. The two companies also forged a partnership in Austin, where there are now more than 100 Waymo vehicles exclusively available through Uber. Waymo trips in Austin have an average rating of 4.9 stars, according to Uber..Riders in Atlanta now have the chance of being paired with an autonomous, full self-driving vehicle at no additional cost, although riders will have the option to switch to a regular human-driven vehicle if they choose..Riders in Waymo vehicles will also have 24/7 access to customer support through the Uber app and Waymo's in-car screens. The Atlanta launch will start with 65 square miles of Atlanta, from the downtown area to Buckhead to Capitol View, and Uber and Waymo plan to expand in the future..Uber has no plans to build its own self-driving cars, but instead plans to partner with major players in the space -- and this strategy seems to be off to a good start. The company's platform, massive fleet, and operational experience makes it an ideal partner for autonomous companies, and presents a potentially large new revenue opportunity for Uber.

Specifically, Zuckerberg explained how these companies often restrict Meta’s ability to innovate within their ecosystems, citing Apple’s iMessage as a powerful “lock-in” that discourages users from switching platforms. This competitive environment has influenced Meta’s decision to invest heavily and early in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, even before the market is fully mature..Zuckerberg says the strategy is actually working, as shown by the latest release of Apple Vision Pro, which largely failed due to its poor design, $3,500 price tag, and lack of relevant features or utility. Zuck touted this win, saying “our VR products are better and 10 times cheaper than Apple.”.Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Says the Technology They’re Developing Will ‘See What You See and Hear What You Hear’.The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..'Record-Shattering': Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Has Now Paid $101 Billion in Cumulative Federal Income Tax.Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox.

The company plans to launch multiple new AI-powered wearable devices in 2025, signaling a major push to expand its hardware portfolio and user base..Mark Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook in 2004 and has since transformed it into Meta, a technology conglomerate focused on social media, artificial intelligence (AI), and immersive experiences. His vision for the “metaverse” — a persistent, shared virtual space — has driven Meta’s substantial investments in VR and AR, despite significant financial losses in Reality Labs, which have exceeded $60 billion since 2020..Zuckerberg’s assertion about Meta’s VR products being superior and more affordable than Apple’s fits within his broader strategy to democratize access to emerging technologies. By prioritizing cost efficiency and user experience, Meta aims to overcome the entrenched ecosystems of Apple and Google, which dominate mobile platforms and often limit third-party innovation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vr-products-better-10-times-152428433.html,"{

Developers can control and fine-tune the model to suit various needs using natural language prompts..In benchmarks, Google claims the model performs at a level close to the cloud-based Gemini Robotics model. The company says it outperforms other on-device models in general benchmarks, though it didn’t name those models..In a demo, the company showed robots running this local model doing things like unzipping bags and folding clothes. Google says that while the model was trained for ALOHA robots, it later adapted it to work on a bi-arm Franka FR3 robot and the Apollo humanoid robot by Apptronik..Google claims the bi-arm Franka FR3 was successful in tackling scenarios and objects it hadn’t “seen” before, like doing assembly on an industrial belt..Google DeepMind is also releasing a Gemini Robotics SDK. The company said developers can show robots 50 to 100 demonstrations of tasks to train them on new tasks using these models on the MuJoCo physics simulator..Other AI model developers are also dipping their toes in robotics.

However, at a little over 16 times estimated profits, its valuation is a fraction of Tesla’s at 150 times, a multiple based heavily on expectations for a service that investors had been waiting years for..“People are underestimating Waymo in a pretty significant way, while overestimating Tesla,” said Samuel Rines, macro strategist at WisdomTree. Alphabet’s valuation “assigns basically zero value to Waymo even though it has the best tech, it is already operating, and it has deals with OEMs,” referring to original equipment manufacturers..Alphabet rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla shares were little changed..Investor excitement about self-driving technology is rooted in the vast size of the potential market. Annual ride-hailing sales could exceed $325 billion by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. As much as $20 billion of that could come from robotaxis, analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a research note on Monday..Waymo currently offers self-driving paid rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and San Francisco and just began offering trips through Uber Technologies Inc.’s platform in Atlanta, with Miami and Washington expected next year. Last week, Waymo applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City, sending Uber and Lyft Inc. shares lower..Waymo was valued at more than $45 billion in October, putting it roughly on par with the market capitalizations of both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. It’s a drop in the bucket for Alphabet, however, with a market value of more than $2 trillion..Still, Waymo is an increasingly attractive part of Alphabet’s portfolio and should offer “long-term upside” for shareholders, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-lacks-tesla-stock-buzz-101252621.html,"```json

TSLA shares are breaking out above multi-week highs and are up more than 6% in early trading as volume turnover is swelling and tracking to levels of more than 60% above the 50-day average volume..Silicon Valley legends like Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t get to where they are without massive risk-taking and a ‘move fast, break things’ approach. For instance, after Elon Musk scored his first $175 million fortune with the successful sale of PayPal to eBay,he immediately began deploying most (but not all) of his capital to his new endeavors – SpaceX and Tesla..However, when the 2008 Global Financial Crisis hit, Musk was forced to risk all of his capital (and actually had to borrow money) to survive. The bet paid off, and the rest is history – Musk became the wealthiest person on Earth..Whether it’s X.com (formally Twitter) or SpaceX, Musk prefers to move at lightning speed and fix mistakes later. Nevertheless, Musk is wisely taking a measured approach with the robotaxi debut since the stakes are high. With global car sales slumping and Musk’s recent political, reputational damage, Tesla’s robotaxi service must move forward without a hitch..As a result, Tesla is debuting the robotaxi in a geo-fenced-in zone, charging a low fee of $4.20, and has a safety rider in the front passenger seat to ensure the debut goes smoothly. Thus far, investors are cheering the measured side of Elon Musk..The robotaxi launch is invite-only and includes social media personalities and investors. Tesla is using modified Model Y vehicles (the best-selling car currently) with updated software instead of the futuristic Cybercab concept Musk initially pitched..The move to use Model Ys was likely to avoid falling further behind Alphabet’s rapidly expanding ‘Waymo’ robotaxi service. With Waymo already operating in Austin, investors will be watching to see which service clients choose once Tesla opens up its robotaxi service to the public..Between Musk’s controversies and slowing sales, TSLA still has its fair share of skeptics. For example, prominent short seller Jim Chanos is bearish on the company, citing valuation concerns and competition. However, these skeptics will likely have to eat their words if Musk and his Tesla team can scale its robotaxi service into 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-131600943.html,"```json

81,2025-06-24 21:00:00,Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Alphabet (GOOGL). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned -2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.53 points to a change of +18.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.28 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-googl-trending-stock-130005772.html,"```json

Others have showed vehicles traveling a few miles per hour over the posted speed limit or stopping in the middle of the road when a user requested the vehicle pull over, per Bloomberg..Most social media and analyst accounts of the service have been positive so far, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives writing that it impressed his team during their rides..Tesla shares remain down about 15% since the start of the year..UPDATE—This story has been updated to reflect the latest share price information and the Uber-Waymo news. .Read the original article on Investopedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-extends-robotaxi-rally-124913569.html,"```json

""This stock trades at ten times revenue. You have a [stock] multiple that's insane."".Washington Crossing Advisors is wholly owned by boutique investment bank Stifel (SF). It has about $2 billion in assets under management..Morganlander said he personally owns tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which operates the more established Waymo autonomous taxi service. Waymo first launched its driverless taxis in Phoenix in 2018..""Waymo has been proven, and it's working in many cities,"" Morganlander explained. ""And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. We would pick Alphabet instead."".Listen: Why Qualcomm's CEO is all in on car tech.To Morganlander's point, there remains a large disconnect between Tesla's valuation and its fundamentals. It extends beyond the stock's revenue multiple, including its lofty forward price to earnings multiple of 178 times. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) trades at roughly 21 times..This comes as consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 have plunged 77%, 70%, and 71% for Tesla since October 2022, according to new research from JPMorgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman..You can study Tesla's falling EPS for yourself on the Yahoo Finance platform..Meanwhile, the EV tax credits that have supported demand for Tesla vehicles are likely going away soon under the Trump administration..Read more: How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance.These tax credits have been a driver of Tesla's sales and profits. Brinkman estimates EV subsidies represent about 52% of Tesla's current profits, which could be wiped out by Trump's ""big, beautiful bill."".And lastly, in April Tesla reported top and bottom line misses for the first quarter due to waning EV demand and controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk's political activities..""You look at that multiple and it's hard to imagine them growing into that in any short period of time,"" Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz said on Opening Bid.

It's the world's No. 1 search engine, and its presence in our daily routine and Alphabet's moves to use artificial intelligence (AI) to continually improve results should help it remain on top.","These stocks are trading in the bargain bin..They all offer investors significant long-term growth potential..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Though indexes have rebounded, the first half of the year has been rocky for investors. The market had to digest a variety of uncertainties, from geopolitical problems to mixed economic data and the U.S. plan to tax imports. All of these factors -- particularly the import tariff announcements -- have weighed on investors' appetite for stocks..But in recent weeks, trade talk progress has lifted investor optimism, and this, along with strong corporate earnings reports, has helped the S&P 500 return to positive territory for the year. Many great bargains still exist though, making now a fantastic time to invest. Here are my five dirt cheap favorites to buy before the second half, which starts next Tuesday..Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the cheapest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" technology stocks that led market gains last year but tumbled this year amid concerns about tariffs and their impact on the economy. Today, the stock trades for 17 times forward earnings estimates, a steal considering the company's earnings track record, strong moat, and prospects across its main businesses..This tech giant is the owner of something many people use every day: Google Search. It's the world's No. 1 search engine, and its presence in our daily routine and Alphabet's moves to use artificial intelligence (AI) to continually improve results should help it remain on top. This is key because Alphabet generates most of its revenue through advertisements across the Google platform..Alphabet's Google Cloud also is proving to be a huge part of the revenue picture, generating double-digit quarterly growth in recent times. Again, AI is part of the story as Alphabet makes available a wide range of AI tools for customers. With AI growing in leaps and bounds and Alphabet's price low, now is the perfect time to invest..Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) doesn't yet have products on the market so we can't use traditional valuation metrics to assess the stock price. Instead, it's important to look at pipeline progress, the potential market for its products, and Viking's financial health..This biotech is working on a variety of candidates for metabolic conditions but the one that's captured investors' attention is VK2735 for weight loss. An injectable candidate is set to start phase 3 trials, and the oral formulation has already started phase 2 trials. Earlier trials have produced strong results, and demand for weight loss drugs is booming -- the market is set to approach $100 billion by the end of the decade.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-favorite-dirt-cheap-stocks-111000957.html,"```json

Companies are racing to build their best platform, which is no small task, considering how difficult quantum computing is to do well.  Quantum computing isn't currently deployed at any scale, as the companies involved are still trying to prove its worth with various workloads.","Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment hype in December..IonQ's platform offers several key advantages over some of its competitors..10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›.Quantum computing is just in its infancy. Companies are racing to build their best platform, which is no small task, considering how difficult quantum computing is to do well. Quantum computing isn't currently deployed at any scale, as the companies involved are still trying to prove its worth with various workloads. However, should a company offer a compelling quantum computing solution, the stock could take off and become an absolute monster..Two stocks that I believe could become monsters in the quantum computing world are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). Both companies can massively benefit from a successful quantum computing deployment and are my top picks in the quantum computing investment realm..Alphabet kicked off the latest round of investor interest in quantum computing in December when it announced that its Willow quantum computing chip completed a five-minute task that would have taken 10 septillion years (10 to the 25th power) to complete. Now, this computation is only possible using quantum computing, so this test is in Willow's favor, but it noted a significant breakthrough..Quantum computing differs from traditional computing because it uses qubits instead of bits. While bits transmit information as either a 0 or a 1, qubits can have values ranging between 0 and 1, which allows them to process an infinitely larger amount of information per computing unit. However, because the answer isn't exactly a 0 or a 1, this can introduce errors into the calculation..Solving this basic quantum computing problem has been the goal of every company involved in the quantum computing arms race, and each company has come up with its own solution for mitigating errors..Alphabet's solution was to place qubits in a particular grid, allowing them to interact with each other. This interaction has been proven to reduce errors, providing Alphabet with a viable quantum computing solution, as its two-qubit gate fidelity was 99.86%..IonQ takes this grid approach a step further. Every qubit in its system is connected to every other qubit, which it refers to as all-to-all connectivity. They believe this offers a superior solution to any system that doesn't allow every qubit to interact with each other. It has enabled them to achieve a 99.9% or greater two-qubit gate fidelity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-quantum-computing-stocks-could-103000861.html,"{

These included providing extra choice for users between search products and clear attribution for publishers when their content is used to generate answers using artificial intelligence (AI)..It also said it would consider whether news publishers should be paid for how their content is used by Google, although it delayed this decision to next year..Oliver Bethell, the senior director of competition at Google, said: “The UK has historically benefitted from early access to our latest innovations, but punitive regulations could change that..“Proportionate, evidence-based regulation will be essential to preventing the CMA’s roadmap from becoming a roadblock to growth in the UK.”.A source close to the investigation suggested that the CMA was not in “lockstep” with the Government and its growth agenda..The CMA’s crackdown on “big tech” has clashed with Labour’s push to cut red tape and make Britain a more attractive place to invest. In January, Marcus Bokkerink, the CMA’s chairman, was forced out by ministers over concerns the regulator was not aligned with Labour’s efforts to boost growth..In a speech in December, Sir Keir Starmer took aim at “the regulators, blockers and bureaucrats” whom he said were hurting the UK economy..On Tuesday, the CMA said its planned measures would “help unlock broader growth, investment and innovation in the UK tech sector and wider economy”..It will make its final decision on its designation of Google in October..Google search accounts for more than 90pc of all queries in the UK, far eclipsing rivals like Microsoft’s Bing and new services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The average Briton makes between five and 10 Google searches per day..For years, news groups, rival technology companies, online retailers and travel providers have warned that Google’s dominance of the internet has distorted markets and threatened their businesses – prompting competition scrutiny around the world..The CMA’s findings are its first under new powers brought in this year, providing it with wide-ranging authority to demand tech giants change how their products work, hit them with fines, or even break them up.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-fights-monopoly-inquiry-attack-102147018.html,"```json

Its pivot away from first-party games and toward a pure platform model has sharpened margins and heightened market attention, but it also sets a high bar the platform must keep clearing..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with APP..In this article, I analyze the company's business evolution, unpack its platform economics, test whether the current financial trajectory warrants today's premium valuation, and finish with where I believe the stock can go next..AppLovin began as a hybrid model, operating both a software platform for mobile app marketing and a portfolio of its own mobile games (Apps segment). This dual structure allowed AppLovin to bootstrap its advertising algorithms with first-party data from its games, but it also meant the company was part game publisher and part ad-tech provider. In 2024, the Software Platform (Advertising) segment contributed about 68% of revenue, while the Apps (gaming) segment was 32%. However, advertising revenue grew 75% year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, whereas Apps revenue grew only 3%. This trend accelerated into early 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, advertising revenue soared 71% YoY to $1.159 billion, while Apps revenue fell 14%. Clearly, AppLovin's future lies in its high-growth ad-tech platform..With that in mind, management made a strategic move of divesting the entire Apps segment. AppLovin announced an agreement to sell its mobile gaming portfolio (about 10 studios and hit titles like Cash Tornado and Wordscapes) to Tripledot Studios for roughly $400 million in cash and around a 20% equity stake in Tripledot. CEO Adam Foroughi said while acquiring game studios years ago helped train AppLovin's machine learning models, we have never been a game developer at heart. In other words, AppLovin's core identity is as a technology platform for app monetization and marketing, not as a content creator. By divesting the games, the company sheds a slow-growth, lower-margin segment. The sale also eliminates any conflict of interest with its clients (third-party app developers). They may have been wary of relying on an ad network that also owned competing games..Source: AppLovin.At its core, AppLovin offers an end-to-end software platform that helps app developers acquire users and monetize their apps. Key components include AppDiscovery (user acquisition campaigns), the AppLovin Exchange (ad network marketplace), and MAX mediation (the leading in-app bidding platform that maximizes ad revenue for publishers). AppLovin's secret sauce is its data and AI engine, dubbed AXON. AXON is a sophisticated machine learning system that ingests billions of data points from across AppLovin's network (ad impressions, clicks, installs, and in-app events) to optimize advertising in real time. Because AppLovin historically operated its own games and, critically, owns the mediation layer (MAX), it enjoys a rich stream of first-party data with every ad impression and user action. This vertical integration (ad network + mediation + first-party content) created a closed loop of data that competitors struggled to match.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applovin-80-margins-survive-outside-094035178.html,"```json

The electric-vehicle maker deployed its first-ever driverless cabs in Austin, Texas, on Sunday in a small-scale test of carefully monitored Model Y vehicles.  Next, the company faces the steep challenge of executing on CEO Elon Musk’s ambition to refine the software and upload it to millions of Teslas within a year or so.","By Rachael Levy, Norihiko Shirouzu and Abhirup Roy.(Reuters) -Tesla finally has a robotaxi. Now comes the hard part..The electric-vehicle maker deployed its first-ever driverless cabs in Austin, Texas, on Sunday in a small-scale test of carefully monitored Model Y vehicles. Next, the company faces the steep challenge of executing on CEO Elon Musk’s ambition to refine the software and upload it to millions of Teslas within a year or so..Such a rapid expansion will prove extremely difficult, about a dozen industry analysts and autonomous-vehicle technology experts told Reuters. These observers expressed a range of views about Tesla’s prospects but all cautioned against assuming a light-speed robotaxi rollout..Some pointed to advantages Tesla might exploit to overtake rivals including Alphabet’s Waymo and a host of Chinese auto and tech companies. Tesla has mass-manufacturing capacity, and it pioneered remote software updates it can use for self-driving upgrades. The automaker also does not use sensors such as radar and lidar like Waymo and most rivals; instead, it depends solely on cameras and artificial intelligence..“A rollout could be really quick. If the software works, Tesla robotaxi could drive any road in the world,” said Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, while cautioning that Tesla is still “testing the product.”.In Austin, Tesla launched a choreographed experiment involving maybe a dozen cars, operating in limited geography, with safety monitors in the front passenger seat; remote “teleoperators”; plans to avoid bad weather; and hand-picked pro-Tesla influencers as passengers..For years, Musk has said Tesla would soon operate its own autonomous ride-hailing service and also turn any Tesla, new or used, into a cash-generating robotaxi for its customers. That will be “orders of magnitude” more difficult than testing in Austin, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor focused on autonomous-driving regulation..“It’s like announcing that, ‘I’m going to Mars’ and then, you know, going to Cleveland,” Smith said..Musk has said Tesla will reach Mars, in that metaphor, quite quickly: ""I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,"" he said in April..Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla shares ended 8.2% higher at $348.68 on Monday on investor enthusiasm over the robotaxi launch..Given Tesla’s AI-dependent approach, its challenge will be machine-training robotaxis to handle complex traffic “edge cases,” said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.

The company said that this tool is still in the experimental stage and users will need to opt in to it through Search Labs..Once a user has opted in, they can ask queries in English. Google didn’t specify whether it plans to support local languages or when that might be available..Users can search for answers to complex, multi-part queries such as “My kids are 4 and 7 and have lots of energy. Suggest creative ways to get them active and moving indoors, especially on hot days, without needing a lot of space or expensive toys.” Additionally, users can ask follow-up questions to refine results..Google started testing AI mode with premium subscribers in the U.S. earlier this year. The company then started broadly rolling out the feature to all U.S. users after its Google IO event. Over time, the company has added a shopping feature, introduced voice and image search support, and introduced ads..The company said that voice and image search features are supported for users in India, given that voice is a popular mode for search. It added that the AI mode is powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The company also noted that early testers of the AI mode are asking 2x to 3x longer queries..With more than 870 million internet users, India is one of the biggest markets for Google. It also acts as a testing ground for the company to observe how multilingual users use its products..While Google still has a lion’s share in the search market, people have started using chat-based AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity more in their daily lives. With AI mode, Google wants users who prefer that kind of interface to use its own product..Apart from AI mode, Google has been pushing products such as AI overviews, which summarize query results for you, in search. The company said in April that more than 1.5 billion people are using AI overviews across the globe. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google’s AI features are hurting publishers, which have seen traffic drop-offs from organic search.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-introduces-ai-mode-users-054004938.html,"```json

While Alphabet's great strength and the source of its wealth is the advertising it sells for its omnipresent search engine, the company has been pushing into other cutting-edge tech ventures for much of its corporate life.","Alphabet's Waymo is not the only option for robotaxi service anymore..It's not like the new competitive threat is massive, however..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.On Monday, an Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) rival took a turn in the spotlight, draining attention and sentiment from the tech giant. The Google parent's two publicly traded stocks ended the day around 1% lower in price, comparing unfavorably to the nearly 1% gain of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)..That rival is Alphabet's peer in the self-driving taxi space, Tesla. On Sunday, the high-profile auto company officially launched its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Although rides were limited to selected users, the event went off smoothly, without any reported accidents..While Alphabet's great strength and the source of its wealth is the advertising it sells for its omnipresent search engine, the company has been pushing into other cutting-edge tech ventures for much of its corporate life. One of the more prominent of these is its own autonomous taxi service, Waymo, which has been operational in a handful of U.S. cities for months, even years..With the launch of the Tesla service, Alphabet now has a competitor in the self-driving taxi space. Investors rarely like when one of their companies suddenly loses a big competitive advantage..Yet the reactive hit to Alphabet's stock was minimal, most likely because many investors realize that the self-driving taxi segment isn't (yet) large enough to seriously impact either their company or Tesla..On top of that, Tesla hasn't revealed when, where, or to what degree it'll expand its Austin Robotaxi rollout. This suggests that the company is being cautious -- as it should be -- about widening the service..So far, the auto-taxi space has been developing more smoothly than many expected; if it maintains the pace, such services will be commonplace before long. While Alphabet's Waymo now has competition (and more will surely come), it's not getting knocked off its perch as No. 1 in the near future..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday.

Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions. The company expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. Management execution has been good in recent times, which has helped Alphabet to build solid cash and short-term investment balance. Additionally, GOOGL's earnings are expected to grow 18.3% for the current fiscal year. .Intuit Inc. (INTU) is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals globally.Intuit’s recent performance has been benefiting from steady revenues from the Online Ecosystem and Desktop business segments.

The Credit Karma business is benefiting from strength in Credit Karma Money, credit cards, auto insurance and personal loans.

Only select invited Tesla users were invited to test the robotaxi service in Austin..Scaling a robotaxi business that could take on industry leader Waymo (GOOG, GOOGL) would take thousands of vehicles operating without safety operators, as well as creating the infrastructure to clean and service the robotaxis..While some see the robotaxi launch as the start of a new era, others think the scale issue will be a big one..""We believe the much better question ahead is on the path of scaling, which we believe will be long, and we caution against overoptimism,"" Barclays' Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients Monday morning. Levy has an Equal weight rating (the equivalent of Hold) and a $275 price target..In addition to scale, there is a big concern over safety. Other players, like GM’s Cruise (GM) and Uber (UBER), had to cease operations following high-profile accidents, with an Uber test leading to a pedestrian death..Earlier on Monday Reuters reported that Tesla said answers to regulator NHTSA's questions regarding safety of its robotaxi operations was confidential business information, and should not be made public..Nonetheless, Wall Street bulls were cheering Tesla’s early success..“We took two approximately 15 minute rides around Austin and the key takeaways are that it was a comfortable, safe, and personalized experience,” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note published late Sunday. Ives has an Outperform rating on Tesla and a lofty $500 price target..In a particularly tense moment, Ives said, the robotaxi drove up a hill on a narrow road with cars parked on both sides, oncoming traffic, and people opening their car doors into the road, but the robotaxi “masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety among this chaos.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-pops-8-after-foundational-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-200136126.html,"```json

In April 2025, xAI launched Grok Studio, a split-screen workspace that lets users collaborate with Grok on generating documents, code, reports, and browser games. It also launched the ability to create Workspaces that let you organize files and conversations in a single place..While OpenAI and Microsoft have similar tools, Google’s Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building. Google’s tools can edit Docs and Sheets and allow you to chat with Gemini while looking at or editing documents. The difference is that Gemini Workspace only works within Google’s ecosystem..It’s not clear what types of files xAI’s editor might support aside from spreadsheets, or whether xAI plans to build a full productivity suite that could compete with Google Workspace or Microsoft 365..If Owji’s findings are true, the advanced editor would be a step toward Elon Musk’s ambitions to turn X into an “everything app” that includes docs, chat, payments, and social media.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leak-reveals-grok-might-soon-181657484.html,"```json

104,2025-06-24 00:25:00,Tesla finally began a limited version of long-promised robotaxi service. But there were some bumps,Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi service began in Austin Texas for a select group of the company’s fans.,"Tesla’s much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company’s fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat..It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step..Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet..But the start of the Tesla service Sunday was only a fraction of any of that. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March..But the Austin test pressed on regardless..The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives’ team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday..Ives’ note to clients, which cited how a Tesla “safety monitor” sat in the front passenger seat while no person was in the driver’s seat, praised the quality of the rides taken by his team member..“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.”.But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. In one YouTube video, the robotaxi drove on the wrong side of the road after it attempted and abandoned a left turn, only to continue traveling down the street on the opposite side of a double yellow line before making the left turn on the following block. Fortunately, there were no vehicles driving on the other side of the road.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-finally-began-limited-version-162518514.html,"```json

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman chat with Washington Crossing Advisors senior portfolio manager Chad Morganlander and Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz about the event and what it means for Tesla investors..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here..All right, now let's turn to my stock of the day. That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

Its diversified ecosystem includes Google Search, YouTube, and AI cloud solutions.  For nearly three decades, Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has shaped the communications revolution.","Strong demand for Alphabet's AI-powered products is a tailwind for long-term growth..Its diversified ecosystem includes Google Search, YouTube, and AI cloud solutions..The tech giant makes an excellent choice for investors with a long-term horizon..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.For nearly three decades, Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has shaped the communications revolution. From leading online search to innovating mobile apps, Alphabet has continued its legacy of innovation into the age of artificial intelligence (AI)..The stock has delivered an impressive 145% return over the past five years; yet, further growth and earnings momentum could still make it a smart bet for investors. Here are 10 reasons Alphabet stock is a great addition to your portfolio today..AI is reshaping the economy, boosting productivity and creativity. Alphabet is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the demand, leveraging vast amounts of user data across its diverse platforms to develop cutting-edge AI models such as Gemini..Alphabet's AI capabilities enhance the user experience while driving efficiency in its core advertising algorithms. Significant investments in AI infrastructure, including custom chips, should ensure Alphabet stays at the forefront of a major growth opportunity..Alphabet's AI prowess is evident in the company's flagship Google Search service, which commands over 90% of the global search market. Its AI-driven features are improving ad targeting and conversion performance..In the first quarter, Alphabet posted net revenue growth of 12% on a year-over-year basis, with Google Search increasing 10%. This tailwind has propelled profitability. Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.81 soared 49% compared to the prior-year quarter, suggesting the business is as relevant as ever..Another cornerstone of Alphabet's business is YouTube. The video streaming platform now counts 2.7 billion monthly active users, having evolved into a broader social media ecosystem. The company has seen significant traction in subscription services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, diversifying revenue beyond ads. Alphabet's internet video dominance provides a competitive edge within the tech space..Fueled by the data-intensive requirements of AI, Google Cloud has also been a key growth driver for Alphabet, capturing market share from competitors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Demand for Alphabet's cloud computing enterprise solutions, including AI-driven tools and robust data analytics platforms, drove annual segment revenue growth of 28% in the first quarter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-reasons-buy-alphabet-stock-140000355.html,"{

108,2025-06-23 21:45:00,Baidu vs. Alphabet: Which AI Powerhouse Stock Deserves Your Cash?,Can BIDU compete with GOOGL's AI edge and financial muscle despite its setbacks?,"Baidu BIDU and Alphabet GOOGL share roots in Internet search and have evolved into global AI heavyweights, each riding the wave of generative AI and cloud services. Baidu, China’s dominant search engine, has leveraged its platform to develop and deploy advanced AI models—like ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1—as well as autonomous driving technology through its Apollo initiative. Alphabet, Google’s parent, spans search, advertising, Cloud, YouTube, and hardware, and is spearheading AI progress with Gemini 2.5, AI-powered Cloud services, and TPUs such as Ironwood.The recent surge of interest in generative AI and language models has put companies like Baidu and Alphabet in the spotlight. Google’s rollout of AI features (like its Bard/Gemini AI for search) and Baidu’s launch of its ERNIE Bot (an answer to ChatGPT) underscore how both are racing to monetize AI innovations. Investors are wondering which company is better positioned today for upside. Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu is the unrivaled search leader in China, controlling roughly 60% of China’s search engine market. This core search dominance provides a massive user base and ad platform akin to Google’s in its home market. Beyond search advertising, Baidu has aggressively invested in next-generation tech: its Apollo autonomous driving unit and Apollo Go ride-hailing service are growing (Apollo Go saw a 75% year-over-year increase in rides in first-quarter 2025), and Baidu’s AI Cloud division is booming with 42% revenue growth in the last reported quarter. AI Cloud's non-GAAP operating margin now sits at the level of teens, aided by improved revenue mix and scale efficiencies. The company’s focus on full-stack AI infrastructure and rapid model iteration—most notably the release of ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo—has significantly reduced inference costs while enhancing performance. These improvements make Baidu’s AI Cloud offerings highly cost-competitive, especially as enterprise clients increasingly look to deploy Gen AI applications at scale.Baidu faces several key challenges as it pivots aggressively toward AI. Its online marketing revenue declined 6% year over year, reflecting weakness in its traditional ad business amid a transition to AI-powered search that is not yet fully monetized. While AI-generated content now powers 35% of mobile search results, monetization remains in early testing, putting pressure on near-term revenue and margins. Additionally, Baidu reported negative free cash flow of RMB9.2 billion (excluding iQIYI), driven by rising investments in AI infrastructure, cloud services, and autonomous driving. The company also faces intensifying competition from rivals like Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY in the AI cloud space, while U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips could disrupt its infrastructure scale-up. Although Baidu touts flexibility in chip sourcing and strong GPU utilization, these constraints could still impact efficiency. Moreover, the wide scope of its AI initiatives, from foundation models to digital humans and robotaxis, raises execution risks and may strain resources in the near term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-alphabet-ai-powerhouse-134500273.html,"```json

109,2025-06-23 21:39:00,Tesla Launches Robotaxi in Austin: Are Industry Dynamics Favorable?,"TSLA kicks off its first paid robotaxi rides in Austin, testing autonomous tech as rivals race to scale nationwide.","Tesla TSLA launched a small group of self-driving taxi service in Austin, TX, marking the first time its autonomous vehicles transported paying passengers without a human driver behind the wheel. CEO Elon Musk confirmed the robotaxi launch, while social media influencers shared videos of their inaugural rides. The pilot is considered a key step toward Musk's broader vision of autonomous mobility as a major revenue driver for the company.A small fleet of around 10 Tesla vehicles was seen operating in the South Congress area without a driver, but a passenger in the front seat acting as a safety monitor. However, the extent of their control over the vehicles remains unclear. Tesla had invited a select group of influencers to participate in the trial, which was tightly controlled and restricted to a specific area. Per Musk’s post on X, rides were priced at a flat rate of $4.20.As the launch approached, Texas lawmakers passed new legislation regulating autonomous vehicles. Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring companies to obtain state permits to operate driverless cars. The law, set to take effect on Sept. 1, 2025, indicates that state leaders from both political parties are urging the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed with caution.Tesla’s high-profile launch comes as other players in the space are also racing to expand robotaxi services. However, with rising regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns — highlighted by Texas’ new permit law — industry momentum remains uncertain. TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..Zoox, Amazon’s AMZN autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has opened its first dedicated robotaxi manufacturing facility in California, marking a key step toward launching its commercial self-driving taxi service in the United States. Amazon Zoox is actively testing a fleet of more than 20 driverless vehicles in various American cities. In San Francisco, operations are currently focused on the South of Market district. Amazon Zoox plans to soon offer test rides to the public.Alphabet’s GOOGL self-driving division, Waymo, announced that it will restart autonomous vehicle testing in New York City next month as part of a broader strategy to expand its operations nationwide. The Alphabet subsidiary views New York’s dense and dynamic urban landscape as an essential proving ground for its technology. Waymo remains the only U.S. firm offering a commercial robotaxi service to paying passengers.

111,2025-06-23 21:02:00,The Google exec who oversaw $66.9 billion in ad revenue so far this year says AI is ‘changing the game on what is possible’,Vidhya Srinivasan led Amazon Web Services' first cloud data centers launches before taking on a pivotal transformation at Google.,"– AI in advertising. Last year, at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Google exec Vidhya Srinivasan remembers a lot of talk about the possibilities of AI in advertising. “People were experimenting with it and thinking about what’s possible,” she recalls. One year later, in the South of France last week, possibility had fully become reality. “It’s actually transforming every aspect of advertising today,” she says..Srinivasan is the person responsible for making much of that transformation happen. At Google, she is VP/GM for both advertising and commerce. She oversees Google Shopping and advertising products across Google Search, maps, YouTube, and more—a vast portfolio of fast-changing products with more than $66.9 billion in revenues in Q1 alone..Srinivasan added commerce to her portfolio at the beginning of this year, a remit she took on as consumers demand hyper-personalization while shopping, and as advertisers seek it as they target shoppers..AI in advertising and commerce can mean wildly different things. It’s a vast portfolio of ad tech products and rapidly AI-generated, targeted advertising. “We’ve always wanted to serve the right ad to the right person at the right time…Now you can come up with a perfect creative at the moment for the person, because the AI is able to generate things on the fly,” she says. “It’s changing the game on what is possible in any given moment.”.It’s also an entirely new shopping experience—a consumer can describe a garment they might want, see an AI-generated version, and then shop for similar products that already exist. “Customer journeys are completely unpredictable,” Srinivasan says. “Users now want a far more relevant, immersive experience in everything they do.”.Adweek last year described Srinivasan as having the “toughest job in advertising.” She’s at the center of a lot of trends: fast-changing activity on Google Search, as more consumers go straight to ChatGPT or other chatbots rather than Google something; advertising anxieties about the future of creative and the industry; and the vast workforce changes that are happening in both sectors..Srnivasan says that her past experience at Amazon Web Services helped prepare her for the challenge. Starting at AWS in 2012, she was tasked with bringing the first cloud data warehouse to market. “The charter was, I should be able to start a data warehouse in the time it takes to get a coffee or buy a book,” she remembers. It seemed impossible at the time. “People were very skeptical that cloud was a real thing when I started there and now, of course, you look back and you’re like, ‘Of course that had to happen.'”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-exec-oversaw-66-9-130243906.html,"```json

Together, they make up the “Prominent 10.""","Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S..It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy..Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%..Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI..But what about China?.Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services..Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years..The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users.

I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence..On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights....1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300."".CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power..This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines..And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth..If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.).For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare..Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each..And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI..I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed..Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-085200107.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Is Google at risk of losing its online discovery crown to ChatGPT?.Well, not yet..As you can see in this overview of online search traffic, put together by the team at Visual Capitalist, OpenAI’s chatbot still lags Google by a significant margin, and with Google also incorporating its own AI answers, it may still be able to fend off rising competition from ChatGPT, and maintain its place as king of the heap..Based on data presented which was presented by NP Digital at Web Summit 2025, Google still leads the way in overall web search activity, facilitating some 13.7 billion searches per day. Instagram comes in second (6.5 billion searches per day), though interestingly, Snapchat and LinkedIn also rank high for daily search activity, higher than Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing and Pinterest..I would have assumed that all of these would see more search activity than Snap, but NP Digital says that the data has been sourced from multiple sources. Which could also point to variances in tracking process..Either way, the topline note is that ChatGPT still has a long way to go to become the key search engine, though it is growing fast, and as more and more people converse with AI chatbots, it's quickly becoming a more habitual search process..Recommended Reading .Google Highlights Top Halloween Search Trends",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-catching-google-search-activity-205430327.html,"```json

119,2025-06-22 22:01:00,Nvidia: How the chipmaker evolved from a gaming startup to an AI giant,"Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI.","Over the past two decades, Nvidia (NVDA) has skyrocketed into global conversation..The semiconductor company is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)..Beyond its strengths in the gaming, data, and AI fields, Nvidia announced plans this March for a quantum research center in Boston, where CEO Jensen Huang said researchers could tackle problems from drug discovery to materials development..Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI..On April 5, 1993, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia with an initial focus on designing and producing 3D graphics processors for computing and video games..The company’s first product release, the multimedia processor NV1, didn’t get the reception the founders were hoping for. What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html,"```json

The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years.","Amazon has a clear path toward a $3 trillion market cap through its cloud computing growth and AI investments..While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years..The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.While not all have stayed there, there have been three tech giants that have crossed the $3 trillion market cap threshold: Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html,"```json

Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI.  Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead.","Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure..Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI..Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world we live in, making it a must-invest sector..Let's look at 10 AI stocks to invest in right now..The king of AI, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their fast processing speeds. However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083000803.html,"```json

124,2025-06-22 06:05:00,Is OpenAI's Deal With Alphabet a Game Changer?,OpenAI just teamed up with Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform.,"For the last couple of years, OpenAI has relied heavily on Microsoft to supply compute power through the Azure cloud platform..Recently, OpenAI has been exploring new cloud partnerships with Oracle and now Google in an effort to migrate away from Microsoft..Teaming up with OpenAI could be a transformative move for Alphabet as its core search business continues to face pressure..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.For more than two years now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company has raised billions in funding from Microsoft, works closely with leading AI-focused cloud providers such as CoreWeave, and is among the key players pushing a $500 billion domestic AI infrastructure initiative called Project Stargate..Recently, OpenAI found itself in the headlines yet again following news of a major partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)..Let's explore how OpenAI and Alphabet are teaming up, and assess why this deal could be a game changer..Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital. As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure..While Azure's infrastructure has been key to OpenAI maintaining explosive growth over the last two years, recent moves from the ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft..For instance, as part of Project Stargate, Oracle is reportedly exploring purchasing several billion dollars worth of Nvidia's newest Blackwell GPU architecture and leasing access to these chips to OpenAI..According to recent reporting, OpenAI's partnership with Alphabet revolves around the same use case as the Oracle deal: accessing compute power through the Google Cloud Platform. As data workloads continue to rise, training and inferencing AI models becomes increasingly sophisticated and costly. Hence, broadening its cloud compute infrastructure beyond Azure is critical for OpenAI..While cloud computing has emerged as a fast-growing business for Alphabet, Google Cloud operates at a much smaller scale than Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). That said, working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business and AI efforts..However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-deal-alphabet-game-changer-220500302.html,"```json

Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same. So, which company is better placed to thrive in the future?.Tesla's launch of its full-self-driving (FSD) robotaxi is sometimes seen as a tactical move as its electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share come under pressure in 2025, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that major automakers, including Ford, and leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving, and it's an integral part of the future of the auto industry..The reason behind the investment is a recognition that robotaxis have huge profit potential, not least because they offer a long stream of recurring income from ride-per-mile revenue..Another reality is that EVs are not cheap, and if they are the future of the auto industry, automakers need to make them more affordable. They also need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable..However, don't take my word for it. Here's Ford's CEO Jim Farley in 2019 on autonomous driving and robotaxis: ""The self-driving system is incredibly important to develop, but it's just one part of building a safe and scalable self-driving service that consumers can trust."" Farley went on to outline a timeline for a ""commercial self-driving service"" in 2021, which Ford would fail to achieve..As for affordable EVs, last year, Farley reiterated the need to offer smaller and more affordable EVs to achieve profitability as an EV maker..The two things are strongly connected. You can't have robotaxi EVs if the vehicles aren't affordable. That's a point that resonated during a recent CNBC interview with Waymo, which has a robotaxi service already in place, yet co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana declined to outline a timeline for the company's profitability. Waymo's lack of profitability means its owner, Alphabet, is going to have to invest significant sums, at a loss, if it wants Waymo to build scale. That creates a huge opportunity for a company like Tesla that is just entering the market and potentially offers a much more commercial and scalable service.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-200500011.html,"```json

By examining the engagement metrics and conversion data, the system constantly improves the targeting accuracy and campaign efficiency besides getting insight from user behavior patterns..This exceptional efficiency, which allows advertisers to make more informed bids on ad inventory while publishers to generate more revenue, is based on the system's predictive capabilities. The platform's establishment to process and learn from billions of pieces of data each day creates a significant barrier for other competitors, as it is developed better with more available data. AXON is the neural network that drives the whole platform with deep learning technology, which is used to explore the user data in a way that traditional analysis tools would not be able to. That is to say, this platform is the most modern digital solution that performs the task of reinforcement learning, where the smart algorithms are given real-time feedback with optimal ad placement and bidding decisions generated automatically.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applovin-advertising-giant-making-152035147.html,"```json

He shares his key takeaways from his experiences and why, ultimately, Tesla (TSLA) may have a leg up on the rival..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Waymo, we know, right now Stephen, far ahead. What are Tesla's competitive advantages in this space? When you explain them to clients, or what do you tell them? .Yeah, it's interesting. I've been in, I've been in Waymos and full self-driving Teslas and and, you know, the first thing that that jumped out to me was that the Tesla system felt more, more natural, right, in the process. Now, the, when you look at the Waymo system, and, you know, this is on the vehicles you see in San Francisco and other cities. Uh, or sounds like they're coming to New York at some point in the not too distant future. They have multiple redundancies in the system, right? They have cameras, they have LiDAR, they have radar and they, they because of those redundancies you know if people look at them and say there there's a higher level of safety. When you look at the, the Tesla system, you know, it's camera based and it's AI based, and they have massive quantities of data uh to do the analysis. Uh, to me the vehicles kind of felt a little more natural, but look but what we tell people is you know the lack of redundancies, the camera-based system only. There are some risks to that. Now, on the positive side, there's really three big benefits. Right, one is cost, right, if you're, if you're talking about a, a robotaxi which you're showing on the screen right now or whether we should talk about a Model Y that I that I subscribed to FSD with, you know the car can be $30 or $40,000. A a Waymo fully equipped with all the sensors, etc. is well north of a hundred thousand dollars. So cost is one. Second is uh, I think clearly the massive fleet of Teslas that are out there right now, which can become part of of a robotaxi fleet over time. But if I have a Tesla Model Y in the driveway and I have a you know full self-driving, you know theoretically I can drive that car to work and dump it into the robotaxi fleet. So the ability to scale based on a massive installed base uh is probably the second uh big positive. And, and then the third is their ability, I think, to have some flexibility whether it's uh, you know, some Tesla owned assets, assets owned by by individuals and even, even you know partnering with at some point or even using a you know me having a Tesla and dumping it into an Uber or or a Lyft fleet if I if I so choose. So there's multiple avenues for the company over time. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-vs-waymo-difference-between-120003596.html,"```json

Remember, the movie by the same name doesn't have the happiest of endings, and the tragedy made sense as a metaphor for potential market bubbles. Still, the Magnificent Seven group keeps setting the tone for the overall stock market, and most of these stocks are market darlings in 2025, with double-digit price gains over the last 52 weeks..But Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is lagging behind with a 2% price dip over the last year, and the stock looks downright undervalued in many ways. It's the only Magnificent Seven stock I have bought this year, for one simple reason: It's the best combination of affordable shares and unbeatable artificial intelligence (AI) expertise in this elite group..The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running circles around Google Cloud..But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices. Nvidia stock trades at 47 times earnings and 49 times free cash flows today. Microsoft and Amazon have P/E ratios in the mid-30s and cash flow multiples well above Nvidia's. At the same time, Alphabet stock looks affordable at 19 times earnings and 28 times free cash flows..The numbers never tell the whole story, and there's more to say about Alphabet's long-term growth opportunities. From AI services to quantum computing systems, the company was built to thrive amid ever-changing markets and unexpected economy jolts. But the modest stock valuation is a great starting point for further research..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit.  In the span of only a few years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the largest stocks in the world.","The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia..As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.In the span of only a few years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the largest stocks in the world. Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chips fall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-prediction-someone-invested-110000215.html,"{

That should continue as its CUDA software program has created a wide moat, helping it attain a 92% market share in the GPU space in the first quarter. With AI infrastructure demand continuing to rise, Nvidia is well-positioned for years of continued growth..Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending..While Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips. It projects that its three furthest along customers in this area will be a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity in fiscal 2027 alone. Meanwhile, it has added other big customers since then, including Apple. Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, producing chips for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. Its technological expertise and scale have made it an invaluable part of the semiconductor value chain, allowing it to increase prices and expand margins. As AI infrastructure spending and other chip consumption grows, TSMC is set to be one of the biggest winners in the years ahead..Biggest risks: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending and/or Intel being a more viable competitor..Originally a data-gathering and analytics company serving the U.S government, Palantir Technologies' (NASDAQ: PLTR) AI platform (AIP) has been gaining strong momentum in the U.S. commercial sector. The platform helps organizations gather data from a variety of sources and organize it into an ""ontology"" that connects the data to real-world assets and processes.

Do this instead,"Here are some other, safer ways to verify your identity and sign into your accounts.","Do you receive login security codes for your online accounts via text message? These are the six- or seven-digit numbers sent via SMS that you need to enter along with your password when trying to access your bank accounts, health records, online photos, and more. This type of security is known as multifactor authentication (MFA) and is designed to keep your account secure even if someone knows your password. Without the additional security code, bad actors can’t gain access to your data. Or at least that’s the idea..Most Read from Fast Company.NYC mayoral election live results: 3 ways to follow the high-stakes New York City race in real time.The Trump administration wants to shut down the agency that investigates chemical explosions.Kroger is closing 60 stores: See the list of locations that are reportedly shuttering in 2025 so far.It’s increasingly becoming evident that security codes sent by text message may leave our data less secure than we thought. Fortunately, there are other, more secure ways to keep your accounts safe. Here’s why it’s probably a good idea to stop using SMS for your security codes, and what you can use instead..You may think that the text message you receive with the code you need to log into your account is coming from Amazon, Google, Meta, or whoever provides the service you are logging into. But it’s probably not—and therein lies the security risk..Bloomberg and Lighthouse Reports just released an alarming report revealing that some of the most prominent tech companies recommending that users enable multifactor authentication—including Amazon, Google, and Meta—have used third-party companies to send their security codes to users via text..Some of these third-party companies have been linked to institutions in the surveillance industry and even government spy agencies. Additionally, some of the security codes that these third-party companies were responsible for transmitting have been associated with data breaches of individuals’ accounts. Worse: the intermediaries operating in this space do so with little oversight from their tech giant clients or regulators..And Bloomberg and Lighthouse Reports’ piece isn’t the first to warn about the vulnerability that texted security codes expose users to. In December, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning to the public, urging people to migrate away from receiving security codes via text. “Do not use SMS as a second factor for authentication,” the CISA’s memo warned. “SMS messages are not encrypted—a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-security-codes-ask-receive-090000541.html,"```json

The smartphone and computer giant is down around 10% in the last 12 months, while artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are soaring..Management has made some major missteps in virtual reality and false promises with its Siri and Apple Intelligence services. Revenue is growing slowly, and innovation seems to be lacking for this storied technology brand..Is Apple in trouble? Here's why investors should be concerned about owning shares of this stock..Back in early 2024, Apple released the Vision Pro, an expensive virtual reality headset that it promised was the next evolution in computing. The device sold for $3,500 and had a futuristic ski-goggle look and aimed to replace the personal computer for people working at home. Apple has been researching virtual and augmented reality technologies for years, but this was its first large foray into the cutting-edge computing space..Now in June 2025, the Apple Vision Pro looks like a total flop. The company had to scale back production because of weak demand, failed to attract developers to make applications for the device, and has sold fewer than 1 million devices (reportedly) since its launch. Even if it sold 1 million of these devices a year, that equates to $3.5 billion in annual revenue, compared to $400 billion in consolidated revenue for Apple. The device isn't going to move the needle financially..The Vision Pro can officially be called a flop. New versions may change consumer sentiment, but Apple has failed in its first foray into the virtual reality space. This company is still being driven by the iPhone and iPhone software and services..Speaking of smartphones, Apple has promised customers and investors that new AI-focused updates will be coming to Apple devices shortly. Bullish investors see this as a reason for customers to upgrade their iPhones, which has been a nagging issue for the company, as customers are sticking with older devices for longer..As with the Vision Pro, Apple talked a big game around upgrades for Siri and Apple Intelligence products. However, the actual products released have been lackluster..At its annual developer conference, the company delayed the launch of AI Siri to early next year. At the same time, AI competitors, such as Alphabet and OpenAI, are pushing forward with cutting-edge productivity tools, leaving Apple in the dust.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-trouble-083500043.html,"```json

According to an estimate by McKinsey, the world's economy will need to spend an eye-popping $6.7 trillion by 2030 on data centers to handle the growth in traditional and AI workloads. These data centers will require a tremendous amount of energy to support this surge in computing power. .The digitization investment megatrend will benefit technology companies and power suppliers. Two of the best stocks to invest in right now across those two sectors are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP). Here's what makes them worthy of a $1,000 investment right now..There's a lot of talk that AI could disrupt Alphabet's immensely profitable Google search business. That weighed on the tech titan's valuation. It currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 18.5 times. That's below the market averages (nearly 23 times for the S&P 500 index and about 29.5 times for the Nasdaq-100) and the other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks: .Instead of being a drag on its business, AI is becoming an accelerator. Alphabet developed its own AI model (Gemini). CEO Sundar Pichai noted in the first-quarter earnings press release that its recently rolled out Gemini 2.5 is ""achieving breakthroughs in performance and is an extraordinary foundation for our future innovation."" Alphabet is integrating AI into search with AI overviews. Meanwhile, the company is seeing strong Google Cloud growth (28% revenue growth in the first quarter), partly driven by AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. The company believes its unique full-stack approach to AI, which integrates it on the front end and back end, will empower it to be a leader in the AI age. .Given the company's reasonable valuation, Alphabet could generate robust returns in the coming years. Its strong growth in the past turned a $1,000 investment made 10 years ago into over $6,500 (20.6% annualized total return). .Brookfield Renewable is emerging as a key player in empowering tech companies by providing them with the energy they need to support their cloud and AI growth. For example, Brookfield signed a monster deal last year to support Microsoft's power needs. It plans to develop 10.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy capacity from 2026 to 2030 for the technology titan. That was almost 8 times larger than the biggest corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) ever signed. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-invest-1-000-081500909.html,"```json

And there's good reason for that. His Baupost Group hedge fund returned an average of 20% per year over the first 30 years of its existence. That performance comes despite value stocks falling well out of favor over the last decade..But Klarman and his team emphasize that they ""remain flexible in their application"" of value investing. That means investing in stocks that are mispriced relative to their value, even if they won't show up on any stock screeners for deep value based on traditional metrics. As a result, this method can end up with some stocks that many investors would consider growth stocks, such as those found in the Magnificent Seven..But Klarman only sees one member of the vaunted group of trillion-dollar stocks as worth his and his investors' money, and he just added more of it to Baupost's portfolio..The Magnificent Seven is a group of stocks full of interesting opportunities for the right investor. And anyone who invested in any or all of them is probably happy with their returns over the last couple of years. But a few may not present the value necessary for an investment from someone like Klarman. As a group, they're relatively expensive based on traditional valuation standards..Four of the seven sport forward P/E ratios above 30, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) with its 168 times multiple. While Tesla could prove worth the price with its plans for a robotaxi service and humanoid robots, there's a lot of risk in buying the stock at its current price, especially as its core car business is facing stiff competition abroad. The other high-priced members are growing quickly and on relatively solid footing, but it's hard to argue they're a bargain at their current prices..But one member of the group trades for a valuation below the S&P 500's average, and that's kind of surprising for a stock with such strong growth potential. The stock has consistently traded at or near the lowest valuation of the Magnificent Seven, giving investors plenty of opportunities. That's why Klarman and his team have built up a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), including adding 652,000 more shares in the first quarter, increasing its stake in the company by 46%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-seth-klarman-holds-just-075500478.html,"```json

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock didn't finish the trading week on a high note.  The Google parent company's two listed shares both sank by nearly 4% in price that day, thanks in no small part to a development on the regulatory front.","The company didn't have a good day in a top European court..The court's key advisor recommended that the tech titan's appeal against a large fine be rejected..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock didn't finish the trading week on a high note. The Google parent company's two listed shares both sank by nearly 4% in price that day, thanks in no small part to a development on the regulatory front. Those declines were notably more pronounced than the S&P 500 index's 0.2% slip on the day..Alphabet's key business unit Google is on the hook to pay a 4.1 billion euro ($4.7 billion) fine to the European Union (EU), after it ruled in 2018 that the company actively stifled search engine competition with its Android mobile operating system. The tech giant has, not surprisingly, appealed that fine..That appeal is now pending at the highest court in the EU, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)..In what has to be considered a setback for Google/Alphabet, the CJEU's advocate-general -- the court's top advisory official -- recommended that Google's appeal be dismissed. In her recommendation, Juliane Kokott said that ""Google held a dominant position in several markets of the Android-ecosystem and thus benefited from network effects that enabled it to ensure that users used Google Search."".Although Kokott's recommendations are non-binding, CJEU justices typically accept and follow the advice of the court's advocate-general..Alphabet has not yet publicly commented on this latest development in its appeal..Alphabet did get something of a break with the fine, as it was cut slightly from the original amount of over 4.3 billion euros ($4.9 billion) to the 4.1 billion euros currently hanging over it..The company, sprawling and powerful as it is, can easily afford the fine in the likely case its appeal fails. However, a defeat would illustrate Alphabet's continued vulnerability to anti-competitive lawsuits like the EU's..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years..Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $659,171!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $891,722!*.Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 995% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 172% for the S&P 500.

Shares of Uber Technologies UBER declined on the news due to concerns of future competition in one of the largest ride-hailing markets in the United States..Waymo has applied for the permit to begin testing its self-driving vehicles in Manhattan. The proposed tests would include a trained human specialist in the vehicle to supervise operations. Regardless of whether the permit is granted, Waymo intends to begin collecting data and evaluating its autonomous driving technology in the city from next month..Alphabet’s Waymo already offers fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services in several major U.S. cities, having achieved significant milestones in the industry. However, Waymo faces substantial regulatory barriers in New York, with current state laws not permitting fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing services..We do not expect Waymo’s move to apply for a testing permit in the densely populated New York City to have much of an adverse impact on Uber’s prospects as feared. Ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft LYFT have successfully navigated complex regulatory relationships with the city. Shares of Lyft also fell on the move by Alphabet’s autonomous driving platform, on concerns about future competition for ride-hailing companies..Uber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. The ride-hailing giant has a partnership with Waymo, too, in this regard. By adopting this approach, Uber has avoided the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. In 2020, Uber sold its self-driving division but retained focus on becoming the ultimate ride-hailing super app..Uber’s dominant market share in the ride-hailing industry also gives it a unique advantage in the lucrative robotaxi market. With its vast network of drivers and customers, Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures. Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners, giving users a variety of options..Lyft is also aiming to be a key player in the lucrative and emerging autonomous vehicle market, highlighting the immense competition in the space. The global robotaxi market is projected to reach $45.7 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 91.8% from 2025 to 2034..Shares of UBER have gained 34.9% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s 9.5% decline in the same timeframe.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-applies-nyc-testing-permit-142800976.html,"```json

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has earned considerable returns since its initial public offering (IPO).  The Google parent began trading on Aug. 19, 2004.","Alphabet stock has traded for almost 21 years..Despite massive gains during that time, it holds far more potential for growth..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has earned considerable returns since its initial public offering (IPO). The Google parent began trading on Aug. 19, 2004. It has transformed many parts of the tech industry and earned its place among the ""Magnificent Seven."".Still, despite Alphabet's influence on tech, investors rarely examine this stock over a 21-year time span. For that reason, the amount of growth may come as a surprise to many investors..If one invested $5,000 at the pre-split price of $85 per share, there would have be 58 pre-split shares in that revamped position. A 2-for-1 stock split in March 2014 added another 58 shares under the company's second ticker, and a later 20-for-1 split for both tickers in 2022 took the share count to 2,320. Today, those shares are worth around $410.000..Additionally, the stock began paying dividends in the middle of 2024. That added more than $2,300, taking the total to approximately $412,300..During that time, Alphabet drove its growth primarily in the digital advertising market through Google searches and platforms like YouTube. Moreover, it invested in numerous businesses. Most have not contributed significantly to the top line, and advertising still makes up around 74% of the company's revenue as of the first quarter of 2025..Nonetheless, a few non-ad businesses have begun to emerge. With that, Google Cloud now makes up 14% of the company's revenue. Furthermore, a recent funding round valued Waymo, its autonomous driving business, at $45 billion. Thus, as self-driving technology goes mainstream, it could become a major contributor to Alphabet's revenue..Ultimately, with Waymo, Google Cloud, and other businesses, Alphabet retains significant potential for future growth. When also considering that digital ad revenue continues to rise by double-digit rates, the Google parent's growth story is likely to continue for a long time to come..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years..Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $659,171!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $891,722!*.Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 995% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 172% for the S&P 500.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA..Juliane Kokott, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice, advised on Thursday that the court uphold a lower ruling that had already trimmed the penalty from 4.34 billion. The opinion, though non-binding, often influences the court's final decision..The penalty stems from a long-running EU antitrust case, which accuses Google of using its Android mobile operating system to unfairly push its own apps through pre-installation deals with phone makers. The European Commission initially imposed the fine in 2018, citing anti-competitive practices..A spokesperson for Google expressed disappointment over the opinion and argued the ruling could discourage innovation in open platforms and affect Android users and developers..The final decision from the ECJ is expected in the coming months. While the court is not obligated to follow Kokott's advice, it historically aligns with advocate general recommendations in most cases..Based on the one year price targets offered by 49 analysts, the average target price for Alphabet Inc is $201.74 with a high estimate of $250.00 and a low estimate of $160.00. The average target implies a upside of +16.40% from the current price of $173.32..Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Alphabet Inc in one year is $197.50, suggesting a upside of +13.95% from the current price of $173.32..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-faces-setback-4-7b-120647323.html,"```json

155,2025-06-20 19:30:00,Nvidia Is Quickly Approaching a New Record High. Is It Too Late to Buy NVDA Stock?,Nvidia’s share price has found its mojo back after an indifferent start to the year.,"As the market remains vulnerable to a plethora of uncertainties, it seems that there is one constant: the dominance of chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). The stock, which took a tumble due to China-related issues, primarily related to the emergence of DeepSeek and new tariffs under President Donald Trump, has made a strong comeback and is just about 5% off from its record highs..Touted as the “Godfather of AI” by celebrated tech analyst Dan Ives, CEO Jensen Huang and his company are critical to not only the U.S.’s global prowess in chips, but are increasingly becoming key to diplomatic negotiations..2 Outstanding Stocks Under $50 to Buy and Hold Now.3 ETFs with Dividend Yields of 12% or Higher for Your Income Portfolio.Nvidia’s Bringing Sovereign AI to Germany.

Sign Up Now!.Have investors looking to add Nvidia to their portfolios missed the train, or is there still time to load up on the stock, which is up 8.3% on a YTD basis? Let’s find out..Not even a decade ago, Nvidia was a niche company, mostly popular among gamers for its GPUs. Now, after 10 years its shares have soared more than 28,000%, driving the company to a valuation above $3.5 trillion. Nvidia is also closing in on new record highs as it is just 5% shy of the record $153.13 set early in January..The company that designs and sells advanced chips and software platforms — primarily for AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous systems – counts tech majors such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and nearly every major AI and cloud company as its customer..From hyperscalers to sovereign AI, Nvidia is becoming more and more irreplaceable. Central to this are Nvidia’s Blackwell chips..According to Huang’s keynote at GTC 2025, “The Blackwell architecture significantly enhances AI model training and inference, enabling more efficient and scalable AI applications. And the next evolution of the Nvidia Blackwell AI factory platform, Blackwell Ultra, will be coming to systems in the second half of this year.”.Further bolstering its dominance in the GPU industry, where it already commands a near-monopoly with a-greater-than-90% market share, Nvidia has outlined a compelling product roadmap that is expected to reinforce its leadership position even more firmly. In addition to the Blackwell Ultra platform, the company is progressing toward launching next-generation GPU systems such as the Vera Rubin NVL144, which is anticipated in the second half of 2026, and the Rubin Ultra NVL576, scheduled for release a year later in late 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-quickly-approaching-record-high-113002880.html,"```json

The technology has clear advantages and important limitations..Here are some details of how it works:.WHAT IS TELEOPERATION?.Teleoperation is the control of machines by humans in a different location, usually over a wireless network..It is used to train robots to operate autonomously, monitor their autonomous activity, and take over when required..HOW DO ROBOTAXI OPERATORS USE TELEOPERATION?.The global robotaxi industry is still in test mode, as companies deploy the vehicles in limited geographic areas and continually adjust the artificial intelligence software that controls them. Teleoperation is often used to intervene when a vehicle is unsure of what to do..Alphabet's Waymo, for example, has a team of human ""fleet response"" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver - its bot..""Much like phone-a-friend, when the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information,"" Waymo said in a blog post last year..Former Waymo CEO John Krafcik told Reuters, ""the cars aren't being actively monitored,"" adding that the software is ""the ultimate decision-maker."".A Waymo video shows a car asking a remote operator whether a street with emergency response vehicles is open to traffic. When the human says yes, the vehicle proceeds..In contrast, other companies, such as Baidu's Apollo Go in China, have used fully remote backup drivers who can step in to virtually drive the vehicles. Baidu declined to comment..WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS?.Driving vehicles remotely on public roads has a major potential problem: it relies on cellular data connections that can drop or operate with a lag, disconnecting the vehicle from the remote driver in dangerous situations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-tesla-expected-remotely-control-102154515.html,"```json

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) doesn't get the same respect as its big tech peers.  There is a lot of pessimism that Alphabet's primary cash cow, the Google search engine, could be losing its dominance, threatening the company as we know it today.","Generative AI is challenging Alphabet's Google search business..The company's financial results have remained strong despite this rising competitor..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) doesn't get the same respect as its big tech peers. These stocks all trade at a premium to the market, as measured by the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), while Alphabet does not. There is a lot of pessimism that Alphabet's primary cash cow, the Google search engine, could be losing its dominance, threatening the company as we know it today..However, the numbers don't back this up. Google Search is still dominant and making a ton of money. Because of Alphabet's strong financial picture and cheap price, it's an excellent stock to load up on right now..Most of the concern about Alphabet losing market share involves users switching to alternatives, such as generative AI models. Regardless of which one they use, each time a generative AI model is asked a question, it is one time that Google isn't able to place ads in front of a user. This threatens a core part of the company's business because it gets 56% of its revenue from search..We've seen Google's market share slip a bit, dropping below 90% for the first time since 2015 earlier this year. Still, this doesn't mean the financial picture is trending in the wrong direction, as Google Search revenue rose 10% year over year in the first quarter..One thing helping Google maintain its position is the introduction of AI search overviews, which bridge the gap between a traditional Google search and using a generative AI model. Management has discussed how popular the feature is, and it is going to continue developing it..Although the forecast for Google's market share isn't particularly great, it's still doing an excellent job with its business. I think the market is underestimating the fact that most consumers aren't going to switch away from Google unless something much better is launched. This will protect Alphabet's mindshare and ensure that it continues producing solid results..The first quarter's results were truly fantastic and did not indicate a company that was struggling at all..In that quarter, overall revenue increased 12% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 49% year over year. If all I presented were those growth rates and its valuation, you would think it's an incredibly undervalued stock. But because Alphabet's name is attached to the stock, it trades at a hefty discount to the market and its peers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-im-buying-alphabet-093000424.html,"```json

158,2025-06-20 16:20:00,2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,Both of these stocks will benefit from increased AI spending in the years to come.,"The growth in AI spending is not slowing down, presenting an opportunity for cloud computing stocks..Amazon is the leading cloud provider and is seeing fast revenue growth..Alphabet can benefit from both consumer and cloud AI in the future..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.The artificial intelligence (AI) train shows no signs of slowing down. Spending on the category is expected to grow 5x over the next five years, according to a recent report from Grand View Research. That increased AI spending has been and will continue to be a boon for the cloud computing giants. That's because start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic perform AI model training and run inference for consumer usage through cloud computing systems. And huge capital expenditures on data centers should help growth continue at this blistering pace in 2025..But who are the cloud computing giants benefiting from this AI surge? Two of them happen to be well-known for other reasons and have a history of being millionaire-maker stocks. Here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can continue to be millionaire-maker stocks going forward with the help of AI and the cloud..Amazon is making investments on the consumer side of AI with its e-commerce platform, but the majority of its investments are with its cloud computing division, called Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the premier partner for Anthropic, one of the leading start-ups in the AI space, where Amazon has invested billions of dollars. With these investments, Anthropic will pour money into training and running AI systems on AWS. A long-term partnership such as this will be vital for AWS. Anthropic may spend tens of billions of dollars on cloud computing credits in the years to come..Revenue growth accelerated for AWS in recent quarters as companies flock to the cloud computing leader to host their AI systems. AWS revenue grew 17% year over year last quarter to $29.3 billion, bringing annualized revenue to $117 billion. Profits are soaring because of this spending, sending operating income to $42 billion over the last 12 months just for the AWS segment..Growth should continue in 2025 and beyond. Amazon said it plans to spend $100 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, mostly related to AI at AWS. This increased data center capacity will help revenue keep scaling at a rapid clip. Accompanied by strong profit margins, this will be a huge earnings growth driver for Amazon over the next few years..Add in the durable growth in e-commerce, and Amazon stock looks like a perfect stock to own over the long term. It has a slightly expensive forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35, but that should come down quickly with better margins at e-commerce and steady growth at AWS. Buy Amazon stock and sit tight; you likely will be well rewarded in the future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-millionaire-maker-artificial-intelligence-082000858.html,"```json

The two companies have already partnered in Phoenix, Austin, and soon Atlanta..Analysts led by John Colantuoni note that in Austin, Uber “disclosed the average AV completes more Trips per day than 99% of local drivers,” pointing to the efficiency AVs can deliver on an established platform..“We believe success in these markets demonstrates the long-term value UBER offers to AV developers and could help earn a partnership with Waymo in NYC,” they added..Uber’s deep roots in the city could be a key asset in navigating both regulation and market entry, with Jefferies estimating the company derives a low single-digit percentage of gross bookings from New York..The analysts see Uber as the “most likely consolidator of AV demand,” thanks to its scale and ability to assist AV developers in areas ranging from logistics and pricing to fleet management..Related articles.Uber would be a ’natural strategic partner for Waymo in NYC’: Jefferies.Who are the stock market winners and losers from the Israel-Iran conflict.Stellantis reportedly considering potential sale of luxury brand Maserati",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-natural-strategic-partner-waymo-070528226.html,"```json

The findings also potentially allow other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s lead as countries around the world grapple with ways to protect children from harmful content online..“Age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective,” the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial said in a statement Friday announcing its preliminary findings..The trial’s project director, Tony Allen, said there were “no significant technological barriers” to stopping under-16s gaining social media accounts. “These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said..Under the new law, digital platforms including Snapchat, Meta-owned Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches..The trial tested a range of methods and technologies, including facial scans, inferring a user’s age based on their behavior, age verification, as well as parental controls. The tests also took into account the ways teenagers might try to circumvent age checks..“We found a plethora of approaches that fit different use cases in different ways, but we didn’t find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,” the trial said in its statement..More than 50 companies participated in the trial, while Apple Inc. and Google, developers of the most popular mobile-phone operating systems, are also contributing, Allen said on a video conference call on Friday..The trial didn’t assess public acceptance for any particular technology or the costs involved. The accuracy of the different methods, for example the margin of error for facial analysis, wasn’t made available.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-moves-closer-011443922.html,"```json

164,2025-06-20 03:15:00,Alphabet Lags 'Magnificent 7--But AI Breakthrough Could Be the Game-Changer,Alphabet's Grip on Search Holds Tight as AI Rivals Circle,"June 19 - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) hasn't kept pace with its Magnificent Seven peers lately, its stock dipped 2% over the past year and down nearly 8% so far in 2025. Investors have been jittery about rising AI competition and what it might mean for Google's search ad dominance..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN..But peel back the headlines, and Google still runs the show. Search remains sticky, really sticky. Even when paid to switch to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, most users went right back to Google, according to a recent Wharton study. It's not just brand loyalty, it's decades of data, personal preferences, and deep integration across products like Maps, YouTube, and Chrome that make switching feel like a downgrade..And while ChatGPT and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) AI are gaining ground, Google's own Gemini platform is catching up fast. It now has 350 million monthly users, skyrocketing from just 9 million last October thanks to rollout across Gmail and Search. Behind the scenes, Alphabet's in-house TPUs give it a serious cost advantage over AI players relying on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) pricey chips..On the numbers side, Alphabet looks solid. Revenue grew 13% over the past 12 months through March, with operating margins climbing to nearly 33%. Google Cloud led the way with 30% growth and major margin gains. The company pulled in nearly $73 billion in free cash flow last year and returned $62 billion via stock buybacks..Spending is ramping up, too, capital expenditures are expected to jump 43% this year to $75 billion, mostly to support AI and cloud infrastructure. On the regulatory front, Alphabet is battling several antitrust cases, but a forced breakup of Chrome or ad tech looks like a long shot..Trading at just under 18 times estimated 2026 earnings, Alphabet looks cheap compared to its big-tech peers.

166,2025-06-20 01:36:00,"The Week in AI: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked.""","A new civil war in AI, Andreessen's rant, and Zuck splashes the pot.","Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.""CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA NVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in ""the revolution"" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up after Apple AAPL researchers released their paper ""The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.""We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models ""give up"" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply ""token prediction"" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the ""vibe-coding"" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the ""limitations"" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled ""The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking."" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the ""top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted"" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article ""This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.""And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work ""as fast as possible""...""Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.""Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the ""Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.""I have several posts in the comments of the ""The Week in AI"" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.""Translation: AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: ""The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle."" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled ""The Gentle Singularity.""I call it his ""love letter"" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a ""symbiosis between people and AI"" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of ""post-labor economics"" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the ""not-so-gentle"" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be ""hip.""On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing that Alphabet GOOGL is ""firing on all cylinders across AI"" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last ""search is dead"" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta Platforms META plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be ""mined and modeled"" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough, Advanced Micro Devices AMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...""The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?""It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.""I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer ""thinking."" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other ""intelligence experts"" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line: To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

167,2025-06-20 00:12:00,Meta Platforms vs. Alphabet: Which Digital Ad Behemoth Has an Edge?,"Given increasing spending on digital ads, META or GOOGL, which ad behemoth is leading now?","Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL are behemoths of the digital advertising market, generating billions of dollars in revenues. In the first quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ advertising revenues increased 16.2% year over year to $42.3 billion, driven by a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% increase in average ad price. Meanwhile, Alphabet reported revenues of $66.9 billion, up 8.5% year over year, driven by 9.8% growth in Search revenues and 10.3% growth in YouTube ad revenues. According to eMarketer’s latest projection, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are expected to hit revenues of $209.15 billion (Facebook $116.53 billion and Instagram $67.27 billion) and $183.8 billion (Google $189.74 billion and YouTube $19.42 billion), respectively. Higher tariffs are expected to hurt digital ad spending, which is expected to increase at least 1.5% year over year in 2025. Per the latest dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts report, global ad spending is expected to grow 4.9% in 2025 to hit $992 billion, while digital ad spend is anticipated to grow 7.9% to $678.7 billion. This bodes well for both Alphabet and Meta Platforms.However, macroeconomic challenges, including tariffs and increasing regulatory headwinds, are a concern for both. Meta Platforms shares have outperformed Alphabet year to date. While META shares have appreciated 18.8%, Alphabet has dropped 8.5%.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .So, META or GOOGL, which has an edge now?.Meta Platforms’ focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending has been a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META become better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on integrating AI into its platforms — Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Threads — is driving user engagement to boost ad revenues. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement.These factors are expected to drive Meta Platforms’ top-line growth. Our model expects META’s revenues to grow 11.9% year over year in 2025, with advertising revenues (97.6% of revenues) projected to increase 11.8% year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-vs-alphabet-digital-161200830.html,"```json

168,2025-06-19 21:30:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,"Based on the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), Alphabet (GOOGL) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alphabet (GOOGL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>.While the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

169,2025-06-19 21:30:00,Brokers Suggest Investing in Alphabet (GOOG): Read This Before Placing a Bet,"According to the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), one should invest in Alphabet (GOOG). It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)..Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 53 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 53 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 41 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.4% and 7.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>.While the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias.

170,2025-06-19 19:17:00,3 Growth Stocks to Buy and Forget About,Looking for stocks you can buy and hold for the long haul? See which growth stocks you can trust to do the heavy lifting.,"Alphabet continues to innovate and adapt for long-term growth..Fiverr has huge growth potential despite recent share price struggles..Netflix has rewarded patient investors with outstanding returns, and keeps coming up with better business plans..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.The best growth stocks are the ones you can just forget about. Buy them once and leave them alone. The road ahead may be bumpy, but these companies should be able to overcome their challenges in the long run. And since many investors don't have this unshakable long-term perspective, the stocks may be undervalued from time to time..Here are some of these cruise-control growth stocks from my own portfolio. Some of them are cheap these days and others aren't, but I'd be happy to start brand new positions in all of them today. Except I can't, because I already own them and have no plans to sell my shares anytime soon..I bought my first Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) share in December 2010, when the company still was called Google. By June 17, 2025, those stubs have gained 1,065%. I'm not complaining..If anything, I only wish I had picked up some Google stock even earlier. The trillion-dollar tech giant you see today was once a little upstart with advanced technology and big ambitions. The company's mission is still to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,"" and that's a goal without a time limit..Alphabet is both very profitable and extremely flexible. That rare combination sets the company up for decades of continued business growth. The Alphabet you see in 2040 or 2050 may look very different from the online search and advertising specialist you've seen so far, and that's alright. This company does more than simply rolling with the market's punches -- Alphabet usually leads the charge into whatever new era comes next, such as high-powered smartphones and artificial intelligence (AI)..Freelance services facilitator Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR) is a different story. My first Fiverr share has fallen a hair-raising 87% since January 2021, and the best performer among five additions to my position is down by 27% in three years..So the stock is struggling, but have you seen Fiverr's financial results? Here's a taste of its steady revenue growth and skyrocketing cash flows over the past three years:.Top-line sales increased by 24% over this period while free cash flows tripled. I keep coming back to this stock whenever I have fresh cash to invest, because it often looks undervalued.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-buy-forget-111700773.html,"```json

What's unique, however, is that the usual suspects of Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon aren't really pegged to the rising interest in quantum computing technology..Rather, a new cohort of rising stars such as Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) are among the most popular quantum computing stocks right now. With shares down by 25% from their peak over the last year, IonQ stock trades for roughly $40 as of this writing. Is now a good opportunity to pounce on the stock?.Quantum computing is not a widely used application in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Yet despite its developmental stage, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that quantum computing could be a $131 billion opportunity in the coming decades. With the potential for such enormous upside, it's not entirely surprising that investors were quick to look at which companies are involved with quantum computing development..One reason that I think IonQ has emerged as a favorite in the quantum computing market is the company's impressive partnerships with cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. With the stock sliding as of late, investors may be wondering if the sell-off is an opportunity to buy the dip..Despite working with major AI developers, IonQ has little to show in terms of tangible growth. Over the last year, the company has only generated $43 million in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's net losses are in the hundreds of millions (and worsening)..In a way, this financial profile actually makes some sense. As I alluded to above, quantum computing is not yet commercially used in AI development. Given those dynamics, IonQ's revenue potential is fairly limited for the time being. The unfortunate reality is that the company will likely remain a high-cash-burn operation as it continues building out its platform..But still, for just $40 could IonQ be worth a look? Well, smart investors understand that the stock price alone does not determine the worth of a business. As of this writing, IonQ boasts a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. This implies that IonQ is trading for a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 195.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-25-now-time-pounce-110000459.html,"```json

The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

Some focus on valuation. Others prioritize growth potential. A few look for arbitrage opportunities..But there's at least one common denominator among many ultrarich investors these days: They like artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Billionaires are buying these three AI stocks hand over fist..Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stands out as a top pick for several billionaire investors. Izzy Englander might be the most bullish about the tech stock. His Millennium Management hedge fund upped its position in Alphabet by 150.8% in the first quarter of 2025..Ken Griffin is another billionaire hedge fund manager who's enthusiastic about Alphabet stock. His Citadel Advisors increased its stake in the tech giant by 55.7% in Q1.

Its valuation is probably near the top of the list. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 19. None of the other so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks comes anywhere close to such an attractive valuation..Alphabet has also been showing that it's playing to win in the AI space. The company's Google Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks No. 1 overall on the LMArena leaderboard. Google Cloud continues to be the fastest-growing of the top three cloud service providers..There isn't as much of a consensus among billionaire investors when it comes to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

But that doesn't mean there aren't good values to be found. While there are some fears that a bubble will form in AI, many of the big tech stocks leading the charge look downright undervalued. In fact, some of them even fall into the classic Warren Buffett model of value investing..Buffett is known for avoiding tech stocks for most of his career, but there are some AI-related tech stocks that even a value investor like him could get behind. Keep reading for details about two of them..OpenAI may be the most buzzworthy AI company, but there's no question that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a leader in AI.

Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in..It's true that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity pose a threat to Google Search, but thus far, Google has held its own, continuing to grow..In fact, growth in the business has been steady, and Google Cloud has also turned profitable.

Alphabet and Meta Platforms are the biggest winners in the industry, but there are others benefiting as well, including ad tech companies taking advantage of continued growth in areas such as connected TV, retail media, better ad targeting, and improvements enabled by AI..Keep reading for more details on two of these ad tech stocks that can make investors a fortune..There's no getting around it: Roku's (NASDAQ: ROKU) performance disappointed investors in recent years. Roku's stock price remains down more than 80% from its peak in 2021. That's when the pandemic-driven boom quickly faded as the economy reopened and the streaming industry's surging growth hit a wall..Roku was forced to do several rounds of layoffs, having overspent during the pandemic. But the business and the streaming industry more broadly underwent a reset and are prepared for growth. Netflix's stock soared to an all-time high recently as its ad tier has taken off. Walt Disney is now making a profit in its streaming division, and the stock recently hit a 52-week high, while Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, one focused on studios and the other on streaming..Streaming services appear to be moving past their post-pandemic struggles, and Roku should benefit. Despite the stock's woes, the business continues to deliver solid growth, with revenue up 16% year over year in the first quarter to $1.02 billion, and its bottom line is improving as well. The company also expects to report an operating profit using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) metrics..There are also other signs of building momentum. The stock price jumped on Monday after the company announced an exclusive integration with Amazon's demand side platform, and it's also gaining share of listings on retail sites such as Amazon and Target, a sign that it's probably gaining market share as well..As the leading streaming distribution platform, Roku is well-positioned to capitalize on continued growth in connected TV, and at a market cap of $11 billion, the stock could easily double, triple, or better from here, especially if it hits its profit goal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ad-tech-stocks-could-080000461.html,"```json

While the S&P 500 index is up 97% over the last five years, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 has gained 133%. And there are plenty of tech companies that have done even better than that..If you have $5,000 you're ready to invest now, you could open solid starting positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ)..Let's take a look at each of these tech leaders to see what makes them stand out..Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the biggest recent development in the tech sector. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the main third-party manufacturer of semiconductors (chips) worldwide, and it produces an outsized share of the cutting-edge AI processors that are in high demand..TSMC's share of the global semiconductor market grew from 58% in the second quarter of 2023 to 67% by the end of last year, according to research firm Counterpoint. Second-place foundry services provider Samsung had just 11%..TSMC makes chips designed by many top tech companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. Their partnerships with TSMC are crucial to their operations..Surging demand for chips made using the most advanced process nodes has been good for TSMC's bottom line. It reported net income of $11.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 60% year-over-year increase. But what makes it attractive as an investment is that shares are still trading at reasonable valuations, especially compared to other AI stocks. As you can see in the chart below, TSMC is currently much cheaper than companies like Broadcom and Nvidia, based on forward P/E ratio..TSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts..Alphabet is best known for owning Google, which captures about 90% of the online search market. That's just one of its many widely used products and services, however. Others include Google Maps and Waze, the Pixel line of smartphones, Android (the top mobile operating system by market share), and Chrome (the most-used browser)..The most exciting part for growth-focused investors is Alphabet's developments in AI. The company's AI assistant, Google Gemini, is getting positive feedback from users and is currently third in market share. It's still far behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, but given how successful Alphabet has been in dominating other markets, I expect it to capture a much larger slice of the AI space.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-5-000-3-tech-074000906.html,"```json

(NASDAQ:GOOG). The case began with Cofeco’s claim that Google forces advertisers to operate through its services across both search and third-party sites. If the claim had been true, it would have meant that Google gained an unfair advantage over its competitors in the digital advertising sector. The unfair advantage was claimed to stem from the design of Google’s platform for buying online advertising..everything possible/Shutterstock.com.This relieves Google of paying up to 8% of its annual revenue from Mexico as a fine. The scale of this potential antitrust fine can be understood from Google’s revenue from Latin America for 2024, which totals over $20 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best advertising agency stocks to buy right now..In response to this update, a Google spokesperson stated:.“We appreciate COFECE’s decision recognizing that our products give advertisers the freedom and control to use our tools in the ways that best suit their needs.”.While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Push for 10-Year Regulatory Freeze",A secretive AI lobbying blitz backed by tech giants could silence state laws--and reshape the future of innovation,"Big Tech is making a big betand investors are watching. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pushing for a 10-year nationwide ban that would block U.S. states from regulating artificial intelligence. The proposal, already tucked into the House version of Trump's budget bill, is being sold as a way to avoid a messy patchwork of state-level rules that could slow innovation and leave the U.S. trailing China. Their message: keep regulation federal, uniform, and minimalfor now. The lobbying effort is backed by INCOMPAS, a trade group representing tech heavyweights, which launched the AI Competition Center this year to drive home that point. Chip Pickering, INCOMPAS CEO, said the move is about safeguarding America's lead in AI..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN..But not everyone's buying that narrative. Criticsincluding academics, policy analysts, and even some in Silicon Valleyargue this could be less about innovation and more about locking in dominance. MIT's Max Tegmark called it a power grab, while voices from the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator warned that defanging state oversight now could make AI's societal risks harder to manage later. Even within the GOP, there's friction. Some Republicans like Thom Tillis see the merit in avoiding 50 conflicting rulebooks. Others, like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Josh Hawley, say tying states' hands for a decadewhen no one knows where AI is headedcould backfire hard..The Senate is now weighing how to fit this moratorium into a budget reconciliation bill, which bypasses the need for Democratic votes. Senator Ted Cruz has floated a workaround: cut broadband funding to states that refuse to comply. But the clock is ticking, and the political ground is far from firm. For investors, the outcome could reshape how U.S. AI leaders operateand whether they face a smooth runway or a patchwork of speed bumps..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-ai-takeover-amazon-025609997.html,"```json

On the surface, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence..However, over the last couple of weeks, Tesla stock has started to witness some new life -- save for a brief sell-off following a fleeting tiff between Elon Musk and President Trump..While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback during the second half of the year..Let's explore a major update coming to Tesla soon and understand how this could fuel shares to new all-time highs. Is now the time to pounce on Tesla stock? Read on to find out..Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs. Rather, Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla..Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software. Tesla plans to leverage self-driving software across two applications: offering it as a feature in its cars and building a fleet of robotaxis for ride-hailing services..While the initial launch date for the Tesla Robotaxi was rumored to be June 12, more recent commentary from Musk himself suggests that the first rides will take place in Austin, Texas, later this month (potentially between June 22 and 28)..A successful robotaxi launch represents a transformative shift in Tesla -- from primarily a car manufacturer to more of an AI-powered services provider disrupting ride-hailing, car rentals, or logistics businesses..When it comes to popular stocks in the AI realm, I'm sure cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon come to mind. Moreover, given Nvidia's ongoing rollout of its new Blackwell GPU architecture, the semiconductor king appears well positioned for further growth, too..Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AI capital expenditures (capex) just this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-220000899.html,"```json

We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a memo to employees..“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”.Jassy said Amazon is “using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations” for tasks like inventory management and demand forecasting in its delivery system..The CEO said, because of AI, “We’ll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.” The comments were met with backlash from employees..Some of Amazon's corporate employees are facing an order to relocate closer to their managers and teams, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The mandate would require many of them to move across the US to Seattle, Washington DC and other hubs, its sources said..Meanwhile, Amazon and Microsoft have been spending billions to advance their AI efforts. Amazon has consistently reported higher capital expenditures than its fellow Big Tech “hyperscalers” over the past several years, driven by its investments in AI infrastructure. In 2025, that trend is set to continue..Amazon has projected it will spend roughly $105 billion, much higher than its peers, with the vast majority going to AI infrastructure for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services. Microsoft is set to spend $80 billion in 2025 to build out AI data centers..Amazon and Microsoft have both announced layoffs in recent years. Microsoft laid off 3% of its workforce in May after an upbeat earnings report. Amazon slashed over 27,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, just as Jassy was touting its AI efforts. The company laid off another 100 workers in May amid the CEO's aggressive effort to cut middle management while looking to run Amazon like “the world’s largest startup.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-says-company-will-cut-jobs-amid-ai-boom-its-already-happening-at-microsoft-213847151.html,"```json

The company said it employed some 228,000 employees worldwide as of the end of fiscal 2024, with around 120,000 in the U.S., according to a regulatory filing..Many of Microsoft's big tech peers, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have made similar moves. Just last week, Google extended buyout offers to U.S. employees across the company, expanding the scope of buyout offers earlier in the year..Many tech giants are boosting their investments in AI, squeezing profit margins, and pushing firms to lower headcounts. When Microsoft last reported earnings in April, the company stood by its plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in fiscal 2025; D.A.

Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports the latest on Waymo and VW’s (VWAGY) electric ID. Buzz..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here..Well, Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable, bringing its robo taxi service to the streets of New York City. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian here with more details in the story. I I mean, just personally, I can't wait to get in a Waymo and take it around the city. So is it how quickly is this happening? What's the steps, what are the steps that have to happen? .So, you're saying they apply for a permit to begin tests next month. Now, there'll be a safety driver in the driver seat, so you're not going to be alone in the car, but it should ostensibly drive on its own, like it has in LA, San Francisco, Austin right now. Uh, it should be I mean, I'm I was surprised to hear that they're going to be doing this this soon. I think it's kind of shows you how far the technology's come and how confident they are that they can come to New York City where you have cyclists and pedestrians and just people and you know, bikes everywhere. It's just a kind of a wild scene to think about. But yeah, it's coming here next month and it kind of speaks to their global or their continue expansion, uh more places in LA, more places in San Francisco. So, yeah, this is the next big step for them. .Do we have any line of sight, by the way, I'm just curious, what regulators would have to see, Pras, to get comfortable getting that human out of the car, going full robot? .Yeah, I'm not sure. I believe it's it's that New York does not allow a car to be operated without a driver in the seat. I think it'll kind of maybe show a decent record of safety that'll allow them to change regulations to allow full robo taxi deployment, or as they call unsupervised, uh in in New York. You know, so, as Waymo does this in New York City, Tesla is beginning their robo taxi tests in Austin, but unsupervised, meaning there will be no safety driver in the driver's seat. There'll be a person sitting in the passenger seat and tell operators in case anything needs to be done. So, it's a little bit of a distinction there. A little uh a little odd kind of change, because think about Tesla hasn't proven anything yet from a robo taxi point of view. Where Waymo is being extra careful, uh with that right now. .So you'll get in the car in for the Tesla and somebody will be in the passenger seat already. .In this small test they're doing, yeah. .Interesting. Wasn't there other autonomous tech news today, a Volkswagen backed company? .Yeah, earlier today Volkswagen, uh has this startup called Mio, I think they're called. And basically they came up with this uh, you're looking at it, it's an ID version of their ID Buzz minivan, electric minivan, but but fit for robo taxi use using using um uh different software suite plus sensors, uh plus a sort of bespoke mobility platform that allow operators to buy these vans in bulk and and then then deploy them as robo taxis and Uber will be their partner initially for some parts of the US. So, yeah, this is an interesting concept here. Or it's an actual vehicle that VW is using right now in Hamburg, Germany. And they want to bring it around to the US too. .I like the the paint job on the outside of this. Pras, thank you.

The company announced Wednesday that it has applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation for its vehicles to operate autonomously with a “trained specialist” behind the wheel in Manhattan..Waymo says it does plan to eventually introduce a self-driving service for paid rides in New York City, even if the company doesn’t have a time frame for bringing it to the streets of the nation’s largest and most traffic-ridden city. It called the test “an important step towards one day serving New Yorkers.”.Waymo last deployed its cars in New York in 2021. But that was only a test for data collection and weather testing while a human actually drove the vehicle, the company said..This year’s deployment in the nation’s most congested city will still be a test, but “if the permit is granted, (Waymo) would be (New York City)’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles,” the company said..Shares of Lyft (LYFT) and Uber (UBER) both fell following the announcement..Waymo already provides more than 250,000 paid rides a week without a human driver in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. But it is illegal in New York state to operate a car without a person ready to take control of the vehicle to avoid an accident. Waymo also announced it will begin pushing for a change to that state law. And any company offering a self-driving system officially requires approval from New York City, human driver or not..Waymo has partnered with Uber to provide the service in Phoenix and Austin, and is operating robotaxis itself in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It plans to soon be in Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC. In addition, Tesla has announced plans to start its own “robotaxi” service in Austin this Sunday, with plans to expand to other cities in the “coming months.” Tesla, however has been promising its widespread robotaxi service was only “a year away” since 2019..Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk insists that providing robotaxi services will produce massive profits and an increased share price for his company. But profitable self-driving car services have thus far remained elusive for other providers..Alphabet does not disclose the financial performance of Waymo. But the segment of the company that includes Waymo reported a $4.1 billion loss last year, even as Alphabet poured in $5.6 billion.

194,2025-06-19 01:25:00,Waymo applies for special permit to bring its self-driving cars to New York City,Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable: bringing its robotaxi service to the streets of New York City.,"Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable: bringing its robotaxi service to the streets of New York City next month..""We've applied for a @NYC_DOT permit to drive autonomously with a specialist behind the wheel while we're in the city — a key step to one day serving New Yorkers,"" the Alphabet-backed (GOOG, GOOGL) company said in a post on X..Waymo said it is also advocating for changes to state law to bring its fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future. New York's busy streets, with vehicles, pedestrians, bikers, and all sorts of delivery drivers, are seen as one of the most challenging terrains for a rototaxi operator..Waymo's announcement of a future New York City-based service comes amid a planned nationwide expansion. The company operates in parts of San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin, and just announced it was expanding service in greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area..Tesla (TSLA), which is slated to begin its robotaxi testing in Austin starting next week, will not use safety drivers in its cars when its test begins but will have remote teleoperators available. Two Tesla robotaxis were seen testing in Austin last week, but Tesla employees were sitting in the passenger seat..Waymo, the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 trips per week, counts competitors like Zoox (backed by Amazon (AMZN)), China's Pony AI (PONY) and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla, though none operate in as many regions or perform as many autonomous rides as Waymo. Volkswagen's MOIA revealed its ID. Buzz AD robotaxi in Germany this week. However, its vehicles plan to use other operators' platforms, like Uber, to deploy its vehicles..Waymo's expansion counts on its ability to manufacture more vehicles, which the company said will expand to 2,500 vehicles in the near future. Though that production is much smaller compared to what a traditional automaker like Tesla or VW can produce, Waymo is countering that issue by partnering with manufacturers like Toyota and China's Zeekr..Pras Subramanian is the lead auto reporter for Yahoo Finance.

195,2025-06-19 00:59:00,Waymo has set its robotaxi sights on NYC,Waymo said it's working on a return to New York City and its first step it applying for a permit.,"Waymo said Wednesday it has applied for a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the Alphabet company’s first step in a sticky regulatory process to bring its robotaxis to U.S.’s largest city..Waymo applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate its self-driving Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with a human safety operator behind the wheel in Manhattan. New York’s autonomous vehicle demonstration or testing permit requires a human driver to be able to take over; a $5 million insurance policy; and every test vehicle operator must be adequately trained in the safe operation of the test vehicle..New York law is especially prohibitive of autonomous vehicles. While securing a permit would be notable, Waymo is far from being able to launch commercial operations in the city — or even test without a human safety operator behind the wheel..Still, Waymo is pressing forward and said it’s advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel. The company is also trying to build goodwill in NYC and the state by working with several organizations such as MADD NY, YAI, National Federation of the Blind, and the Bronx Community College..Waymo told TechCrunch it has had positive conversations with lawmakers this year and hopes to keep making progress on regulatory changes. New York law states that any person operating a motor vehicle must have at least one hand (or prosthetic) on the steering mechanism at all times. Changing that wording will be key to Waymo eventually being able to deploy driverless vehicles..Other companies have tried to test in NYC before, including Mobileye and the now shuttered Cruise. But these efforts never materialized beyond a few demonstrations or pilots..Of course, New York City has other challenges beyond regulations. The city is chock-a-block with cars, trucks, delivery vans, bicycles, buses, and, importantly, people, all of whom are scuttling about. San Francisco, one of the markets that Waymo operates in today, is also a bustling city with many of the same challenges. NYC takes that complexity to a factor of 10..Waymo has eyed the massive market of NYC for years. In 2021, the company deployed its now retired Chrysler Pacifica minivans — the first self-driving vehicles in its testing fleet — to manually drive and map Manhattan. The company said at the time that each vehicle would have two people, one to drive and another in the passenger seat to help direct the activity of the driver, monitor the software on the vehicle in real time, evaluate the performance, and log comments.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-set-robotaxi-sights-nyc-165904482.html,"```json

The company expects the plant will create hundreds of jobs in the region as it grows..“The reality is we are just ready,” Zoox Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech on Wednesday. The strategy is to start “putting the capacity in place and then turning it on little by little as we go city by city” with commercial launches, she said..Zoox is one of several companies vying to secure a foothold in the market for autonomous ridehailing. Competitors include Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit and Tesla Inc., which plans to begin offering rides in Austin with no driver behind the wheel as early as Sunday..The Amazon-owned company’s purpose-built robotaxi is akin to a shuttle and has no steering wheel or pedals, with four inward-facing seats. Zoox would need an exemption from US auto safety rules that require vehicles to have driver controls, though the Trump administration has said it’s working on changes to provide those approvals faster..Zoox is “very grateful” to the administration’s work in preparing the US for robotaxis and talks with regulatory bodies are “going well”, Evans said..Zoox is testing or operating robotaxis on a limited basis in San Fransisco and Las Vegas, where it plans to launch its service. Waymo, which uses vehicles made by other automakers that it rigs with self-driving software and sensors, is seen as the market leader and charges fares for rides in multiple US markets..To start, Zoox has a dozen of its robotaxis driving on the Las Vegas Strip, Evans said. The commercial service will launch later in the year and pricing will be competitive with traditional ride-hailing services..(Updates with Bloomberg Television interview starting in the third paragraph.).Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek.Ken Griffin on Trump, Harvard and Why Novice Investors Won’t Beat the Pros.Is Mark Cuban the Loudmouth Billionaire that Democrats Need for 2028?.How a Tiny Middleman Could Access Two-Factor Login Codes From Tech Giants.Can ‘MAMUWT’ Be to Musk What ‘TACO’ Is to Trump?.American Mid: Hampton Inn’s Good-Enough Formula for World Domination.©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-zoox-opens-robotaxi-production-165722378.html,"```json

Buzz robotaxis next year, taking on Tesla and Waymo",Volkswagen-backed autonomous tech company MOIA is offering up a robotaxi of its own which mobility operators can buy next year.,"Volkswagen-backed autonomous tech company MOIA is offering up a robotaxi of its own which mobility operators can buy next year..Using VW’s (VWAGY) electric ID. Buzz as a donor vehicle, MOIA says it will create a “turnkey solution” for those looking for an autonomous production vehicle, the company said from an event in Hamburg, Germany..MOIA’s offering uses LiDAR, cameras, and radar combined with Mobileye’s self-driving system and the company’s own Autonomous Driving Mobility as a Service (AD MaaS) platform. MOIA said its AD MaaS software uses AI to manage fleets in real time and integrates into existing booking apps..In addition, the system meets key regulatory requirements for SAE Level 4 automated vehicles, MOIA said, using additional features like remote supervision and safe handling of emergency interventions on the streets..MOIA’s all-in-one offering — car, self-driving software, and robotaxi platform — comes as Tesla (TSLA) prepares to begin its robotaxi test in Austin in a few days..“Beginning in 2026, we will bring sustainable, autonomous mobility to large-scale deployment in Europe and the US, another milestone on our path to becoming a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen Group CEO, in a statement..VW claims the “MOIA Turnkey Solution” can be implemented by large commercial fleet operators, and the ID. Buzz AD will be deployed on Uber's platform starting next year in Los Angeles..VW believes the ID. Buzz is a strong choice for robotaxi use. It features an extended wheelbase and raised roof for added space, sliding electric doors for ease of entry, four separate seats, and storage space both up front and in the rear..“The ID. Buzz AD is purpose-built for autonomous mobility services. It’s a cabin designed entirely around passenger needs – and the realities of driverless ridepooling or ridehailing,” Christian Senger, CEO of Volkswagen Autonomous Mobility said in a statement to Yahoo Finance..VW and MOIA did not say how much the vehicle would cost when it goes on sale. It is estimated that similar vehicles, like Waymo’s (GOOG) bespoke Jaguar I-PACE, cost upwards of $100,000, though as one of the largest automakers in the world, VW may be able to save money since it owns the ID. Buzz platform and has advantages of scale..Waymo, the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 trips a week, announced it is expanding service in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and just revealed it is bringing service to New York City (but with a safety driver). And it's countering the cost issue by partnering with manufacturers like Toyota and China’s Zeekr.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vw-to-sell-id-buzz-robotaxis-next-year-taking-on-tesla-and-waymo-161953142.html,"```json
