I'm Josh Lipton and for the next half hour, we are breaking down the trends of today that will move stocks tomorrow. There's a lot to keep track of, so we're focusing on what you need to know to get ahead of the curve. AI is still alive and well on Wall Street, but the landscape keeps changing as various players enter the AI arena. For more on what you need to know about the biggest names in the game, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Tech editor, and that would be Dan Howley. Dan. .That's right, Josh. We're just going to break down some of the, the bigger names. So to start things off, obviously the 800 pound gorilla, that's OpenAI, and we're going to put Microsoft in there together with them since they have teamed up. Obviously, it's been a very lucrative relationship between the two. Uh, OpenAI has ChatGPT kind of kicked off the entire generative AI explosion. Uh, Microsoft has been using that technology in its co-pilot and and its Azure platform. But more recently, the two were at loggerheads. They can't come to an agreement over how OpenAI should restructure its own business. And so that is leading to some reports that Microsoft may be, you know, trying to work on its own generative AI offerings while OpenAI may be trying to work on its own productivity suites. But after OpenAI and Microsoft, there's obviously Google. Uh, we have their Gemini service. It's similar to what you would get out of ChatGPT. Uh, they offer document creation. Uh, you can upload files, you can create images, things along those lines, but it also has the power of Google behind it. You might have probably used Gemini if you've used basically any Google product at this point because it's across the entire company's ecosystem, whether that's through YouTube, mail, docs, even your regular Google search, when you see AI overviews, that's powered by Gemini. Then after that, we have obviously Meta. Uh, Mark Zuckerberg is trying to recadjigger the company once again after the metaverse fiasco that didn't really go anywhere except for give us some weird looking legless avatars. Uh, now he's going all in on AI, and they seem to be doing relatively well here. Uh, they obviously have Meta AI. It's available through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The problem though is their most recent model called Lama for Behemoth seems to be delayed, and there's no end in sight for when that delay will end. And so now, Meta is going out and scooping up talent from other AI companies, whether that's the CEO of Scale AI, Alexander Wang. Uh, we also had Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO, uh and Safe Super Intelligence, their CEO, Daniel Gross. They've all been packed up. Uh, Sam Altman at OpenAI said Meta is trying to offer some of his employees hundred million dollars to sign on. So I said that on a podcast with his brother, so we can't really know if that's for certain. Uh, after that, obviously, there's some others. There's XAI. That's from Elon Musk. He offers Grock through that. That is their chatbot. You can get it through X. Uh, you can use it on the website or through an app. Big thing about Grock is it's able to pull data not only from the web, but also from X, so it can get live data through there. Then we have others, we have Perplexity. That is basically a search engine built with generative AI in mind. Probably the best example of a competitor to what Google has to offer. Uh, it also has a lot of sourcing available, so it'll show you the sources of each, from each of those results that you search for. Obviously, you can also generate images if you want to do that, things along those lines. Uh, and then finally, we have Anthropic. That's gotten a lot of funding through Google and Amazon. It's available through a number of services, and they as well offer a kind of web browser experience where you can search, you can create different documents and things along those lines. But really, those are the major players that you have to be watching out for. There's a few others. Uh, obviously, we have Thinking Machines from OpenAI alumni. We also have a few others like Mistral out of France. Uh, but these seven here are really the biggest players at the moment. .All right. Thank you, Dan.

The chipmaker's stock was up over 1% in premarket trading on Thursday..Nvidia shares previously hit a record close of $149.43 on Jan. 6. The stock's gain also saw shares reach a fresh intraday high during Wednesday's trading session..The AI chipmaker’s stock has seen a significant upswing following its first quarter earnings in late May, which featured revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations and showed the company continuing to thrive despite a new export ban on sales of its chips to one of its largest markets: China..Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action..Shares have jumped more than 14% since Nvidia’s May 28 earnings report, far ahead of the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) roughly 3.4% gain in that time frame..Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah on Wednesday raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250, the highest of Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. The new price target suggests Nvidia's market cap could soar to $6 trillion from its current $3.6 trillion level..""While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,"" Baruah wrote in a note to clients, adding that Loop Capital analysts see the market for AI chips growing to $2 trillion in 2028..To be sure, questions remain over whether AI infrastructure demand will continue to rise, as Big Tech companies rake in far less revenue than they're spending to build the tech..Nvidia stock had struggled in the months following its record close in January as President Trump embarked on his trade war and artificial intelligence competition in China rattled the broader markets..Nvidia shares plunged in late January when a new cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek prompted demand concerns for its AI chips. Then, the stock plummeted again in April as Trump's steep tariff announcements rocked the stock market. Trump enacted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China, costing the chipmaker $2.5 billion in lost revenue in the first quarter and a projected $8 billion loss in the second quarter..At the same time, Nvidia's competition in the Chinese market was heating up from domestic tech giant Huawei. Huawei is reportedly readying a new advanced AI chip that would be competitive with Nvidia's prior-generation H100 chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-notches-fresh-record-high-in-remarkable-2025-turnaround-200401502.html,"```json

Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential..This infinite workday ""starts early, mostly in email, and quickly swells to a focus-sapping flood of messages, meetings, and interruptions,"" the report says..An average employee is online by six am, reviewing a fraction of the 117 emails they'll receive that day. By the time they're entering peak productivity hours, between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. and again between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., they're knee-deep in meetings and receiving workflow interruptions every two minutes..Things aren't winding down in the evening, either. Microsoft's data shows that there has been a 16% increase in meetings after 8 p.m. year-over-year. Additionally, the average employee receives 50+ teams messages outside of core work hours..Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100..All of this leads to a sense of exhaustion and an increased mental load. Just under half of all employees, 48%, and a full 52% of leaders say their ""work feels chaotic and fragmented,"" thanks to the frenetic pace and constant digital noise..Microsoft says that while the trend of the 24/7 workday is concerning, it doesn't have to be that way. ""AI can give us the leverage to redesign the rhythm of work, refocus our teams on new and differentiating work, and fix what has become a seemingly infinite workday. The question isn't whether work will change. It's whether we will,"" the report reads..Outsourcing mundane tasks is a good place to start. ""By deploying AI and agents to streamline low-value tasks—status meetings, routine reports, admin churn—leaders can reclaim time for what moves the business: deep work, fast decisions, and focused execution,"" the report says.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-9-5-feels-more-041602900.html,"```json

""We want to become the organiser of the industry in the artificial super intelligence era,"" Son told shareholders at the group's annual shareholder meeting.  Son likened his aim to the position of dominant technology platform providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google, which benefit from a ""winner takes all"" dynamic.","By Anton Bridge.TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son on Friday said he wants the Japanese technology investment group to become the biggest platform provider for ""artificial super intelligence"" within the next 10 years..""We want to become the organiser of the industry in the artificial super intelligence era,"" Son told shareholders at the group's annual shareholder meeting..Son likened his aim to the position of dominant technology platform providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google, which benefit from a ""winner takes all"" dynamic..At previous public appearances Son has described artificial super intelligence as AI technology that is able to exceed human capabilities by a factor of 10,000..SoftBank has returned to making the aggressive investments that made Son's name, such as an early bet on Alibaba, but that at times spectacularly backfired, like its massive investment in failed shared office provider WeWork..Its AI-related deals this year include acquiring U.S. semiconductor designer Ampere for $6.5 billion and the underwriting of up to $40 billion of new investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI..Son said SoftBank's total agreed investment in OpenAI now stood at $32 billion since first investing in Autumn 2024 and that he regretted not investing earlier. He also said he expected OpenAI to eventually list publicly..""I'm all in on OpenAI,"" Son said..SoftBank had owned around 5% of Nvidia until it sold the stake in 2019, before ChatGPT generated a surge in AI interest at the end of 2022. Nvidia now dominates AI chipmaking and has become one of the world's most valuable companies..Son's latest spending spree follows years of retrenchment after the high-growth tech startups into which SoftBank had invested billions of dollars through its Vision Fund investment vehicles crashed in value from 2022..Fortunes changed again when SoftBank raised some $5 billion listing chip designer Arm in September 2023. The rise in the British firm's share price since has boosted the group's assets, against which SoftBank can take out debt to fund new investment..Son said SoftBank was committed to prudent investment and that, throughout the peaks and troughs, SoftBank has maintained the financial resources and user base such that it can take risks at times..Earlier in June it raised $4.8 billion from the sale of some shares in T-Mobile..(Reporting by Anton Bridge; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Christopher Cushing)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-aiming-become-leading-artificial-021026565.html,"```json

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), as well as two micro-cap stocks BK Technologies Corp. (BKTI) and NeurAxis, Inc. (NRXS). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>> Ahead of Wall StreetThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company capitalizes on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion. Strong Office 365 Commercial demand has been propelling Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth. ARPU increases through E5 and M365 Copilot uptake across key segments. Intelligent Cloud revenues advance through Azure AI development and AI Copilot business growth. Strategic execution has been enhancing non-AI services through enterprise customer growth and operational scale improvements. Xbox content and services benefit from robust performance across third-party and first-party content offerings. The Zacks analyst expects that fiscal 2025 net sales will increase 13.7% compared to fiscal 2024. However, elevated operating expenses and Azure investments amid intensifying cloud competition remain concerns for the stakeholders.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +20.8%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. Continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with over 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles space. The Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 28.95% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell and Ada GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Bank of America’s shares have gained +22.3% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s gain of +40.9%. While the company’s high funding costs are still a woe, net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by relatively higher rates. The Zacks analyst expect NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% by 2027. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 5.8% in 2025.Nevertheless, the volatile nature of the trading business is a concern. Despite an impressive trading performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward, thus hurting fee income growth. We project non-interest income to rise only 4.5% in 2025. Also, steady investments in the franchise will likely keep operating expenses elevated, thus hurting profitability. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe,(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Shares of BK Technologies have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the year-to-date period (+58.2% vs. +7.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $199.92 million has achieved seven consecutive profitable quarters, driven by margin expansion and operational efficiency. First-quarter 2025 GAAP EPS rose to $0.55 and adjusted EPS to $0.68, supported by a product mix shift to higher-margin BKR 9000 radios and an asset-light model.Gross margin was 47%, and the 2025 guidance targets exceed $2.80 in adjusted EPS. The BKR 9000 is expanding across public safety verticals and the BK ONE SaaS platform adds high-margin, recurring revenue potential. A growing hardware-software ecosystem aims to boost the addressable market tenfold by 2027. Strong liquidity funds growth, but risks include federal revenue reliance, execution risk in SaaS adoption, margin pressure from tariffs and delays in mobile product launches. BKTI’s valuation assumes continued execution despite infrastructure and liquidity limitations.(You can read the full research report on BK Technologies here >>>)NeurAxis’ shares have gained +10.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry’s gain of +18%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $17.61 million targets a large, underserved $8 billion pediatric gut-brain disorder market with its FDA-cleared IB-Stim therapy for functional abdominal pain and dyspepsia, conditions affecting more than 600,000 U.S. children.Backed by 16 peer-reviewed studies and NASPGHAN guidelines, IB-Stim’s market potential doubled with its May 2025 label expansion. Covered lives grew from 4 million to 53 million, and a permanent CPT code will boost physician adoption and margins. The RED device clearance opens a $2 billion adult diagnostic market. Risks include high cash burn, slow CPT implementation and reliance on discounted sales. Yet, strong IP and a first-mover edge in a $22 billion market support long-term growth. The valuation suggests that investors are pricing in strong growth potential but remain cautious due to execution and reimbursement risks.(You can read the full research report on NeurAxis here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Coca-Cola Co.

16,2025-06-27 05:01:00,Windows killed the Blue Screen of Death,Why change the blue screen to black now? Did the viral images of Times Square rendered useless by the BSOD cause that much reputational harm?,"You’re laughing. Windows killed the Blue Screen of Death and you’re laughing..Yes, the iconic Windows error screen is getting a makeover nearly 40 years after its debut in the first version of Windows. Now the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) will become the Black Screen of Death (BSOD)..This change is related to other updates that Windows is making in the wake of the CrowdStrike outage last year, which affected 8.5 million Windows devices and took businesses, airports, TV stations, and government services offline..In the aftermath of the CrowdStrike outage, Microsoft announced the Windows Resiliency Initiative, which aims to more deeply embed security features into Windows to make a crisis like the CrowdStrike outage less likely..The initiative is also trying to make unexpected restarts less disruptive. Windows is adding a quick machine recovery feature, which helps PCs get back online if a restart is unsuccessful. Windows shared the new Black Screen of Death in a blog post, yet failed to even acknowledge the cosmic shift it has triggered. It simply calls this a “simplified UI,” because a blue background with white text was apparently too complex..Why even change the blue screen to black? Did the viral images of Times Square rendered useless by the BSOD cause that much reputational harm?.We’ve known this cobalt harbinger of trouble for a long time. When the BSOD first appeared in the 1985 version of Windows 1.0, it was legal to smoke cigarettes on planes; Germany was two separate countries; HTML code had not been created; Mark Zuckerberg was a baby who likely had not yet grasped the concept of object permanence..But as we go on, we remember the decades of fun and frustration we’ve wrought together, the ominous sapphire screen reflected in our eyes, now but a sepia-toned memory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/windows-killed-blue-screen-death-200106980.html,"```json

It offers AI training and inference cloud services built upon a growing stockpile of Nvidia GPUs. One of its investors is Nvidia, which helps it obtain the precious, short-in-supply chips..CoreWeave has both Microsoft and OpenAI as customers — the latter signed a deal to buy $12 billion worth of services and still has about $11 billion worth to buy. And Nvidia increased its stake after the IPO, the company disclosed..But CoreWeave borrows money against the GPUs to pay for them, and its IPO wasn’t big enough to get it out of that cycle. It’s got about $8.8 billion worth of debt as of March, it disclosed, with interest rates as high as 15%. Even though it brought in almost $1 billion in revenue in Q1 alone ($985 million), it recorded a net loss of about $315 million..That has not scared away investors, who remain eager for ways to make money on AI. CoreWeave’s stock has soared almost 300% since its March IPO, raising Intrator’s net worth to above $10 billion, Bloomberg calculates..But the wildest part of Intrator’s history, as well as that of his co-founders Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee, is that the whole thing started out as a make-money-quick, crypto mining enterprise when their previous company, a hedge fund, failed..The business partners went from a closet full of GPUs to thousands of them in a New Jersey warehouse, to an AI training experiment with an open source LLM group, EleutherAI, Venturo previously told TechCrunch..Today, the company is servicing the biggest LLM players on the planet, reportedly seeking to buy its competitor Core Scientific, and the founders are billionaires. And, as we previously reported, it’s not all paper money. All three founders pocketed over $150 million apiece by cashing out of shares ahead of the IPO..CoreWeave remains a symbol of the AI industry in 2025: Massive, fast-growing revenue and investor enthusiasm built on an insatiable need for more resources..CoreWeave declined additional comment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-3-months-coreweave-ceo-181218155.html,"{

The company’s quarterly revenue grew 13% from the prior year’s period to $70.1 billion. This was better than the $68.44 billion figure that analysts were expecting.

By implementing comprehensive AI governance, Allegis has achieved 50% reduction in high-risk AI projects, cut audit times from weeks to hours, and saved millions in insurance premiums - all while accelerating enterprise-wide AI adoption..Allegis purchased Holistic AI through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Holistic AI is a member of Microsoft's Founders' Hub, the Pegasus Program..With over 500 offices in 30 countries and more than 200,000+ contractors under management, Allegis Group relies on AI to power critical operations including job description creation, candidate matching, job searches, document drafting, analysis and modification, and contractor interactions. As adoption expanded across nine operating divisions, the organization faced mounting risk due to a lack of centralized visibility and governance..""AI is everywhere in our operations. But we didn't have visibility. We didn't know how many systems were using AI, what they were doing or what risks they carried. Initially, we had vetted about 145 AI systems, but when we dug deeper, we found 500 to 600 additional AI-related domains and tools being used,"" said Henry Fieglein, Enterprise Architecture Lead at Allegis Group. ""Holistic AI gave us a scalable, unified solution for governance. It wasn't just about identifying risk, it was about helping us quantify, classify, understand, and take action so we could mitigate those risks."".Facing increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly from laws like NYC's AI Bias Audit Law and the forthcoming EU AI Act, Allegis needed a scalable solution to discover, classify, and govern its growing AI portfolio without slowing innovation. Holistic AI enabled Allegis to implement a centralized risk registry that provided executives with clear visibility into AI systems, risk categories, and mitigation strategies across the enterprise..""As a leader in staffing and recruiting, Allegis is pioneering the use of AI to transform its business while prioritizing customer trust in its operations,"" said Emre Kazim, co-founder and co-CEO of Holistic AI. ""With Holistic AI, Allegis can increase visibility, speed, and control of AI projects, eliminate communication bottlenecks across their nine operating companies, and significantly reduce AI risk at enterprise scale. Holistic AI delivers proactive governance and continuous monitoring across the entire AI lifecycle - from development through deployment and ongoing oversight - everything Allegis needs to maintain their competitive advantage.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allegis-group-achieves-enterprise-wide-160000630.html,"```json

Is It Too Late to Buy NVDA Stock for July?,"NVDA stock is still the AI chip leader to own, but the shares look short-term overbought at current prices.","Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) has solidified its position as the world's most valuable company, achieving a market capitalization of $3.77 trillion - and surpassing its “Magnificent 7” counterparts Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) in the process. In fact, NVDA stock reached a new record high of $156.71 earlier today, representing a remarkable recovery of over 80% from its April 2025 year-to-date lows..In the month of June alone, NVDA has gained a staggering 15.16% - easily outstripping its average return of 1.31% for the month since 2010. This is currently Nvidia’s best monthly performance for the month of June since 2021 - though it should be noted that this kind of double-digit return is roughly on par for the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader over the last half-decade or so..Tesla’s Robotaxis Reportedly Sped and Veered Into the Wrong Lanes.

So, should investors buy into Nvidia’s strength - or wait for a pullback in the outperforming stock?.The chip company's Q1 2025 performance was exceptional, with revenue surging 69% year-over-year to $44.1 billion, including $35.6 billion from data centers. Nvidia's technological leadership remains unchallenged, with nearly 100 Nvidia-powered AI factories now in progress, double the number from the previous year..The company maintains an aggressive innovation pipeline, planning annual chip architecture releases including Blackwell Ultra (2025), Vera Rubin (2026), and Vera Rubin Ultra (2027).

26,2025-06-26 23:31:00,Will Microsoft's AI Services Help Maintain Its Cloud Growth Momentum?,MSFT rides on a surge in AI-driven Azure adoption as custom agents and new MU model push cloud growth even higher.,"Microsoft MSFT has been expanding its Azure platform and AI services to support the growing demand for intelligent tools and automation. The company continues to integrate AI into its offerings. These offerings are built on Azure infrastructure and help organizations create and deploy their own AI agents. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, over 10,000 organizations had used Agent Service, and more than 1 million custom agents were created across Microsoft platforms, up 130% quarter over quarter. Microsoft also processed more than 100 trillion tokens in the quarter, up 5 times year over year..Recently, Microsoft introduced the MU language model, which now powers the new AI agent in Windows 11 Settings. The agent allows users to interact with system settings using natural language. The technology, which is powered by Azure AI, shows how Microsoft is using its AI services to power real-world features across its ecosystem..The launch of the MU model and its integration into Windows is expected to increase usage of Azure’s AI tools and services. As more users and organizations adopt these agent-based features, Azure cloud consumption is likely to rise. This supports Microsoft’s ongoing focus on bringing AI into mainstream productivity and enterprise workflows..In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment generated $26.8 billion in revenues, up 21% year over year. It accounted for 37.9% of MSFT’s total revenues. Azure and other cloud services grew 33%, with AI services contributing 16 percentage points to that growth. Our model estimate for the Intelligent Cloud segment’s revenues in fiscal 2025 is pegged at $105.3 billion, indicating 20.4% growth year over year..Microsoft is facing tough competition from Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, ramping up agentic AI efforts.Amazon’s AWS is making it easier to build agentic AI with tools like Agents for Bedrock, AWS App Studio and Amazon Q that help developers create AI agents that work across apps and data. With built-in support for orchestration and reasoning, Amazon’s AWS is becoming a strong platform for next-gen AI tools..Alphabet’s Google Cloud is pushing into agentic AI with tools like Agent Builder. With built-in orchestration and support for Gemini models, Alphabet is making agent development faster and more accessible for real-world use..MSFT shares have gained 17.7% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 13.5% and 4.5%, respectively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-ai-services-help-maintain-153100201.html,"```json

27,2025-06-27 00:18:00,There Are Currently Better Options Than Microsoft,The reason other Mag-7 stocks are more attractive at the moment.,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies, belonging to the mag-7 and being the biggest company in the world according to market capitalization. While MSFT is definitely a great company, this article will show why it currently is not a buy for me, mainly because there are better deals in other mag-7 companies at lower valuations and better fundamentals..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96%..The same can also be said for growth. While MSFT is not as far ahead of other companies as it was in terms of profitability, a revenue growth rate of 14.13% and an EBITDA growth rate of 19.16% are still great. Furthermore, forward growth rates are even stronger than current ones, suggesting a positive outlook. Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE growth expected to be negative..As with all Mag-7 companies, valuation is the biggest problem for Microsoft. Everyone already knows that we are talking about a great company, so the most important thing to get right is to find a good entrance price. Currently, the EV/EBITDA ratio of the stock is relatively high at 22.8, a 31% premium to the industry median. Moreover, the P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium, respectively. The P/E ratio at 35.11 is also very high at the moment. Figure 1 shows the historical P/E ratio of MSFT as can be seen, the company currently trades at 2020 and 2023 levels, leaving it at a higher bound of its average valuation..When comparing Microsoft's user base to that of other Mag-7 companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), one can instantly see that the company's valuation is elevated. At around 1.5 billion users and a market cap of 3.35T, the company has a valuation of $2.233 per user. At the same time, GOOG and META only have valuations of $820 and $494 per user, respectively, making them much cheaper in comparison. Additionally, ROE is a weak point too, with only Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) being worse at 8.79% and 25.24%, respectively..From a growth perspective, Microsoft is solid but does not particularly stand out at slightly better revenue growth but significantly less EBITDA growth than Alphabet. Furthermore, the negative ROE growth is the second worst in the peer group, with only Tesla's ROE falling by almost 70%. In total, Microsoft seems fundamentally somewhere around the average, with profitability being a strength while growth is a comparative weakness.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currently-better-options-microsoft-093720326.html,"{

These partnerships with two of the largest connected TV (CTV) publishers are eroding what was previously viewed as The Trade Desk’s advantage in CTV inventory availability..A recent survey conducted by Wells Fargo revealed that among The Trade Desk customers, 50% indicated Amazon DSP was already taking ""modest share"" of non-Amazon CTV budgets, while 30% reported ""significant share"" shifts to Amazon’s platform..Despite the competitive concerns, Wells Fargo believes The Trade Desk can still meet 2025 consensus estimates due to healthy programmatic industry spending and potential benefits from advertisers moving away from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Xandr DSP, which is scheduled to shut down in March 2026.

It has been a remarkable turnaround for the chip designing giant as the stock briefly plunged below $100 in April amid the tariff chaos, which was made worse by export restrictions on the H20 chips that it had designed for China..Nvidia is now back to being the world’s most valuable company, a position it has held off and on.

In this article, we’ll discuss what lies ahead for the company after hitting record highs and whether it can rise above $200 next..The overall Street sentiment is quite bullish on NVDA, and of the 44 analysts covering the stock, 37 rate it as a “Strong Buy” while three rate it as a “Moderate Buy.” Three analysts rate the stock as a “Hold,” while one rates it as a “Strong Sell.” Nvidia’s mean target price is $174.83, while the most recent Street-high target price (via Loop Capital) is $250..Meanwhile, after Nvidia stock has hit record highs, investors might fancy the chances of it hitting the $200 price level, even as $250 might seem a bit far-fetched for now. Notably, apart from Loop, Tigress Financial, Barclays, Truist, Rosenblatt Securities, and Cantor Fitzgerald have put a target price of $200 or higher on Nvidia..Nvidia would need to rise over 29% for the stock to hit $200, sending its market cap to almost $5 trillion. Another 25% rally will help Nvidia’s stock reach its Street-high target price of $250, at which point its market cap should be north of $6 trillion.

(NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the top 10 picks from Harvard University’s stock portfolio. The Harvard Management Co.’s portfolio composition shows that the managers substantially increased their position in Microsoft in Q1. Around 366,700 shares were added in Q1 2025, which increased the position by approximately 8x, giving it a 14% weight..According to a June 19 report from the Financial Times, Microsoft and OpenAI are in the middle of complex negotiations to rework the terms of their long-standing partnership. A key point in the discussions is OpenAI’s proposal to convert from a non-profit model into a fully for-profit entity—a move that would require Microsoft’s consent and could shift the balance of control and economics in the relationship..The discussions have become increasingly difficult, with Microsoft reportedly open to walking away if no agreement is reached. At issue is the size of Microsoft’s stake in a restructured OpenAI, given its more than $13 billion investment to date. If no new terms are agreed upon, Microsoft could continue operating under its current agreement, which guarantees access to OpenAI’s models and a 20% share of related revenues through 2030..Other terms are also under review. Microsoft currently holds exclusive rights to distribute OpenAI’s products through Azure and also has rights to early access to the company’s infrastructure and models. With growing competition in the AI space, Microsoft is seeking to maintain these advantages, while OpenAI is under pressure to finalize its restructuring plan to meet investor conditions from its recent funding rounds..Despite issuing a joint statement underscoring a positive working relationship, sources close to the matter suggest Microsoft is not in a hurry to revise a deal that already works in its favor. Meanwhile, OpenAI is working against a year-end deadline to secure approvals and retain investor commitments, including from SoftBank..Microsoft recently made xAI’s Grok available to its Azure customers. This kind of moves not only broaden its AI portfolio, but also suggest that the company is positioning itself to rely less heavily on OpenAI if necessary. The outcome of these talks may have wider implications for how major tech players approach access to foundational AI models going forward..Microsoft Corp.

31,2025-06-26 23:09:00,MSFT vs. PEGA: Which Agentic AI Vendor is a Better Buy in 2H25?,PEGA's specialized agentic AI focus offers superior upside versus MSFT's broader platform. Buy PEGA for concentrated AI exposure; hold/wait on MSFT for better entry.,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has entered a new phase with the emergence of agentic AI — systems capable of autonomous decision-making and task execution rather than merely assisting human users. Two prominent players in this space, Microsoft MSFT and Pegasystems PEGA, are taking distinctly different approaches to capitalize on this transformative technology. Microsoft leverages its massive cloud infrastructure and enterprise software ecosystem to integrate agentic capabilities across its portfolio, while Pegasystems focuses on specialized workflow automation and legacy system modernization powered by AI agents.Both companies recently announced significant expansions of their agentic AI offerings, with Microsoft evolving Copilot into autonomous digital workers and Pega enhancing its Blueprint platform to automatically transform legacy systems into modern applications. The timing of these announcements, coupled with strong financial performance from both companies, makes for a compelling comparison as investors seek exposure to the next wave of AI innovation.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Microsoft's approach to agentic AI represents a comprehensive platform strategy that spans its entire technology stack. The company's third-quarter fiscal 2025 results demonstrated continued momentum, with total revenues reaching $70.1 billion, up 13% year over year. Microsoft Cloud revenues of $42.4 billion grew 22% in constant currency, with Azure showing particularly strong performance at 33% growth, including 16 percentage points from AI services alone.The company's agentic AI strategy centers on transforming Copilot from a simple assistant into autonomous digital workers capable of reasoning, planning, and acting independently. Microsoft processed more than 100 trillion tokens during the quarter, representing a five-fold increase year over year, indicating massive adoption of its AI services. The company has introduced specialized agents like Sales Agent and Customer Service Agent while enabling customers to build custom agents through Copilot Studio, with more than 230,000 organizations already using the platform.Microsoft's scale advantages are evident in its infrastructure investments, with capital expenditures of $21.4 billion in the quarter supporting long-term monetization. The company's diverse revenue streams provide stability, though this same diversification may limit the upside potential from any single technology trend. Azure's strong performance demonstrates Microsoft's ability to capture enterprise AI workloads, but the company's massive size means incremental growth from agentic AI represents a smaller percentage impact on overall results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $13.36 per share, indicating a 13.22% year-over-year increase.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/msft-vs-pega-agentic-ai-140900578.html,"```json

In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, NVDA reported that nearly 100 NVIDIA-powered AI factories are currently in progress, twice the number from a year ago. Each factory is also using more graphics processing units (GPUs) than before, showing strong demand for large-scale AI compute infrastructure..These AI factories use more than just NVIDIA chips. They also rely on NVIDIA’s networking tools (like NVLink and Spectrum-X), software platforms (such as CUDA and NeMo) and full-stack systems. This makes it harder for customers to switch to other providers. Hence, once customers choose NVIDIA, they often stay..Governments and large enterprises across the world, including Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, are working with NVIDIA to build sovereign AI infrastructure. Hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google are also expanding their use of NVIDIA’s full-stack systems..Competitors may offer lower-cost hardware, but replicating NVIDIA’s end-to-end solution remains a challenge. With software optimization, ongoing performance improvements and strong developer support, NVIDIA continues to strengthen its grip on the AI infrastructure market..In simple terms, NVIDIA is not just selling chips but building the foundation for the AI world with its networking and software tools. If this trend continues, it may become even harder for competitors to catch up..Two competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC, are also trying to grow in the AI infrastructure space, but they are far behind NVIDIA when it comes to AI factory buildouts..Advanced Micro Devices is gaining attention with its Instinct MI300X chips, which are designed for large AI workloads. Some major cloud companies like Microsoft and Meta are testing AMD’s GPUs. However, Advanced Micro Devices does not yet offer a full-stack solution like NVIDIA. It lacks networking hardware and software tools at the same level as CUDA or NeMo..Intel is promoting its Gaudi 3 AI chips as a low-cost option for training and inference. However, Intel’s AI ecosystem is still developing, and its overall AI market share remains small. It also does not offer a complete package that ties chips, software and networking together..Both companies are making progress, but NVIDIA’s complete system gives it a strong lead..Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 15.1% year to date against the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s gain of 4.4%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ai-factory-buildouts-double-125000946.html,"```json

NVDA — the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) — regained the crown of the world’s most valuable company in terms of market capital..On June 25, the stock price of NVDA closed at an all-time high of $154.31, with a market capital of $3.763 trillion, surpassing one of its major client Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT market capital of around $3.66 trillion..NVIDIA recorded its previous all-time high of $149.41 at January end. Thereafter, the stock fell significantly due to the unveiling of the low-cost Chinese DeepSeek AI platform, the Trump administration’s decision to stop the export of NVDA’s high-end H20 AI processor to China and global turmoil related to trade after President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs..The stock price recorded its recent low in early April. From there, it surged nearly 80% with a year-over-year gain of more than 15%. The recent rally of NVDA is highly commendable despite the fact that the company warned last month that export restrictions would cost it $8 billion in sales and a $4.5 billion inventory write off. NVIDIA is no longer counting any sales from China..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.NVIDIA reaffirmed its commitment to continued innovation, evolution and execution. After the successful execution of Hopper GPUs, NVDA’s Blackwell GPUs have already seen a record high units sold to cloud providers..NVIDIA is expected to unveil Blackwell Ultra — in the second half of 2025 and begin shipping of Vera Rubin — in 2026. In addition, the company decided that it will announce its roadmap for Rubin Next — to be introduced in 2027 and Feynman AI chips in 2028..NVIDIA is supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Four of the “magnificent 7” stocks have decided to invest a massive $325 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 46% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem..Apart from Microsoft, other giant customers are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc.

This marks a significant improvement from last year’s data, when over 82% of enterprise devices were not running Windows 11. With just under four months remaining until Microsoft officially ends support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, the data highlights both encouraging progress and critical gaps in enterprise readiness across industries, geographies, and organization sizes..“While the 50% completion mark is a major milestone, it's not time to relax,” said Marcel Calef, Americas Field CTO, ControlUp. “With Windows 10 end of support just months away, organizations need to act now to avoid being caught off guard. Our data shows that the rate of migration is uneven, and many enterprises still face significant hardware and planning challenges.”.Industry Disparities Highlight Readiness Gaps.ControlUp’s analysis of over one million enterprise endpoints shows that Education and Technology sectors are leading the migration, with 77% and 73% of their devices already running Windows 11, respectively. In contrast, Healthcare (41%) and Finance (45%) are falling behind. A deeper look reveals that 19% of Healthcare endpoints need to be replaced entirely before they can support Windows 11, compared to just 3% in Finance..Americas Trail Behind Europe and Other Regions.By region, the Americas are furthest behind, with only 43% of enterprise endpoints upgraded to Windows 11, even though 87% of those devices are Windows 11 ready. Europe leads all regions at 70% completion, followed by other global regions at 66%. These regional differences could impact multinational organizations’ ability to maintain consistency and security across their environments..Larger Enterprises Facing the Greatest Hurdles.ControlUp’s data also reveals that very large organizations (with over 10K Windows devices) are the least prepared for the end of Windows 10 support, with just 42% of migrations completed. These organizations often have complex IT environments and a higher volume of legacy hardware, making early assessments and planning essential..“ControlUp’s Windows 11 readiness assessment tool helps IT teams instantly evaluate endpoint compatibility, identify upgrade opportunities, and flag devices needing replacement, all from a single dashboard,” Calef added.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/half-enterprise-windows-endpoints-not-120200618.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Cybersecurity Dive newsletter. .Microsoft plans to roll out key platform upgrades in July in an effort to build greater operational resilience into the Windows platform, following the 2024 global IT outage linked to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike..The changes — including quick machine recovery and other features letting Microsoft 365 users continue accessing the cloud in a protected environment — are part of a Windows overhaul that Microsoft announced in November to build a more secure environment that would prevent software updates from causing widespread operational disruptions for enterprise customers. In September, the company met with major security firms to discuss how such an overhaul would work..“We recognize our shared responsibility to enhance resiliency by openly sharing information about how our products function, handle updates and manage disruptions,” David Weston, corporate vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, said in a blog post released Thursday..Microsoft’s partners welcomed the changes and said they would create a more secure environment for customers..Alex Ionescu, chief technology innovation officer at CrowdStrike, said after the company spoke at the September Windows Endpoint Security Ecosystem Summit in 2024, it has seen significant customer interest in the effort to drive greater platform resiliency. .“Through this collaboration, we’ve driven substantial improvements to the planned capabilities for WESP, paving the way for a more integrated high-performing security solution,” Ionescu told Cybersecurity Dive in an emailed statement..“With the introduction of MVI 3.0, we’ve successfully met all the new standards and recognize how these rigorous requirements strengthen the overall ecosystem..“The Microsoft Windows endpoint security program encourages a collaborative, transparent environment that will strengthen cyber resilience for all customers,” Jim Treinen, senior vice president of engineering at Trellix, told Cybersecurity Dive via email..The July 2024 outage caused approximately 8.5 million Windows systems to malfunction, resulting in major disruptions across a wide variety of critical infrastructure providers. Emergency services providers, major hospitals, airlines and banks all reported significant problems. .After an internal investigation, CrowdStrike said the problem resulted from a botched software update on its Falcon platform.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-windows-more-resilient-following-120000457.html,"```json

The Financial Times added to the discourse, suggesting that Microsoft might consider halting discussions if they cannot resolve critical issues, including the size of Microsoft's future equity stake..Despite these challenges, both Microsoft and OpenAI expressed a positive outlook in a joint statement. ""Talks are ongoing and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,"" they affirmed..Altman echoed this sentiment in his conversation with the New York Times, acknowledging the natural tensions in a deep partnership but emphasising the overall beneficial relationship for both entities..Adding to the significance of these talks, Altman revealed his productive dialogue with US President Donald Trump on the subject of AI..He commended Trump for his grasp of the technology's geopolitical and economic implications..In January, Trump announced Stargate, a colossal private sector investment initiative aimed at bolstering AI infrastructure, with contributions from SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, potentially reaching up to $500bn..In April 2025, OpenAI raised $40bn in a new funding round, propelling its valuation to a post-money total of $300bn.

Here's what investors need to know today..U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher with the S&P 500 remaining near its record closing high as geopolitical tensions cool in the wake of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. S&P 500 futures are 0.4% higher after the benchmark index closed fractionally lower yesterday, while Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $107,500. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note also is down slightly. Both oil and gold futures are ticking higher..President Donald Trump is considering naming a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell ""by September or October,"" even though the embattled central banker still has 11 months remaining in his term, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Trump has been critical of Powell for not leading the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates as inflation has ticked lower. The report said Trump is considering former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is being pitched to him ""by allies of both men as a potential candidate."".Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) both reached all-time highs on Wednesday as the two tech titans compete for the title of world's most valuable company. Nvidia's stock rose more than 4% yesterday to push its market capitalization to nearly $3.77 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's $3.66 trillion. Microsoft has set a new record closing high 12 times in June, while Nvidia moved past its prior record high set in January. Microsoft shares are ticking higher in premarket trading, while Nvidia's are up 1.3%..Micron Technology (MU) shares are rising 2.3% in premarket trading after the memory chip maker reported record revenue in as surging AI demand spurred strong data center sales. Micron reported fiscal third-quarter revenue of $9.3 billion, up 37% year-over-year, well above the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91 also topped estimates. The gains came as the Nvidia partner's data center sales more than doubled. Micron's outlook for the current quarter also exceeded analyst estimates.

However, the company is the leading supplier of data center chips for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and we know Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, and Oracle are some of the biggest buyers of that hardware based on their public filings..Those data center chips are called graphics processing units (GPUs), and you won't believe the eye-popping amount of money their customers are spending on these chips. Read on..There are two primary AI workloads: Training, which involves feeding truckloads of data into AI models to make them ""smarter,"" and inference, which is the process by which AI models use that data to formulate responses or make predictions. These two workloads are processed in enormous data centers filled with thousands of GPUs, which cost billions of dollars to build..Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have the financial resources to build AI infrastructure to develop their own AI models. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle also build AI data centers and rent out the computing power to smaller developers for profit, which has become a very lucrative business practice because demand for capacity continues to far exceed supply..Here's how much money the top AI companies are spending on AI data centers overall at the moment, based on their public filings:.Amazon is allocating up to $105 billion to capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 alone, most of which will go toward AI data centers and GPUs..Microsoft's 2025 fiscal year will end on June 30, and the company is on track to have spent over $80 billion on AI infrastructure..Alphabet is forecasting AI capex spending of $75 billion in calendar year 2025..Meta Platforms originally planned to spend up to $65 billion to fuel its AI ambitions in 2025, but it recently raised the high end of its forecast to $72 billion..Oracle's 2025 fiscal year recently ended on May 31, and it spent $21.2 billion on AI infrastructure.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position.","Apple's stock trades at a premium valuation despite putting up slow growth..Amazon's operating income growth is a vital metric..Alphabet is drastically undervalued for its performance..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position. Although it's still the third-largest company in the world, Microsoft and Nvidia have overtaken Apple, likely for good, as the growth these two are putting up far surpasses Apple's..However, I don't think we've seen the last of companies surpassing Apple in terms of market cap over the next few years. I think we'll see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surpass Apple by 2030. Several key factors play into this prediction, but Amazon's and Alphabet's performances aren't the only reason they'll surpass Apple..Apple's brand may be the most valuable on Earth, but that's about all it has going for it. Apple has posted anemic growth over the past few years, and it could be debated that Apple's growth has been essentially nonexistent when inflation is factored into the calculation..Despite that, Apple's stock trades like a hot growth stock, trading at 28 times forward earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 22.8 times forward earnings, with an average growth rate of about 10% per year. Apple's growth rate is far below that pace, so at most, Apple's stock should receive a market-average multiple, at least from my perspective..If Apple's valuation were to decline to a market-average multiple, it would tumble nearly 20%. That would put Apple's market cap at around $2.44 trillion, which is where we'll start our comparison..Currently, Amazon's market cap is $2.23 trillion and Alphabet's is $2.03 trillion. That's not far from the $2.44 trillion that I think Apple should be trading at, but even if Apple's stock stays at its elevated level, I think these two can catch Apple by 2030..Let's start with Amazon, whose growth rate looks rather slow at first glance, similar to Apple's..However, that's the wrong way to look at Amazon's stock. Amazon can be split into two businesses: commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing. While the consumer-facing commerce division is widely known and what most people value the stock for, the real cash cow is AWS. In the first quarter, AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating profits despite making up just 19% of revenue. Furthermore, AWS's operating income rose 23% year over year in Q1.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-worth-more-093000400.html,"```json

The EU estimates that US duties now cover €380 billion ($446 billion), or about 70%, of its exports to the US..Over recent months, the US President has specifically called out the EU’s tech regulations as the kind of non-tariff trade barrier that his so-called reciprocal tariffs are intended to target with the White House signaling out previous EU penalties as a form of tariff..Despite the threats, the EU has pressed ahead with enforcement of its digital antitrust rules, with recent fines against Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. of €500 million and €200 million respectively..Ribera, a Spanish socialist, added Thursday that negotiations with Apple had been going “very well” since that April EU ultimatum on how the company should re-engineer its hugely profitable App Store in order to comply with the DMA.

Examples include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) using AI for up to 30% of its coding work, and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) handling 80% of its customer support through AI tools..Despite broader macro risks, including potential semiconductor tariffs and tensions in the Middle East, UBS said structural drivers of AI remain intact and should underpin further gains for tech stocks. The Nasdaq 100 hit a record high on Tuesday, helped by easing geopolitical concerns..UBS expects global AI capital spending to rise 33% in 2026 to $480 billion after surging 60% this year.

Microsoft has already scaled its AI segment to $13 billion in annual recurring revenueits fastest ramp everand Turrin thinks this trajectory could take total AI revenue to $100 billion by fiscal 2029. The bank maintains an overweight rating, citing Microsoft's edge across enterprise IT spend and its ability to keep expanding margins even in a tighter market..Warning!

Turrin expects Copilot to hit critical mass by next year, potentially generating $12 billion in recurring revenue on its own. His model assumes that just 10% of Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud's 430 million addressable users adopt Copilotat a 20% average discountto deliver a $10 billion run rate. It's not a moonshot either. With generative AI embedded deeper into daily workflows, this adoption curve could steepen faster than most are modeling..Microsoft is already up 16% in 2025, and most analysts aren't backing down. LSEG data shows 55 out of 62 analysts rate it a buy or strong buy. While some may balk at the valuation, Wells Fargo thinks the AI flywheel is only getting started.

Over the past quarter, C3.ai's share price rose 7%, a movement that aligns closely with the general market trend, which increased by 12% over the past year. This upward trajectory benefits from recent announcements such as the $13 million task order from the USAF and the expansion of their joint venture with Baker Hughes, both of which likely supported the company's performance amidst these broader market conditions..We've discovered 2 weaknesses for C3.ai (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here..Trump's oil boom is here — pipelines are primed to profit. Discover the 22 US stocks riding the wave..With C3.ai's recent appointment of Rob Schilling as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, there is potential for this leadership change to accelerate the company’s commercial success by harnessing Schilling's extensive experience in enterprise software sales. Consequently, expanded partnerships with tech giants like Microsoft and AWS might bolster revenue, aiming at more consistent subscription revenue streams. However, despite recent gains, C3.ai's performance over the last three years shows a total shareholder return of 35.79%. This compares to a one-year timeframe where the company underperformed against the broader US market's 12.2% increase and also lagged behind the US Software industry, which returned 19.7%..In terms of financial forecasts, the positive momentum does not offset ongoing challenges. Analysts predict continued revenue growth, driven by strategic alliances, but the company remains unprofitable, with earnings expected to stay negative in the short term. Additionally, the anticipated effect of the $13 million task order from the USAF and the Baker Hughes joint venture is factored into forecasts that might reduce the gap between current performance and the expected target. The current share price of US$22.51 remains a discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$29.47, indicating a potential 23.6% upside, but there's notable skepticism among analysts about reaching these targets.

It serves as a key indicator of enterprise readiness, assessing whether AI systems can handle the kinds of high-effort, skilled tasks traditionally done by humans. For business leaders, this milestone means h2oGPTe is capable of handling the kind of nuanced decisions, regulations, and workflows that drive value in banking, telecom, healthcare, and government. H2O.ai first achieved the top GAIA ranking in December 2024 and continues to lead in production-grade, sovereign AI..The improved performance of H2O.ai's agent technology comes from key enhancements, including advanced browser navigation for precise information extraction, unified search across multiple sources like Google and Wikipedia, and the integration of Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Additionally, the platform now features GitHub integration for navigating codebases and real-time source attribution, ensuring transparency during research..""GAIA is fast becoming the barometer of enterprise intelligence, and at 79.7%, our agents aren’t just accurate, they’re adaptable,"" said H2O.ai CEO and Founder Sri Ambati. ""Gemini sharpened our vision and multimodal skills, Claude boosted our reasoning and code understanding, and now we're building toward an auto-agentic future, a framework where planning agents coordinate a series of task-specific power tools. DeepResearch already gave hedge funds an edge in volatile markets, and in today’s shifting geopolitical landscape, scenario planning is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. Delivering all of this, on-prem, inside sovereign AI environments for governments and public institutions, that’s a game changer."".H2O.ai’s agents are deployed in some of the world’s most highly regulated environments to support mission-critical, task-specific operations. Global banks use them to streamline regulatory reporting and detect fraud, telecom providers to optimize call centers, and public agencies to manage complex document workflows. H2O.ai offers a growing portfolio of vertical agents — prebuilt for industries like banking, telecom, and government — and a flexible agent builder framework for creating custom agents on private data and internal systems. Built on a multi-agent architecture, planning agents can coordinate specialized sub-agents across departments, delivering structure, speed, and scale. With human-in-the-loop review, continuous learning, and auditability built in, H2O agents meet strict compliance needs while accelerating decision-making and ROI.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/h2o-ai-breaks-world-record-175200283.html,"```json

Spending on AI computing gear has sent investors hunting for beneficiaries beyond marquee stocks like Nvidia Corp..Micron’s growth is being fueled by high-bandwidth memory — bundles of dynamic random access memory chips closely connected to processors from Nvidia — which is vital to AI computing. That’s helped drive up prices as supply remains constrained due to the complexity of producing and deploying such components..“Micron isn’t the star of AI, the way Nvidia is, but high-bandwidth memory chips are the gold standard for powering AI, and the demand for them is insatiable,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. Micron shares were about 0.5% lower at 1:30 p.m. in New York..The Boise, Idaho-based company is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 on revenue of about $8.9 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be an increase of 158% and 30% from the same period a year ago, respectively..“Pricing and availability of Micron’s high-bandwidth memory will be a central focus,” said Jake Behan, head of capital markets at Direxion. “Investors will be looking for clarity on production, supply constraints, and how well-positioned Micron is to meet hyperscaler and AI customer demand.”.Profitability will also be top of mind for investors after gross margins fell short of Wall Street expectations in the second quarter. Analysts at NewStreet Research are anticipating a recovery in DRAM and NAND gross margins, which would help Micron beat expectations..Adjusted gross margins are projected to be 36.8% in the third quarter, down from 37.9% in the previous quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates..Of course, anything short of a stellar report could trigger a selloff considering the magnitude of the stock’s gains.

The seemingly illogical tumble in energy prices highlighted a new global reality: the world is awash in oil.  Gasoline prices barely moved this week, but experts say motorists will likely see prices at the pump begin to fall, perhaps as early as this weekend.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar on Monday, threatening to stoke a wider conflict in the Middle East, a region that supplies the world with about a third of the oil used globally every year. That same day, benchmark U.S. crude tumbled more than 7%, one of the biggest single day sell-offs this year. The following day, the same thing happened, driving crude prices down by double digits this week..The seemingly illogical tumble in energy prices highlighted a new global reality: the world is awash in oil..Gasoline prices barely moved this week, but experts say motorists will likely see prices at the pump begin to fall, perhaps as early as this weekend..With the situation in the Middle East still volatile, Iran could try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world’s oil passes daily. While few expect Iran to do that because it would cripple the ability to move its own oil, the fact remains that there have been drastic changes in the 50 years since an Arab oil embargo hobbled the U.S. economy and sent energy prices skyrocketing..Following is a quick rundown of the new forces on supply and demand that have reshaped the global energy landscape, and what you can expect to see as far as prices at the pump this weekend..PRICES AT THE PUMP.Technical innovation in the last two decades has upended global energy markets and made the U.S. the world's top oil producer, surpassing even Saudi Arabia in 2018. It's contributed to an extended surplus of oil, and that has consistenly driven prices lower..Gas prices have been in broad decline for roughly three years. That has remained true even during traditional periods of high demand, like the summer travel season just now kicking into high gear..Part of the reason, according to Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, is that the U.S. announced aggressive tariffs against its trading partners at around the time of year that U.S. gas prices usually begin to rise. That suppressed demand, for both households and businesses, due to anticipation of economic fallout from a broader trade war..And prices are likely to begin falling again, and fast. Gas stations bought their fuel supplies before crude prices slumped this week, so motorists have not seen gas prices decline due to a typical lag between oil and gasoline prices..“I think that the national average will probably cease to increase in the next 24 to 48 hours,” Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy said Tuesday. “Then it should stabilize for maybe a day or two and then we should start to see prices — at least the national average — to start falling this weekend.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/middle-east-conflict-highlights-vastly-174015319.html,"```json

The latest round coincides with the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year on June 30. According to Bloomberg, this timing aligns with Microsoft’s historical pattern of announcing organizational changes around its fiscal year-end..Bloomberg also says that Microsoft has not specified the scale of layoffs, but the numbers are likely to be in the thousands.

The development led Cramer to speculate that perhaps there was friction between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI. 2025 has also seen a turnaround in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s shares. The stock is up 14% year-to-date primarily on the back of improving profitability of its Azure cloud computing business which had disappointed investors earlier. Cramer’s recent remarks about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) mentioned the friction between the firm and OpenAI:.“We didn’t even talk about Microsoft and the war that must be going with ChatGPT..Earlier, the CNBC host discussed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) important earnings report and the aftermath:.“Well Microsoft had guided, so suddenly you get on this call and they just crush it. They guide higher and there’s glee on the call. It’s glee. Amy Hood is happy. Satya Nadella is happy. They correct people if anyone is less happy. It was just, David, a happy call. Happy call.”.A development team working together to create the next version of Windows..“Oh my god, remember how Amy Hood at one point said that was non-AI, that was looking good she corrected a wayward analyst who just didn’t get the memo.”.While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

That compares with the original projection of 2028. The earlier outlook comes partly as the project is able to connect faster than was expected onto the grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC..Three Mile Island is one of two US nuclear plants that were shut down in recent years for economic reasons, but are now being revived to meet surging demand for power. Once operational, it will deliver electricity to Microsoft Corp., which needs carbon-free energy for its artificial intelligence systems..“We made a mistake shutting this plant down,” Constellation Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez said at event on Wednesday held at the plant site. “You just have to watch the grid the last few days to know how much we need this,” he said, referring to a heat wave sweeping the US that’s strained power supplies..US interest in nuclear energy is booming, driven by the growing need for electricity to power data centers, factories and increasingly electrified homes. New York announced Monday plans to build a new reactor in the state, and Holtec International is working to restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, which shut down in 2022. In May, President Donald Trump signed orders to help accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants..Three Mile Island has been renamed the Crane power plant, honoring a CEO of Constellation’s former parent company who died in 2024. Constellation is working to restart the Unit 1 reactor, which shut down in 2019. Unit 2, which was the site of a partial meltdown in 1979, is being decommissioned..Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro attended Wednesday’s event at the plant site..“In Pennsylvania, we’re taking big, bold, decisive steps to build new sources of energy,” Shapiro said. “I’m excited about how this power plant will reopen.”.(Updates with CEO comments in fourth paragraph and comments from Pennsylvania governor in final paragraph.).Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-mile-island-poised-deliver-143000778.html,"```json

NuScale is focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs), while Centrus Energy specializes in the enrichment of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which is a critical fuel source for powering SMRs in the future.Per Fortune Business Insight report, the global SMR market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, expanding at a CAGR of 4.98% from 2025 to 2032. Both Nuscale Power and Centrus Energy are likely to gain from the massive growth opportunity, as their technologies are poised to play a key role in meeting the rising global demand for safe, reliable, and carbon-free nuclear energy.So, SMR or LEU — Which of these Nuclear stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out..NuScale Power is benefiting from advancements in SMR technology. The company’s expanding partner base, which includes tech giants and financial institutions, positions SMR as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy. The company is gaining strong momentum across various sectors, especially as energy demands continue to rise. The increasing energy demand, driven by sectors like data centers, which require continuous, reliable, and carbon-free energy, has been a major growth driver.Data centers are expected to triple their energy use over the next three years, accounting for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. This growth trend presents a significant opportunity for NuScale Power, as its small modular reactor technology offers consistent, carbon-free energy that can meet the increasing demands of hyperscale data centers.NuScale Power continues to attract strong interest from major technology companies and infrastructure capital. Companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet and Oracle have made substantial commitments to using nuclear energy, including SMR technology, to meet their sustainability goals, which positively impacts NuScale Power’s market positioning..Centrus Energy is benefiting from increased demand for nuclear fuel, particularly HALEU, and from its role in developing and deploying advanced nuclear technologies like SMRs. HALEU is expected to play a significant role in fueling advanced reactors. The Department of Energy (DOE) has released supplies from its HALEU availability program to five advanced reactor developers, highlighting the growing demand for this type of uranium.LEU recently announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has extended its HALEU production contract through June 30, 2026, as part of Phase III of its ongoing agreement. This follows Centrus’ successful delivery of 20 kg of HALEU in Phase I and ongoing production of 900 kg under Phase II. The extension marks the start of a potential eight additional years of production to support advanced nuclear reactor development.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuscale-power-vs-centrus-energy-153500512.html,"```json

In the absence of federal regulation, states over the past few years have enacted dozens of new laws — curbing deepfakes, protecting artists, banning algorithmic discrimination — aimed at preventing harms from the nascent technology..The ban is a top priority for big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc. as well as venture capital firms, such as Andreessen Horowitz, which backs smaller but still powerful players.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-titans-struggle-rising-clout-140633970.html,"```json

AI shares have witnessed a sharp decline of 32.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decrease of 12.5%. At the same time frame, the S&P 500 has dropped 1%.The company’s stock has been pressured by persistently high costs despite top-line growth. Its consumption-based pricing model has increased pilot costs without guaranteed conversion. Transitioning contracts and customer acquisitions are expensive and margin-dilutive..C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on the operating margin.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.In the past month, the stock has witnessed a gain of 6.4% against the industry decline of 0.4%. The AI stock closed at $24.17 on Monday, still trading well below its 52-week high of $45.08 but above its low of $17.03. In the same time frame, other industry players, such as Asana, Inc.

Meanwhile, Asana and Braze’s sales in fiscal 2026 are likely to witness increases of 7.9% and 18.7%, respectively..C3.ai is gaining strong traction in the federal sector, with government partnerships emerging as key growth drivers. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the company reached a milestone, a $450-million contract ceiling from the U.S. Air Force for its PANDA predictive maintenance platform. Already deployed across various aircraft, PANDA’s latest expansion highlights C3.ai’s growing role in national defense systems..What sets the federal business apart is its broad agency adoption. C3.ai’s AI-driven platforms are now embedded across the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Missile Defense Agency. From enhancing supply-chain visibility in fuel operations to enabling predictive analytics for aircraft readiness, the company’s agentic AI and generative tools are delivering mission-critical, real-time insights across defense operations.C3.ai is intensifying its go-to-market focus by leaning heavily on its growing partner ecosystem.

CRM and Veeva Systems Inc. VEEV are two well-known names in the cloud customer relationship management (CRM) market. Both companies offer tools that help businesses manage customer relationships, but they serve very different markets. Salesforce is a global provider across industries, while Veeva focuses only on the life sciences sector, including pharmaceutical and biotech companies..As investors search for sustainable winners in enterprise tech, a deeper look into each company’s fundamentals, growth outlook and valuation helps determine which of these CRM stocks offers stronger long-term potential..Salesforce continues to dominate the CRM market, outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Over the years, Salesforce has built a strong and interconnected platform. The acquisition of Informatica, Zoomin and Own Company shows its intent to move beyond its position as a CRM software maker and become a broader enterprise software provider focused on artificial intelligence (AI), data and collaboration..AI is now central to Salesforce’s growth plan. Since rolling out Einstein GPT in 2023, the company has embedded generative AI into its platform to help businesses automate processes, improve decisions and offer better customer experiences. As AI adoption rises across industries, Salesforce is well-placed to benefit from the same..Its latest innovation, Agentforce, reflects that momentum. Paired with its Data Cloud, Agentforce has already hit $100 million in annualized revenues just two quarters after launch. More than 4,000 customers are using it for various tasks in sales, service and marketing. Data Cloud is also expanding fast, with annual recurring revenues growing more than 120% year over year. Salesforce’s broader strategy of bringing apps, data and AI agents under one umbrella gives it a strong edge..However, Salesforce’s biggest challenge right now is slowing sales growth. For years, the company has delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%..Salesforce Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Salesforce Inc.

He said: “CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED! Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL. On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR.” This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will! God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!”.Israel later accused Iran of what it described as a “severe violation” of President Donald Trump’s ceasefire,  a charge Iran denies, NBC News reports. Trump acknowledged that both Iran and Israel violated the ceasefire, telling a group of reporters that he is going to see if he can stop the ceasefire violations. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f— they’re doing,” he said..FED RATE SHOULD BE LOWER: On Monday night, President Donald Trump posted to Truth Social: “Too Late” Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate. Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy – We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus. What a difference this would make. If things later change to the negative, increase the Rate. I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come. THE BOARD SHOULD ACTIVATE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-trade-trump-slams-powell-134130286.html,"```json

Eric Woodruff, Semperis' Chief Identity Architect, presented his findings this week at the Troopers 2025 in Heidelberg, Germany.","nOAuth continues to go undetected by SaaS vendors, who may not even know what to look for and it is nearly impossible for enterprise customers to defend against, allowing attackers to take over accounts and exfiltrate data..HOBOKEN, N.J., June 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Semperis, a provider of AI-powered identity security and cyber resilience, today released new research into nOauth known vulnerability in Microsoft's Entra ID that enables full account takeover in vulnerable SaaS apps with minimal attacker effort, posing a severe risk to enterprises relying on cross-tenant Entra integrations. Eric Woodruff, Semperis' Chief Identity Architect, presented his findings this week at the Troopers 2025 in Heidelberg, Germany..nOAuth was first disclosed in 2023 by Omer Cohen of Descope, highlighting a flaw in how some SaaS applications implement OpenID Connect. Semperis' follow-up research focused on Entra-integrated applications in Microsoft's Entra Application Gallery, identifying a wide range of applications still vulnerable to nOAuth abuse more than a year later..Discovered through cross-tenant testing, nOAuth exploits Entra ID app configurations that permit unverified email claims as user identifiers, a known anti-pattern per OpenID Connect standards. In these scenarios, attackers need only an Entra tenant and the target's email address to assume control of the victim's SaaS account. Traditional safeguards like MFA, conditional access, and Zero Trust policies offer no protection..""It's easy for well-meaning developers to follow insecure patterns without realizing it and in many cases, they don't even know what to look for,"" said Woodruff. ""Meanwhile, customers are left with no way to detect or stop the attack, making this an especially dangerous and persistent threat."".Safeguarding Against the nOAuth Vulnerability.In a broad test of more than 100 Entra-integrated SaaS applications, Woodruff found nearly 10% were vulnerable to nOAuth abuse. Once the vulnerability is exploited, attackers can gain full access to a user's account in the SaaS app, enabling data exfiltration, persistence, and potential lateral movement. The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) advises SaaS vendors to follow its recommendations to prevent nOAuth abuse or risk expulsion from the Entra Application Gallery..""nOAuth abuse is a serious threat that many organizations may be exposed to,"" continued Woodruff. ""It's low effort, leaves almost no trace and bypasses end–user protections. We've confirmed exploitation is still possible in many SaaS apps, which makes this an urgent call to action. We encourage developers to implement the necessary fixes and help protect their customers before this flaw is exploited further.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/semperis-research-uncovers-ongoing-risk-133000230.html,"```json

Local AI developers, such as China’s DeepSeek, are showing that Asian AI models are sitting on the technological frontier..“This funding round isn’t about necessity; it’s about ambition,” CEO Venkat Rangapuram said in a statement. “This investment turbocharges our mission: to empower enterprises with AI systems that are resilient, agile, and meticulously fine-tuned.”.Centific plans to use the funds to expand the functionality of its platform, improve its research and development, and deepen its collaboration with partners like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Lenovo..The AI startup works with larger businesses to develop, train, and deploy their AI, including trying to eliminate bias, hallucinations, and other mistakes. “Unless the model is grounded in very specific scenarios and datasets, it can’t really solve enterprise-related issues,” Rangapuram said in a conversation with Fortune. “There’s a whole lot of things that need to be thought about before you can go live in an enterprise setup.”.Centific started as the U.S. division of Pactera, a Chinese IT consulting and outsourcing firm. After Chinese Electronics Corp., a Chinese state-owned company, acquired Pactera in 2020, it carved out the U.S. business, which eventually became an independent company..Rangapuram told Fortune that he was intrigued by the “disruptive and exciting possibilities” of physical AI, particularly in ASEAN and Singapore. (“Physical AI” refers to models designed to work with real-world machinery, like manufacturing equipment.) “The future is not just in North America, it’s global,” he said..The wish to expand to new markets was why Centific turned to Granite Asia and famed venture capitalist (and MPW Asia listee) Jenny Lee, one of the fund’s senior managing partners. Rangapuram pointed to Granite’s “network and resources within Asia and India” as part of the reason why he turned to Lee and her fund “as we diversify from the North American market into alternate markets around the globe.”.Granite Asia, in turn, sees the Centific investment as part of its mission to build “enduring infrastructure for the future of industry,” Lee said in a statement accompanying the funding announcement. Centific “is uniquely positioned to become a foundational partner in the enterprise AI stack.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-vc-granite-asia-leads-130000605.html,"```json

114,2025-06-25 19:59:00,Is AMD Stock Finally Winning Over Wall Street?,Advanced Micro Devices has been upgraded twice this week as the stock outperforms the broader market.,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a semiconductor giant in its own right, though the company has been left in the dust by rival Nvidia’s (NVDA) explosive rise in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. However, AMD has shown some remarkable strength lately, with the chip stock up 9.5% in the past 5 days following multiple positive catalysts and analyst upgrades..Melius Research on Monday upgraded AMD to ""Buy"" with a $175 price target, with the firm projecting a “sustainable surge in inferencing.” And on Tuesday, CFRA Research raised the semiconductor stock to ""Strong Buy"" with a $165 price target, as analyst Angelo Zino wrote to clients that “we see AMD closing the competitive gap to NVIDIA (NVDA) in 2026 as it launches the MI400x.”.Super Micro Computer Just Struck a Deal with Ericsson.

A strategic partnership with HCLTech to develop AI and cloud solutions, coupled with a $10 billion infrastructure investment partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain, demonstrates AMD’s commitment to expanding its global enterprise presence..The upcoming MI400 series and Helios rack-scale system are generating significant optimism among analysts, who predict the company's earnings per share could exceed $8 within two years. While AMD currently trails Nvidia in the AI chip market, recent product improvements and partnerships are helping to close this competitive gap..More broadly, the semiconductor industry outlook remains positive, with projections indicating an expansion from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028. CEO Lisa Su's vision of the AI accelerator market exceeding $500 billion by 2028 appears increasingly achievable, given the company's current trajectory and strategic positioning.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-stock-finally-winning-over-115922315.html,"```json

While companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which develop top-tier AI models, generate a lot of headlines, there are plenty of publicly traded companies successfully riding the AI wave as well.  Two prime examples are Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), both of which look like great AI bets.","Oracle's cloud-computing business is accelerating as it taps into AI computing demand..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is benefiting from booming demand for AI chips..Both stocks look like AI winners..10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a game-changing technology with the potential to disrupt industries and deliver massive productivity gains. While companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which develop top-tier AI models, generate a lot of headlines, there are plenty of publicly traded companies successfully riding the AI wave as well. Two prime examples are Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), both of which look like great AI bets..As Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure became the top two players in the public cloud-computing market, Oracle was largely left out. However, soaring demand for AI computing capacity has changed the story. Oracle has been rapidly building out AI-enabled data centers, and the results have been impressive..Oracle's cloud-infrastructure revenue surged by 52% year over year in the final quarter of fiscal 2025 to $3 billion. That's still small relative to the market leaders, but Oracle is growing much faster. Amazingly, growth is set to accelerate. Oracle expects cloud-infrastructure revenue to grow by more than 70% in fiscal 2026 as more data centers come online and its infrastructure investments pay off..The cloud-infrastructure business is now large enough that Oracle's overall revenue growth is likely to accelerate in fiscal 2026 thanks to that blockbuster growth. Revenue was up 8% in fiscal 2025 to $57.4 billion, and it should accelerate to double digits in fiscal 2026..Beyond cloud infrastructure, Oracle's cloud-software business is also growing swiftly. Overall, cloud-application revenue rose by 12% in the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion, with both Fusion Cloud ERP and NetSuite Cloud ERP reaching the $1 billion market. This is offsetting lower on-premise software license revenue and weaker growth in hardware and services..Oracle has undoubtedly found its niche in the cloud-infrastructure market, and it's aggressively building out more capacity to meet demand. As long as the AI boom continues, Oracle is set to be an unlikely AI winner..Essentially, all the AI accelerators powering the AI revolution, from Nvidia, AMD, and others, are manufactured by TSMC. As tech giants increasingly design their own AI chips, TSMC is the manufacturer of choice. For the first five months of 2025, TSMC's revenue has risen by more than 42% year over year as demand for AI chips soars.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-hot-stocks-riding-ai-103500254.html,"```json

But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems.

That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives..The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns..DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms..If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE).

Removals from these projects will be among the first issued under ACR’s IFM v2.1 protocol, a next-generation methodology that advances the field via dynamic baselines, enhanced additionality and monitoring requirements, improved quantification accuracy, and increased transparency..At the heart of this initiative is Anew’s Epoch Evaluation Platform, a proprietary system that leverages machine learning, high-resolution satellite imagery, drone data, and ground-based field measurements to enable ongoing, location-specific tracking and validation of forest carbon baselines, surpassing the requirements of the IFM v2.1 methodology. In partnership with Aurora, Anew designed a custom project that exceeds registry mandates and meets Microsoft’s high standards for durability and integrity, featuring extended monitoring, tech-enabled quantification, perpetual working forest easements and covenants. Collectively, this marks the largest permanent working forest protection project in the eastern U.S. in two decades..""This agreement sets a new standard for nature-based carbon removals, pairing technical rigor with environmental stewardship at scale,"" said Angela Schwarz, Chief Executive Officer of Anew Climate.

To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia..Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage..Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares..Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-070000205.html,"```json

In this article, we will summarize the Bears’ thesis on AI. C3.ai, Inc.'s share was trading at $23.41 as of June 23rd..A scientist at a computer station, surrounded by a neural network of artificial intelligence code..C3.ai has struggled to gain solid financial footing despite being in business for over 15 years and forming high-profile partnerships with Microsoft Azure and McKinsey. While its revenue growth has reached 24% on a trailing twelve-month basis, the company continues to operate inefficiently, posting net losses that hover around 80% of revenue and maintaining negative cash flow. With a Rule of 40 score of just 14%, the business model remains fundamentally flawed..A major concern is C3.ai’s reliance on a limited customer base, most notably Baker Hughes, which contributes around 20% of total revenue. This key contract is set for renewal and may expire as early as June 2025, posing a significant risk to the company’s financial stability and stock performance. For fiscal year 2025, C3.ai is projected to generate nearly $400 million in sales while incurring a $300 million loss, a mismatch that renders its $2.5 billion valuation difficult to justify..The market appears to share this skepticism, as evidenced by a 30% drop in the stock year-to-date. Furthermore, substantial insider selling by CEO Tom Siebel and his management team reinforces concerns about internal confidence. Short sellers have also targeted the stock aggressively, as reflected in its elevated short interest levels..Tools like the stocks. Guide screener reveals that C3.ai is among the most shorted stocks in the NASDAQ-100, underscoring bearish sentiment. Overall, the company remains an unprofitable and risky bet, with mounting pressure from both operational inefficiencies and investor skepticism..Previously, we covered a bearish thesis on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) by Magnus Ofstad in May 2025, which highlighted concerns over slowing growth and stretched valuation. The company’s stock price has appreciated by approximately 8% since our coverage. This is because the thesis didn’t play out as expected. Stefan Waldhauser shares a similar view but emphasizes C3.ai’s structurally weaker fundamentals..C3.ai, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 24 hedge fund portfolios held AI at the end of the first quarter which was 25 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Without a clear plan, organizations risk leaving gaps in their defenses and overspending on tools they don't need. To help leaders align security capabilities with their actual organizational needs, global research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published new research insights and guidance for building a robust security architecture with Microsoft technologies..TORONTO, June 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Global research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group's recently published research insights articulate that many organizations have access to a wide range of Microsoft's powerful security features yet still struggle with overlap, underuse, and unclear integration. While turning on a security tool can be easy, building a secure and well-structured architecture with Microsoft technologies requires IT strategy and clarity.

In this environment, organizations are increasingly looking to standardize their security platforms to simplify management, reduce costs, and improve their overall security posture,"" says Fred Chagnon, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group.  ""Though Microsoft provides a comprehensive suite of security products, users of the product struggle to map all these provided capabilities to their own unique needs. The result is suboptimal deployment leading to security defense gaps, unintentional technology complexity, and wasted spending."".Keeping pace with frequent product changes, shifting licensing models, tool integration challenges, and internal silos remains a significant challenge for many organizations. Info-Tech's newly published research highlights how best to navigate Microsoft's vast and constantly evolving security landscape..According to Chagnon, one of the firm's cybersecurity experts, approaches that focus solely on cost consolidation can fall short, as they risk overlooking critical security gaps. To address this, he recommends in the firm's new blueprint that taking a capability-first approach breaks down the Microsoft security stack into manageable components, which can help organizations align tools with real security needs rather than just budgets.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lost-microsofts-security-tools-tech-203100685.html,"```json

GTLB’s trailing and forward P/E were 458.11 and 54.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..A software engineer working on coding a mobile app from their workstation..GitLab stands out in the DevSecOps landscape by positioning itself as an AI-native platform built for enterprise-grade needs in an increasingly regulated and cloud-diverse world. Unlike GitHub, which is deeply embedded within Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem, GitLab offers cloud neutrality with the flexibility to run across AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises environments..This appeals especially to government entities and organizations requiring dedicated SaaS instances, with GitLab recently achieving FedRAMP certification—a move that unlocks large-scale federal contracts. GitLab Duo, the company's AI-native suite, embeds contextual intelligence throughout the software lifecycle..Features like Duo Workflow and Duo Enterprise aim to automate multi-step developer tasks, offer test generation and root cause analysis, and ease deployment, all signaling GitLab's evolution from a DevOps tool to the operational backbone of modern software factories. Despite a deceleration in revenue growth from 36% in FY24 to an expected 25% in FY26, GitLab’s fundamentals remain strong with a near 90% gross margin and improving cash flow now that a major tax-related one-time hit is behind it..At a $41 share price, the stock trades at 6x forward sales—its lowest valuation since IPO—yet remains attractively priced relative to SaaS peers. Alphabet’s venture arm, GV recently exited its stake, dampening takeover speculation, but GitLab’s strategic value appears undiminished..With a growing foothold among enterprise customers and an increasingly integrated AI product suite, GitLab is positioned as a long-term structural winner in software development. Investors betting on the future of AI-enabled DevSecOps may find GitLab’s current valuation an appealing entry point..Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on GitLab Inc. by Compounding Your Wealth in April 2025, emphasizing strong financials, enterprise traction, and AI-led product growth.

The things we do matter a lot for people’s lives, and that really concentrates the mind."".""You want to just stay focused on that task as long as you’re sitting in these chairs that we occupy. Focus on that task. Do what you think is the right thing and take the consequences."".'Well-positioned to wait'.Earlier in his testimony, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank can afford to hold interest rates steady for now. In prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee, he said, ""For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance."".Beyond addressing political pressure, Powell also spoke to broader economic challenges facing the Fed, including the impact of tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East..On inflation, he acknowledged the potential effects of trade: ""At this time all forecasters are expecting pretty soon that that some significant inflation will show up from tariffs"" Powell said, referencing the Fed’s latest projections of higher inflation and slower economic growth compared to March's forecast..As for the conflict between Israel and Iran, Powell urged caution: ""It's too early to know what any economic implications might be.

137,2025-06-25 01:07:00,Meta Launches Xbox Edition of Its Quest VR Headset,Meta's looking to make a bigger push into VR gaming.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Meta’s looking to boost the appeal of VR gaming, with a new Xbox-branded Meta Quest bundle, created in partnership with Microsoft, which will enable gamers to get their hands on a limited edition, Xbox-themed Quest headset..As you can see in this example, the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition comes in a sleek-looking black colorway, and includes a matching Xbox controller in the set. .But not an Xbox itself. .As per Meta:.“Today, Meta and Xbox are teaming up to unveil the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition - a celebration of Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) on Quest. Retailing for $US399.99, this limited edition bundle includes a custom 128GB Meta Quest 3S in signature Xbox Carbon Black and Velocity Green with matching Touch Plus controllers, a limited edition Xbox controller, an Elite Strap, and a 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.”.So, to clarify, the regular price of a Meta Quest 3S headset is $US299, while an Xbox One controller costs around $US49.99. Add to this the 3-months of Xbox Live access ($US24.99) and it’s not actually a bargain, in terms of price. But the color looks cool, and you can bet that some Xbox fans will be keen to purchase the limited edition design, as part of their gaming set-up..And as Meta points out, Meta Quest already integrates Xbox functionality, effectively: .“Meta Quest is an Xbox - and has been for a couple of years now, ever since we partnered with Microsoft to launch the Xbox app on Quest. Put on your Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, and you can play hundreds of Xbox games like South of Midnight, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Avowed, and Towerborne on a larger-than-life screen. And of course, you can play all the incredible immersive experiences across gaming and entertainment from the Meta Horizon Store.”.Yeah, in terms of value, it’s not actually that great of a package, but really, the pitch here is not that this is a great deal, as such, but rather that this is a better alternative than buying an Xbox..Which seems like a bit of a conflict for Microsoft, but presumably, it's getting a fair share of revenue from the collaboration..And again, it’s another means for Meta to boost the appeal of its VR headset with the gaming community, by integrating its advanced headset with Xbox more directly, and inviting gamers to accessorize their set-up with a VR unit. .And while Meta has broader ambitions for its VR experience, gaming remains a key gateway for adoption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-launches-xbox-edition-quest-170738470.html,"{

The company's proprietary supercomputers, full suite of AI solutions, and competitive pricing mean that revenues will soar in the coming years.","Zacks Rank #3 stock Nebius Group (NBIS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure company that offers its customers a full-stack AI solution. Currently, Nebius AI is benefitting from the hottest and fastest-growing area on Wall Street – AI infrastructure. Essentially, the company provides the backbone and compute power for companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) that are building the most powerful AI systems in the world, like the ChatGPT and Gemini large language models (LLMs). Building and training these complex, technologically advanced AI systems requires a massive amount of computer power and equipment..In simple terms, Nebius is akin to a specialized electricity company, but rather than providing power, the company provides the lightning-fast computer power and technology needed for AI. However, what makes Nebius special and unique is how they offer their products:.·       NBIS has its own supercomputers: Nebius builds and operates its own data centers that it fills with the latest and most advanced graphic processing units (GPUS). In other words, rather than building their own data centers and setting up the complex AI technology themselves, big tech companies like Microsoft can rely on NBIS data centers and use them as a service..·       NBIS has competitive pricing: Because Nebius is focused solely on AI solutions, the company can provide more competitive pricing than general cloud providers, for example..·       NBIS offers supplemental products: Nebius’s laser-focus on AI also allows the company to offer a full suite of products that extend beyond just compute power. Its add-on software solutions make running AI models simpler and more efficient..Nebius AI builds proprietary hardware like servers and racks, allowing it to vertically integrate its business. In addition, NBIS has partnered with Nvidia (NVDA) (the top AI chip company) to leverage the industry-best Nvidia GPUs and access powerful ‘GPU clusters’ to run AI models at scale. Meanwhile, Nebius also has an essential partnership with big tech juggernaut Meta Platforms (META). Meta leverages NBIS technology to train its Llama large language model. While the details of the partnership are under wraps, investors should not underestimate the significance of the partnership. META and its iconic CEO Mark Zuckerberg not only spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI, Zuckerberg is so serious about AI that recent reports claim that he has been poaching top AI talent from other AI leaders, offering staggering $100 million pay packages as incentive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nebius-ai-infrastructure-leader-165900988.html,"```json

Despite claims of encryption and compliance, both platforms fail under real-world conditions that could expose sensitive information without the sender or receiver knowing..The report, How Microsoft and Google Put PHI at Risk, details a series of controlled experiments in which messages sent from both platforms were delivered either using obsolete encryption protocols or unencrypted in cleartext. In all test cases, the sender was never notified of the failure—there was no bounce, no alert, and no visible log..A test of real-world encryption.The Paubox research team simulated how email behaves when sent to outdated or noncompliant servers—a realistic scenario in healthcare, where digital infrastructure is often fragmented across clinics, vendors, and legacy systems..Google Workspace still transmits emails using obsolete encryption protocols like TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1—versions explicitly prohibited by the NSA..Microsoft 365 silently delivers emails in cleartext when encryption cannot be negotiated, exposing sensitive data to potential interception with no warning to senders or recipients..In both cases, there was no bounce, no alert, and no audit trail. The only evidence was buried in the message headers..Outdated TLS configurations and certificate mismanagement are consistently listed among the top security risks, even in API environments..Critically, these weren’t configuration mistakes..Cleartext delivery and outdated encryption put data at risk.This isn’t just a healthcare problem. Any organization relying on Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace for email encryption could be unknowingly exposing sensitive information.

The two companies are currently negotiating a restructuring of OpenAI’s for-profit operations, with both sides seeking favorable terms..The planned features would resemble functions offered by Microsoft’s Office 365 and Google’s Workspace, two dominant software suites in business IT that have already incorporated generative AI tools into their platforms..Beyond document collaboration, OpenAI appears to be developing a broader ecosystem including a browser, an AI-powered hardware device, and a social content feed within ChatGPT. These initiatives suggest the company is seeking greater control over how users create, access, and share content online..For enterprise customers who currently use ChatGPT as a standalone tool, these integrated productivity applications could make the platform a more central component of company workflows.

Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage.. .Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares.. .Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-vs-nvidia-ai-stock-161500955.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter. .The Fintech Open Source Foundation, called FINOS, launched a coordinated effort to unite the banking industry and technology providers around vendor-neutral AI adoption standards for financial services companies, according to a Tuesday announcement..Several global banking heavyweights, including BMO, Citi, Morgan Stanley and RBC will work with hyperscalers AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud to establish Common Controls for AI Services, the nonprofit industry organization said in the announcement. Goldman Sachs and Red Hat are also supporting the project..As the financial industry ramped up AI adoption, FINOS members formed an AI readiness working group to deliver the first draft of a risk mitigation framework last year. Those efforts are ongoing and will remain separate from the controls initiative, which will aim to produce a real-time compliance validation toolkit for developers, the organization said..In the absence of clear and consistent regulatory oversight of AI and its commercial use, banks are forging open-source adoption standards that can be applied across the financial industry..The mobilization around AI mirrors a successful campaign spearheaded by Citi to rationalize compliance, resilience and security standards for public cloud deployments..With broad support from financial services firms and technology providers, FINOS open sourced its Common Cloud Controls in October 2023. The protocol unified controls across major providers and created standard classifications for common cloud services and threats..Many of the cloud concerns FINOS addressed were also raised by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which launched a Cloud Services Steering Group in May 2023 to establish a common lexicon for financial institutions and regulators and create safe migration roadmaps for the industry..The Treasury Department weighed in on AI adoption in banking, too, issuing a March 2024 report warning of cyber risks and recommending financial firms adhere to compliance with existing laws and regulations..While laws pertaining to transaction reporting, data privacy and other banking functions abound, the AI regulatory climate has cooled under President Donald Trump..The current administration, which has taken a laissez faire position on the technology, proposed a 10-year freeze on AI regulatory action by individual states.

Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW)'s share was trading at $75.8 as of 10th June. EW’s trailing and forward P/E were 31.55 and 31.25 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a global leader in structural heart therapies, generating 60% of its revenue internationally and maintaining a focused mission on treating advanced cardiovascular disease..With a 20-year track record of 14.5% annual growth, the company trades at a 32x P/E, a valuation level akin to Microsoft, though with comparatively slower growth. This premium suggests the market sees a durable moat, albeit a narrow one, anchored in intangible assets such as a respected brand and clinical leadership in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology. Moderate switching costs further reinforce this position, as physicians tend to stick with TAVR systems after overcoming steep learning curves..While the company lacks cost advantages, network effects, or efficient scale, it remains highly modelable, with limited earnings volatility and consistent operational performance. Its fair value estimate sits around $84, based on projected 2025–2026 EPS and historical multiples, implying the current share price offers an 8% discount and modest total return expectations of 25% (or ~9% annually)..What sets Edwards apart is exceptional capital discipline and management. It maintains a conservative balance sheet, prioritizes internal innovation with industry-leading R&D investment, and has a history of strategic, early-stage acquisitions that support future growth in mitral and tricuspid valve markets. Though it does not pay a dividend, its opportunistic buyback strategy reflects prudent capital return. Risks include its smaller scale versus major medtech peers, though this is offset by operational agility..Overall, Edwards is a high-quality company trading at a premium due to its niche leadership and disciplined execution, despite moderating growth..Previously, we highlighted a bullish thesis on Edwards Lifesciences (EW) by Natan on Substack, emphasizing its leadership in TAVR, growth runway in mitral and tricuspid markets, and long-term margin expansion potential.

CoreWeave provides GPU-accelerated infrastructure for AI. Its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support and accelerate GenAI. Microsoft is both a major customer of CRWV and a competitor through Azure’s AI services..So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in the AI infrastructure space, which stock stands out? Let us delve a little deeper into the companies’ strengths and weaknesses to see which is the better stock pick..CRWV works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200 and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. CoreWeave now has a data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power..CRWV is witnessing explosive revenue growth on strong AI demand. In the last earnings call, management highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. In the last reported quarter, revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave..CRWV’s strong backlog of $25.9 billion underscores its growing market share. This includes a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion, while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter..Nonetheless, the competitive landscape is the biggest concern.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is using AI-powered code-completion tools to help developers write code 55% faster.  Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is leveraging AI to accelerate drug-discovery timelines.,"Boring dividend stocks are becoming the smartest way to profit from AI's efficiency revolution..Companies using AI to slash costs and boost margins can sustain higher dividend payouts for decades..These five dividend payers offer current income plus the upside of AI-driven margin expansion..10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›.When companies deploy artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline operations, the results can be staggering. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is using AI-powered code-completion tools to help developers write code 55% faster. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is leveraging AI to accelerate drug-discovery timelines. IBM (NYSE: IBM) reported over $1 billion in generative AI revenue in a single quarter. These efficiency gains translate directly to the bottom line, creating sustainable cost savings that can flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks..Consider what happens when a company with $100 billion in revenue uses AI to improve efficiency by just 5%. That's $5 billion in cost savings flowing straight to the bottom line -- money that can fund dividend increases, share buybacks, and further AI investments. This virtuous cycle of AI deployment leading to margin expansion leading to shareholder rewards is already playing out across multiple industries. The five companies below have figured out how to turn AI from a buzzword into a profit-generating machine that benefits patient dividend investors..Microsoft offers a modest 0.68% yield today, but don't let that fool you. With a rock-solid 24.4% payout ratio, the company has massive room to grow its dividend as AI supercharges its business. Microsoft isn't just selling AI through Azure and its OpenAI partnership -- it's using AI internally to optimize everything from coding to customer service. When a company generating $245 billion in annual revenue finds ways to boost efficiency by even 10%, that's $24.5 billion in potential savings flowing straight to the bottom line..IBM yields 2.38% and has raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years, though its 114.2% payout ratio demands attention. The company's aggressive pivot to AI and hybrid cloud is already bearing fruit, with generative AI revenue jumping over $1 billion in the third quarter of 2024 alone. While the high payout ratio suggests IBM is stretching to maintain its long dividend growth streak, the AI-driven revenue growth could quickly bring that ratio back to sustainable levels. Watson's evolution from a game show novelty to an enterprise AI powerhouse shows IBM still has innovation in its DNA.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-stocks-poised-profit-120000767.html,"```json

It's the technological innovation of our age -- one that will alter the course of humanity for the foreseeable future..Want definitive proof? Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly willing to pay $100 million in bonus packages to poach top AI talent from rivals, personally sending WhatsApp messages to hundreds of researchers and hosting them at his homes to close deals. When one of the world's richest CEOs abandons his executive suite to become his company's chief recruiter, you know you're witnessing something far more substantial than dot-com era vaporware..While everyone obsesses over which company will build the first superintelligence, the smartest money is quietly accumulating positions in the companies that will profit regardless of which company wins. Think of it this way: During the California Gold Rush, the prospectors went bust -- but the folks selling picks and shovels got rich..Today's AI revolution follows the same playbook. The following five stocks are perfectly positioned to profit from every dollar spent in this technological arms race..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) gets all the AI chip headlines, but the real story is its transformation into a full-stack AI computing company.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily HR Dive newsletter. .Workers now face a “seemingly infinite workday,” where they scan emails before getting out of bed in the morning, attend countless meetings throughout the day and catch up on work during the evenings and weekends, according to a June 17 report from Microsoft..For instance, mass emails with 20 or more recipients have increased 7% in the past year, Teams messages per person grew 6% year over year globally, and evening meetings held after 8 p.m. have increased 16% year over year as well..“This points to a larger truth: the modern workday for many has no clear start or finish,” according to the report. “As business demands grow more complex and expectations continue to rise, time once reserved for focus or recovery may now be spent catching up, prepping and chasing clarity.”.Based on Microsoft data, employees receive an average of 117 emails per day and 153 Teams messages per workday. About 57% of meetings are ad hoc, or called in the moment without a calendar invitation..Half of meetings take place between 9-11 a.m. and 1-3 p.m., which are considered the most productive hours for workers based on their circadian rhythms. Message activity also increases during the time, leaving little time for deep focus work, Microsoft said..Telemetry data indicates that employees using Microsoft 365 are interrupted every two minutes by a meeting, email or chat notification, adding up to 275 times per day..In the evening, 29% of employees check their email again after 10 p.m. Nearly 20% of employees actively working on the weekend tend to check their email before noon on Saturday and Sunday. More than 5% also check email on Sunday evenings..Overall, 1 in 3 employees said the pace of work during the past five years has “made it impossible to keep up,” Microsoft said..In response, employers should question how time is spent, how work gets done and what really drives impact, according to the report. For instance, companies can use the 80/20 Pareto principle to focus on the 20% of efforts that deliver 80% of the outcomes. This requires setting boundaries and prioritizing deep work, the report indicated..Microsoft also recommended redesigning organizational charts to focus on goals and outcomes rather than traditional silos. As part of this, departments can incorporate artificial intelligence tools to develop insights, draft reports and fill gaps, according to the report.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-expectations-grow-workers-battle-110500336.html,"```json

Here are two top stocks to consider adding to your portfolio right now..ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is playing a pivotal role in helping companies transform their operations for AI. Its cloud-based platform offers powerful tools that can automate and streamline workflows..ServiceNow generates recurring revenue from subscriptions, which means lower business risk compared to companies that have to sell more products every year to generate growth. Over the last 10 years, revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 32%, with free cash flow growing at 44%. This fueled a 1,100% cumulative return in the share price. Its recent quarterly revenue growth rate suggest there is still massive market potential for its platform..In the first quarter, subscription revenue grew 19% year over year to $3 billion, or an increase of 20% excluding currency changes. Importantly, remaining performance obligations grew 25% over the year-ago quarter to $22 billion, indicating excellent long-term growth prospects..ServiceNow is integrating AI across its platform, improving efficiency and productivity, which companies are desperately seeking to stay competitive. The company is moving beyond its historical focus on information technology solutions to expand into supply chain and customer relationship management offerings..These additional services are making the platform more robust to attract larger enterprises, and it's paying off. ServiceNow now has more than 500 customers with an annual contract value of $5 million or more..Management believes the opportunity for the company is accelerating. It sees a clear path to reach annual revenue of $30 billion. That represents significant growth over the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $11.5 billion..ServiceNow's history of growth, subscription-based business model, and momentum from AI integration make it a quality growth stock to hold for the long term..Another stock to invest in AI without taking a lot of risk is the long-reigning software king, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Microsoft's transformation over the last decade into a cloud-first company has significantly strengthened its competitive moat and positioned it well for the AI era.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-081500442.html,"```json

The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.96%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.89%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.94%..Shares of the software maker have appreciated by 6.05% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.53%, and the S&P 500's gain of 0.5%..Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Microsoft in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $3.35, showcasing a 13.56% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $73.71 billion, indicating a 13.88% upward movement from the same quarter last year..For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $13.36 per share and a revenue of $279.09 billion, demonstrating changes of +13.22% and +13.86%, respectively, from the preceding year..Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the business and profitability..Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system..The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)..Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Microsoft has a Forward P/E ratio of 35.74 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.16, so one might conclude that Microsoft is trading at a premium comparatively..We can additionally observe that MSFT currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.42.

Analysts viewed the move as a smart step, both financially and strategically. Today, the dividend is seen as one of Microsoft’s key strengths. What began as a $0.16 per share payout has since grown to $0.83 per share..A development team working together to create the next version of Windows..This level of dividend growth is particularly impressive for a company rooted in the growth-oriented tech sector. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s five-year dividend growth rate of 10.3% shows that it’s possible to balance both income and expansion..While its 20-year streak of dividend increases often flies under the radar, especially with a yield of less than 1% at current prices, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s dividend outlook remains strong. The company has a healthy balance sheet, with more cash than debt and a low payout ratio, giving it plenty of room to continue raising dividends well into the future. In addition, the stock has delivered a return of nearly 955% in the past decade, outperforming the broader market, which returned just 183% during this period..While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

In April 2025, xAI launched Grok Studio, a split-screen workspace that lets users collaborate with Grok on generating documents, code, reports, and browser games. It also launched the ability to create Workspaces that let you organize files and conversations in a single place..While OpenAI and Microsoft have similar tools, Google’s Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building. Google’s tools can edit Docs and Sheets and allow you to chat with Gemini while looking at or editing documents. The difference is that Gemini Workspace only works within Google’s ecosystem..It’s not clear what types of files xAI’s editor might support aside from spreadsheets, or whether xAI plans to build a full productivity suite that could compete with Google Workspace or Microsoft 365..If Owji’s findings are true, the advanced editor would be a step toward Elon Musk’s ambitions to turn X into an “everything app” that includes docs, chat, payments, and social media.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leak-reveals-grok-might-soon-181657484.html,"```json

All seven stocks are included in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, and they often drive the market's performance with their size, growth, and influence..But after years of big gains, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their luster. Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which is vulnerable to high tariffs, competition, and supply chain constraints. Amazon faces stiff competition from cheaper cross-border competitors, Alphabet's Google is being slammed by antitrust regulators and struggling to keep pace with OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) services, and Microsoft might be headed for an ugly breakup with OpenAI as the AI start-up openly rebels against its top investor. As for Tesla, Elon Musk's divisive actions are likely driving away its potential customers in the saturated EV market..Meta and Nvidia face fewer near-term headwinds than the other five stocks. However, Meta generates nearly all of its revenue from ads, and its growth could slow down as the global economy cools off. Nvidia certainly isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but the secular expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset a lot of that pressure. So looking ahead, I believe Nvidia will continue to shatter Wall Street's expectations and outperform the other Magnificent Seven stocks for the foreseeable future..Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. It designs its own chips, but it outsources its manufacturing to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. With that ""fabless"" model, Nvidia doesn't need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade its own foundries or develop the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient manufacturing nodes..Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, which can also be used to mine certain cryptocurrencies. But in its latest quarter, it generated less than 9% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs. A whopping 89% came from its data center GPUs -- which include its older A100 chips and current-gen H100 and H200 chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/predict-magnificent-seven-stock-crush-163300908.html,"```json

NBIS has captured investor attention with its explosive growth and ambitious 2025 targets of $750 million to $1 billion in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) and $500–$700 million in total revenues. Following a remarkable 385% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025 and a 700% surge in ARR, the company appears well-positioned to pursue its goals. ARR reached $310 million in April, indicating strong momentum for the second quarter..The company is gaining from solid growth in its core artificial intelligence (AI) business. As organizations increasingly invest in generative AI, Nebius is benefiting from a full-stack approach, offering everything from high-performance GPU cloud infrastructure to Saturn Cloud’s MLOps platform and AI development tools..Backed by a $700 million funding round involving high-profile investors like NVIDIA and Accel in December 2024, Nebius is expanding aggressively in North America and Europe. It aims to leverage this capital to meet customer demand while maintaining flexibility in pricing and cost management. In June 2025, NBIS announced private placement of $1 billion in convertible notes to capitalize on the AI-infrastructure boom and drive-up revenue opportunities in 2026..The company holds a minority stake of approximately 28% in ClickHouse.

173,2025-06-23 21:30:00,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Microsoft (MSFT): Should You Buy?,"According to the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), one should invest in Microsoft (MSFT). It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT)..Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.28, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.28 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 38 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80.9% and 10.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>.The ABR suggests buying Microsoft, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133002074.html,"```json

175,2025-06-23 21:13:00,C3.ai Ramps Up Partner-Led Sales Model: Can It Drive Scalable Growth?,AI's accelerating partner-led strategy with tech giants like Microsoft is driving sharp deal growth in fiscal 2025.,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is doubling down on a go-to-market strategy centered around its rapidly expanding partner ecosystem. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the company secured 73% of its agreements in collaboration with strategic partners like Microsoft, AWS and Google Cloud. In fiscal 2025, it signed 193 deals through the partner ecosystem, reflecting a rise of 68% from the prior year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, AI reported a 419% surge in partner-supported bookings, with 59 agreements closed through strategic alliances.In the fiscal fourth quarter, C3.ai closed 59 partner-led deals. The company’s deepened alliance with Microsoft is noteworthy. Its applications are listed in Azure’s sales catalog, with commissions being paid to Microsoft’s global salesforce for successful closes. In the quarter, the company inked 28 joint deals with Microsoft, emphasizing manufacturing and chemicals.To support this channel-centric push, C3.ai has invested heavily in demo licenses and enablement tools. These demo licenses — used by partners and strategic customers alike — made up nearly 30% of the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues.C3.ai is now jointly targeting over 600 accounts with Microsoft alone, and is pursuing similar scaling with AWS, Google Cloud and newly formed alliances like PwC and McKinsey QuantumBlack. The management is optimistic and anticipates the consulting partners to unlock new levels of scalability and market penetration in the upcoming periods..Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR continues to pursue a more vertically integrated model, emphasizing direct engagement with clients over an external partner-led sales approach. Palantir does collaborate with key institutions, such as R1 RCM in healthcare automation and NATO for mission-critical AI deployments. Its Maven Smart System and AIP platform are deployed directly with defense agencies and commercial clients through proprietary programs. Palantir’s partnerships are strategic in nature but limited in scale compared to the broad commercial enablement seen at C3.ai.Snowflake Inc. SNOW, in contrast, is building a hybrid model that blends direct go-to-market with strong platform partnerships. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake highlighted expanded collaboration with Microsoft, enabling customers to host OpenAI models via Azure and integrate Snowflake’s Cortex AI products into Office Copilot. The company leverages technology from its Datavolo acquisition to improve data connectivity with partners like Google Drive, Workday, Slack and SharePoint.In the public sector, Snowflake launched Snowflake Public Sector Inc. and secured Department of Defense provisional authorization, boosting offerings to the government and national security. Its model emphasizes data ecosystem interoperability, supporting structured and unstructured data across platforms and creating opportunities for seamless collaboration. While not as externally distributed as C3.ai’s, Snowflake’s partner strategy is essential for expanding AI use cases and integrations across verticals.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c3-ai-ramps-partner-led-131300848.html,"```json

176,2025-06-23 21:00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is a Trending Stock,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Microsoft (MSFT). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +6.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.35 per share, indicating a change of +13.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $13.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.97 indicates a change of +12% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-microsoft-corporation-130003128.html,"```json

Officials cited no credible threats at this time but highlighted the need for vigilance..The Department of Homeland Security said the Israel-Iran war has placed the US in a “heightened threat environment” through Sept. 22.

Its corporate clients provide reliable revenue and high customer retention.  There are few companies as renowned as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).,"Microsoft has one of the most diversified businesses in all of the tech world..Its corporate clients provide reliable revenue and high customer retention..The company has navigated some of the country's toughest economic times..10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›.There are few companies as renowned as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That's what helped it achieve a market cap of over $3.5 trillion and sit as the world's most valuable public company (as of June 19)..Despite Microsoft's decades of success, the future remains bright, and there is still plenty of room for growth. If you're considering buying Microsoft shares, here are 10 reasons to do so -- and never sell..Microsoft has its hands in seemingly every corner of the tech world. From productivity software to cloud computing to hardware to social media to gaming, Microsoft has no shortage of revenue streams. This helps ensure Microsoft doesn't rely too heavily on one segment and helps it weather market cycles that affect specific businesses or industries..In the third quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended March 31), Microsoft made around $70 billion in revenue and had a net income of $25.8 billion. Considering Microsoft's size, the growth of both of these over the past decade has been impressive..Having a large corporate client base helps provide reliable and recurring revenue because they often have longer-term contracts. In many cases, it's not easy for corporations to switch from Microsoft because they rely too much on it for their daily operations. This helps with Microsoft's customer retention..Microsoft might not get the dividend stock label, but it has been paying one for 22 years. And even better: It has increased the annual payout for 20 consecutive years. If you're holding this stock forever, you can bet on this trend continuing. I fully expect Microsoft to eventually become a Dividend King..Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI that makes its cloud platform, Azure, the exclusive cloud provider for its artificial intelligence (AI) models. In return, Microsoft gets special access to OpenAI's AI technology, allowing it to integrate it into its large suite of products..Microsoft Azure is the world's second-largest cloud service platform, trailing Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of the end of 2024, Azure's market share was 21%. Although this is a ways behind AWS (30%), it's good progress from just a few years ago. In the past quarter, Microsoft's ""Azure and other cloud services"" revenue grew 33% year over year, making it the company's fastest-growing segment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-reasons-buy-hold-tech-114500969.html,"```json

Other investors in the business include Amadeus Capital Partners and UK-listed fund Seraphim Space..Details of Nu Quantum’s funding came as the Government pledged to invest £670m in quantum computing as part of Sir Keir Starmer’s industrial strategy..On Monday, Peter Kyle, the Technology Secretary, said the Government had agreed to provide a 10-year funding settlement to the National Quantum Computing Centre in Oxford, with the aim of developing quantum supercomputers that can outperform the most advanced, classical machines within a decade..Nu Quantum has gained momentum in recent years by developing what it calls a Quantum Networking Unit, which can be deployed to data centres. The start-up said this technology could move quantum from “lab demonstrations to commercial infrastructure”..Earlier this month, Ms Palacios-Berraquero said: “We’re moving quantum networking from academic research to practical, data centre-ready deployment..“Our focus now is on working closely with partners and customers to build scalable, modular quantum systems that deliver real commercial value.”.National Grid’s planned investment comes amid growing optimism about quantum computing technology, which could have profound implications for scientific research, climate modelling and mathematics..Breakthroughs in the technology are also of interest to the national security community, with quantum machines potentially so powerful that current encryption technology could be made obsolete..This month, Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive, said he believed quantum was reaching an “inflection point”.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-grid-hand-quantum-computing-110924516.html,"```json

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Palantir Technologies PLTR, Newmont NEM, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and AngloGold Ashanti PLC AU..The first half of 2025 has been defined by heightened volatility and uncertainty, largely stemming from the new administration’s trade policies. After hitting a low in early April, Wall Street staged a strong rebound fueled by renewed optimism over trade negotiations, solid corporate earnings, easing inflation and continued momentum in artificial intelligence..Technology stocks led the charge, with the Magnificent Seven making a powerful comeback after months of turbulence..As the half-year mark approaches, the S&P 500 is now less than 3% below its record high, while the Nasdaq Composite is 3.4% off its all-time peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, remains only marginally positive for the year. Volatility is expected to persist in the second half..Let’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:.On April 2, Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs dubbed “Liberation Day” tariffs. These included a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imports, with a few exceptions such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber. On top of the baseline, Trump introduced “reciprocal” tariffs that targeted specific countries. China faced tariffs ranging from 34% to 54%, the European Union 20%, Japan 24% and Vietnam up to 46%. These tariffs officially took effect on April 9..Facing backlash and international criticism, the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for over 75 countries on May 12, though the 10% baseline tariff remained in place. Additionally, Chinese tariffs were reduced from a peak of 145% to around 30%, though they remained substantially elevated. On May 30, Trump doubled tariffs on imported steel, raising them from 25% to 50%, citing national security concerns and the need to protect U.S. industry..These actions faced legal scrutiny. On May 28, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that many of the tariffs were illegal under international trade law. However, the court also issued a stay, meaning the tariffs would remain in place pending appeals.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-palantir-094400708.html,"```json

Even with an occasional underperforming year sprinkled in here and there, the Oracle of Omaha has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,884,143%, as of the closing bell on June 18. For the sake of comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed by around 40,000%, including dividends, since the mid-1960s..Such an overwhelming outperformance of Wall Street's encompassing stock index has professional and everyday investors riding Buffett's coattails to long-term gains. This can be done by tracking Berkshire Hathaway's trading activity via quarterly filed Form 13Fs and mirroring it..Buffett's investment success isn't based on luck, and a nearly 5,884,143% cumulative return doesn't happen by accident. It's the result of Berkshire's CEO sticking to a set of unwritten rules that guide his investment philosophy. While some of these ""rules"" have proved fungible, on rare occasion, throughout the years, there's one investing rule the Oracle of Omaha refuses to bend -- and it fully explains why he's been a net seller of stocks since October 2022..One of the most tried-and-true investment philosophies Warren Buffett lives by is the idea of long-term investing. Instead of trying to guess when short-lived stock market corrections, bear markets, or economic recessions will take place, he purchases businesses or makes acquisitions that can take advantage of long-winded periods of growth. Some of Buffett's top-performing investments, in terms of unrealized gains, have been held for multiple decades, such as Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody's..But even Berkshire's billionaire CEO has been tempted by a short-term trade before. During Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual meeting, Buffett told attendees that his company's stake in gaming colossus Activision Blizzard, which was subsequently acquired by Microsoft for $95 per share in cash, was for arbitrage purposes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-investing-rule-warren-buffett-070600016.html,"```json

The worst part is, they don't even know they are blind..Do you remember the scandal when an engineer from Google claimed that the company's AI is sentient? When I saw the headlines, I didn't even open the articles, but my conclusion was that either Google made a terrible mistake in hiring him or it was an elaborate PR stunt. I thought Google was famous for having a high hiring bar, so I was leaning toward a PR stunt—I was wrong..Related: Apple WWDC underwhelms fans in a crucial upgrade.What is amazing about that story is that roughly six months later, ChatGPT came out and put Google's AI department into panic mode.

What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html,"```json

The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html,"```json

The recent college graduate – an employee in the IT industry – is at a mandatory team dinner..“I end up working late almost every day,” laughs Lee. “By the end of the day, I feel completely drained, like I’ve used up all my energy [and] I can’t really do anything on weekdays after work.”.She begins the workday at 9.30am and ends most days at 10pm, sometimes pushing to midnight. On a single workday, Lee receives about 200 messages. With constant meetings and collaborative work filling the day, evenings are often the only time Lee has to catch up on individual tasks..This is far from unusual, according to new research. Microsoft’s 2025 work trend index report found that many workers are increasingly grappling with “infinite workdays”, which start before sunrise and stretch late into the night. They are interrupted by some 270 pinging notifications along the way, about one every two minutes..Related: Working from home?

He expected Apple to hit the mark first, followed by Nvidia, and then Microsoft. But I think he got the order reversed: Microsoft will reach a $4 trillion valuation first..Both Nvidia and Microsoft currently have market caps around $3.5 trillion, while Apple has seen its stock fall to about $3 trillion in market cap. The leading tech giants have received a clear boost from artificial intelligence (AI) spending, but Apple has struggled to make headway in advanced AI capabilities..As a result, it looks like either Nvidia or Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion valuation threshold first. And despite strong operating results from Nvidia, Microsoft looks to have the edge..Nvidia's strong results over the last few years were driven by unprecedented growth in its data center business. For the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year..The hyperscale customers like Microsoft are buying Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can produce them. In fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year..However, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including Microsoft. If those customers pull back on AI spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth..It faces plenty of challenges from other GPU makers and custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. Several of them are working to build chips for both training and inference that offer better price performance than Nvidia's all-in-one solution..So, while the GPU maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. The stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. That's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as Nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in AI, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-vs-microsoft-stock-reach-075700927.html,"```json

As an example, Archer Aviation recently adopted Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) products to improve its aircraft manufacturing capabilities, and the companies will collaborate to design critical aviation systems in the future..Forrester Research recognized Palantir as a leader in AI and machine learning platforms last August, awarding its AIP product higher scores than similar tools from Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and Databricks, a private company currently valued at $75 billion. The report highlighted differentiated software architecture as a key strength.

Revenue increased 39% to $884 million, marking the seventh consecutive acceleration (as shown in the chart below), due to particularly strong growth in the U.S. commercial and government segments. And non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased 70% to $334 million. Management attributed the strong results to the demand for AIP..Importantly, Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar told analysts on the first-quarter earnings call, ""Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and in the years ahead.""

The company has raised billions in funding from Microsoft, works closely with leading AI-focused cloud providers such as CoreWeave, and is among the key players pushing a $500 billion domestic AI infrastructure initiative called Project Stargate..Recently, OpenAI found itself in the headlines yet again following news of a major partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)..Let's explore how OpenAI and Alphabet are teaming up, and assess why this deal could be a game changer..Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital. As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure..While Azure's infrastructure has been key to OpenAI maintaining explosive growth over the last two years, recent moves from the ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft..For instance, as part of Project Stargate, Oracle is reportedly exploring purchasing several billion dollars worth of Nvidia's newest Blackwell GPU architecture and leasing access to these chips to OpenAI..According to recent reporting, OpenAI's partnership with Alphabet revolves around the same use case as the Oracle deal: accessing compute power through the Google Cloud Platform. As data workloads continue to rise, training and inferencing AI models becomes increasingly sophisticated and costly. Hence, broadening its cloud compute infrastructure beyond Azure is critical for OpenAI..While cloud computing has emerged as a fast-growing business for Alphabet, Google Cloud operates at a much smaller scale than Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). That said, working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business and AI efforts..However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-deal-alphabet-game-changer-220500302.html,"```json

196,2025-06-22 04:16:00,European leaders worry they’re too reliant on U.S. tech,"European governments may be reconsidering their use of American technology and services, according to a new report in The New York Times.","European governments may be reconsidering their use of American technology and services, according to a new report in The New York Times..The flashpoint seemed to come after President Donald Trump sanctioned Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, over the ICC’s decision to issue arrest warrants for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant..In response, Microsoft turned off Khan’s email address. Casper Klynge, a former diplomat who has also worked for Microsoft, told the NYT that Microsoft’s action became “the smoking gun that many Europeans had been looking for,” pushing them to look at alternative options. (Some ICC workers have reportedly switched over to Swiss email service Proton, for example.).“If the U.S. administration goes after certain organizations, countries or individuals, the fear is American companies are obligated to comply,” Klynge said..For its part, Microsoft said it has subsequently made policy changes to protect customers in similar situations, and it noted that it did not shut down the email accounts of four ICC judges who Trump sanctioned earlier this month. In addition, just this week, CEO Satya Nadella announced new “sovereign solutions” to protect European institutions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-leaders-worry-too-reliant-201609334.html,"```json

From expediting the licensing process for nuclear reactors to examining the potential for nuclear fuel recycling, Trump addressed a range of issues that had hindered the industry's growth for years..With enthusiasm for the nuclear energy industry surging through Washington, many are eager to find stocks that can benefit from the industry's apparent renaissance. For these investors, NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR), Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG), and Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) look like smart choices to power their portfolios..Long gone are the days of massive nuclear power plants that require enormous capital investments and take years to construct. Nowadays, companies like NuScale Power are developing small modular reactors (SMRs) that offer a variety of advantages over conventional nuclear power plants..For one, SMRs require considerably smaller footprints, making them more attractive to project developers, which can scale these reactors to their individual site's needs. And SMRs have improved safety profiles including the ability to shut down and self-cool indefinitely, unlike traditional nuclear power plants. Among other advantages, NuScale's SMRs are built in a factory, which helps to keep costs down and expedite project development..With $491 million in cash and no debt, the company is on strong financial footing, an appealing situation for those looking to balance a quality growth stock that's not rife with risk. To state its competitive advantage over other SMR providers, NuScale Power says that it's the only near-term deployable SMR company with design approval from the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission..While Constellation Energy's portfolio includes about 10 gigawatts (GWs) of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets, it's nuclear energy that represents the lion's share of its generating capacity -- about 21 GWs, or enough power to meet the demands of 16 million homes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-profit-upcoming-nuclear-163300649.html,"```json
