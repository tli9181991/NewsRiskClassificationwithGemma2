3,2025-06-25 22:30:00,Is Supply Chain Modernization Enough to Lift Home Depot's Growth?,"HD's supply-chain investments and vendor partnerships aim to boost speed, efficiency and resilience.","Supply-chain management plays a pivotal role in supporting The Home Depot, Inc.’s HD overall growth. The company has significantly invested in modernizing its supply chain to drive efficiency, speed and operational resilience. In the recent past, it has collaborated closely with its vendor partners to diversify its global supply-chain network.As part of its supply-chain diversification efforts, Home Depot is reducing its reliance on non-U.S. markets for sourcing products. This is expected to be crucial for the company in navigating a complex and evolving trade landscape marked by rising tariffs on imported goods, especially from China. Though more than 50% of HD’s products are sourced from within the United States, about half still face varying tariffs, estimated between 10% and 30%. The company is proactively addressing this by diversifying its sourcing base, with a target to ensure that no single non-U.S. country accounts for more than 10% of total purchases within 12 months.Despite this flexibility, management acknowledged that absorbing tariff-related costs without passing them to consumers may compress margins. Home Depot plans to use multiple levers, such as portfolio optimization, vendor partnerships and supply-chain efficiencies, to maintain pricing discipline.HD’s supply-chain management is further amplified by the buildout of its One Supply Chain network, focused on strengthening distribution centers, market delivery operations and same-day delivery capabilities.Home Depot is also strengthening its in-store and digital experiences, fulfillment and delivery improvements, interconnected retail strategy expansion and Pro ecosystem enhancements to reignite growth. Its strategic investments in downstream supply chain infrastructure have enhanced product availability at Distribution Fulfillment Centers, enabling quick deliveries. The company’s leveraged store network further offers flexible delivery options, enabling faster fulfillment and driving customer engagement.In first-quarter fiscal 2025, supply-chain productivity has helped offset the gross margin decline. While macroeconomic uncertainties persist, Home Depot is making steady progress on its ""One Home Depot"" investment plan, aimed at supply-chain expansion, technology integration and digital enhancement. Such moves offer the company a competitive edge and position it for long-term success..Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN are the key companies competing with Home Depot in boosting their supply-chain activities.Lowe's has been steadily advancing supply-chain transformation efforts, focused on building efficiency, optimizing inventory flow and offering a superior, reliable customer experience. The company aims to build a robust omnichannel supply chain that ensures product availability in the right quantities, at the right time and in the right locations. This strategy includes enhancing network capacity, improving flow management and driving overall operational efficiency through end-to-end optimization. Lowe’s supply chain serves as a crucial aspect of its Total Home strategy, and hence, it makes constant investments in modernizing its network to boost omnichannel capabilities. It also focuses on enhancing the speed of its delivery capabilities to better cater to the customers’ needs.Amazon, with aggressive supply-chain upgradation efforts aimed at driving speed, efficiency and scalability to ramp up its e-commerce capabilities, leads the way. The company’s supply-chain efforts include regionalization of the fulfillment network, robotics, automation, innovations and technology integration. Amazon heavily focuses on strengthening its same-day and next-day delivery capabilities, thus elevating the overall shoppers’ experience. Amazon’s supply-chain modernization drives faster and reliable delivery, operational efficiency, lower costs and enhanced customer satisfaction. Continued investment in supply-chain innovation is pivotal to Amazon’s success, with quick delivery options and services and adaptability to meet customers’ evolving needs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/supply-chain-modernization-enough-lift-143000936.html,"```json

However, the exact price or timing of Home Depot’s bid could not be determined, the WSJ noted. Home Depot also declined to comment on the rumors..The report came one day after serial dealmaker Brad Jacobs’ QXO announced it had submitted its own unsolicited proposal to purchase GMS for roughly $5 billion, or $95.20 a share in cash..Georgia-based GMS, which supplies tools and building materials for consumers and contractors, confirmed that it had received QXO’s offer and would review it..GMS has been at the center of recent speculation over a potential takeover, as firms look to take advantage of a recent need for more housing in spite of tariff-related economic uncertainty. Last year, Home Depot notched a deal to snap up SRS Distribution, a seller of professional roofing goods, for $18.25 billion, including debt, betting on increased spending by contractors and construction businesses..Shares in GMS, which had already spiked in recent weeks, soared by more than 30% over the five trading days ending on Tuesday, when the stock price finished at $99.69. Its market capitalization now stands at nearly $3.8 billion..Lowering their rating of GMS to ""market perform"" from ""outperform,"" the strategists said that, with the firm’s shares now trading at a level higher than QXO’s offer price, there is ""limited incentive for another buyer to put forth a bid well above"" where the stock currently stands..They added that, given ""the unlikelihood of QXO to raise its offer even in the event of an over-the-top bid, we now view the risk/reward as more balanced."".""While there are other potential buyers who could have interest in GMS, we view buyer involvement outside of QXO [or] Home Depot to be unlikely,"" the analysts wrote..Related articles.Raymond James downgrades GMS Inc. stock amid possible takeover speculation.Coinbase target raised to ’Street High’ at Bernstein, calling it ’misunderstood’.Loop Capital lifts Nvidia target to street high of $250 on AI chip spending",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-downgrades-gms-inc-113137412.html,"```json

The company’s top line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. A strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial.Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence, growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are key positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus.The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to increase 8.5% from 2024. However, Amazon announced mixed guidance for the second quarter. High tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods imported from China have cast uncertainty on retailers such as Amazon.

The company’s performance is supported by strong execution across key growth initiatives. Home Depot continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings.These factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects.However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates.

Its Splunk acquisition enhances the recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio.However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition.

This microcap company with a market capitalization of $193.97 million is facing challenges which include persistent margin pressure, declining orders and execution risk tied to unproven strategies. Despite this, shares trade at deep discounts, suggesting an upside if execution improves.Nevertheless, United Homes is executing a strategic transformation focused on margin expansion and operational efficiency. A shift toward refreshed home designs, now yielding 24% gross margins, supports profitability and reduces reliance on discounting. UHG’s pre-sale strategy improves margin visibility and working capital efficiency while rebidding efforts and faster build cycles enhances cost control.Though volume and margin remain under pressure amid soft demand, UHG is expanding into high-growth Southeastern markets, with a land-light model supporting disciplined capital returns.

Valuation remains attractive at 0.62X EV/S and 6.88X EV/EBITDA versus peers.Nevertheless, Eastern Company’s performance is driven by Velvac’s market share gains and operational enhancements in the Class 8 truck segment, including vertical integration and aftermarket expansion. Despite industry softness, Eastern sustains profitability, posting Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and net income of $2 million, with a gross margin of 22.4%.A leaner balance sheet and improved working capital reinforce financial flexibility.

The dividend yields 2.6% at the current price. Let's see how much you'd have to buy to get $500 in annual dividends..Home Depot stock is down 10% this year as the company faces economic pressure. Although it's the largest home improvement company in the world and demonstrates resilience, it's operating in a difficult real estate market. Home prices are still rising, mortgage rates are high, and homes sold are declining. That trickles down to all sorts of companies associated with real estate, including Home Depot..Although sales increased 9.4% year over year in the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended May 4), comparable sales were down a drop, implying that growth is only coming from opening new stores. Earnings per share also dropped in the quarter, from $3.63 last year to $3.45 this year..Investors who buy today are betting on a resurgence in real estate and a rebound for Home Depot, which is the likely scenario; however, it's unclear when that could happen..Current investors are also benefiting from the reliable passive income. Home Depot has raised the dividend annually for the past 15 years, and it has increased by 290% over the last 10 years..To make $500 in annual dividends from Home Depot stock at today's price, you'd need to own 218 shares, which would cost you $76,300. If you have that much to invest as part of a well-diversified portfolio, Home Depot could be an excellent value stock to buy. However, investors should ensure that they have a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks for optimal passive income..Before you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Home Depot wasn’t one of them.

9,2025-06-24 04:56:00,"Top Stock Reports for Amazon.com, Home Depot & Cisco Systems","AMZN gains 12.7% as AWS growth, Prime momentum, and GenAI focus offset mixed Q2 outlook and tariff risks.","Monday, June 23, 2025The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), as well as two micro-cap stocks United Homes Group, Inc. (UHG) and The Eastern Company (EML). The Zacks microcap research is unique, as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Ahead of Wall StreetThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.You can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-Markets Look Toward Sunny ClimesToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Amazon.com have gained +12.7% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s gain of +18.2%. The company’s top line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. A strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence, growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are key positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus. The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to increase 8.5% from 2024. However, Amazon announced mixed guidance for the second quarter. High tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods imported from China have cast uncertainty on retailers such as Amazon. AMZN's free cash flow has decreased significantly.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Home Depot’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (+2.2% vs. -2.5%). The company’s performance is supported by strong execution across key growth initiatives. Home Depot continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings. These factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects. However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates. Margin pressure, currency headwinds, and macroeconomic uncertainty also remain key risks. HD is also navigating a complex global trade environment, with rising tariffs.(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)Shares of Cisco Systems have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+44.7% vs. +43.5%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in recurring revenue bases bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances the recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio. However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.(You can read the full research report on Cisco Systems here >>>)United Homes’ shares have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (-37.4% vs. -5.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $193.97 million is facing challenges which include persistent margin pressure, declining orders and execution risk tied to unproven strategies. Despite this, shares trade at deep discounts, suggesting an upside if execution improves.Nevertheless, United Homes is executing a strategic transformation focused on margin expansion and operational efficiency. A shift toward refreshed home designs, now yielding 24% gross margins, supports profitability and reduces reliance on discounting. UHG’s pre-sale strategy improves margin visibility and working capital efficiency while rebidding efforts and faster build cycles enhances cost control. Though volume and margin remain under pressure amid soft demand, UHG is expanding into high-growth Southeastern markets, with a land-light model supporting disciplined capital returns. The recent debt refinancing improves liquidity and reduces dilution risk.(You can read the full research report on United Homes here >>>)Shares of Eastern have underperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the past year (-1.3% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $142.05 million has risks like elevated SG&A amid restructuring, cyclical reliance on Class 8 OEMs, weak R&D investment, and recent negative cash flow due to working capital drag. Valuation remains attractive at 0.62X EV/S and 6.88X EV/EBITDA versus peers. Nevertheless, Eastern Company’s performance is driven by Velvac’s market share gains and operational enhancements in the Class 8 truck segment, including vertical integration and aftermarket expansion. Despite industry softness, Eastern sustains profitability, posting Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and net income of $2 million, with a gross margin of 22.4%. A leaner balance sheet and improved working capital reinforce financial flexibility. Strategic manufacturing footprints across the United States, Mexico, and China support tariff agility and local sourcing trends. Capital returns remain robust with a long-standing dividend and a new buyback program.(You can read the full research report on Eastern here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shell plc (SHEL), Quanta Services, Inc.

Late Wednesday, QXO (NYSE: QXO) proposed acquiring the business for about $5 billion, or $95.20 per share in cash, a premium of 27% to GMS's 60-day volume-weighted average..QXO is a roll-up put together by Brad Jacobs, the M&A specialist behind companies including XPO and United Rentals. The company did its first deal in April, acquiring Beacon Roofing Supply for $11 billion, and continues to seek out acquisition opportunities toward its goal to build a $50 billion business in the years to come..GMS said its board would review the proposal. QXO set a deadline of June 24 for a response, saying it intends to go directly to GMS shareholders if a deal can't be worked out..But QXO might have competition for the business. Late Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has also made an offer for GMS. So far, Home Depot has not gone public with a bid, and it is unclear what price it is offering for GMS..Though nothing is certain, with two deep-pocketed suitors, it appears likely that GMS's time as an independent company is nearing an end. And it is possible that, since there are two bidders, the sale will be for a higher price than the $95.20-per-share QXO offer..The market is already pricing that in, bidding GMS shares as high as $104 on Friday morning..Though both Home Depot and QXO have the resources to engage in a bidding war, both have smart management teams and solid strategies and seem unlikely to dramatically overpay. It is also unclear whether Home Depot was simply being opportunistic, or if the company considers GMS to be strategic enough to engage in a battle..Given the uncertainty of the outcome and the considerable premium already priced into GMS shares, investors should tread carefully..Before you buy stock in Gms, consider this:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gms-stock-soaring-today-192421976.html,"```json

Although this announcement lifted GMS shares significantly, Home Depot's stock experienced a 1% decline over the last quarter. This period also saw the appointment of Angie Brown as EVP and CIO, maintaining continuity in leadership, and a robust earnings report with increased sales but slightly decreased net income. Amid a generally flat market with geopolitical concerns affecting sentiment, these developments likely added weight to the overall stability in the company’s share price..Home Depot has 2 warning signs we think you should know about..Diversify your portfolio with solid dividend payers offering reliable income streams to weather potential market turbulence..The potential acquisition of GMS Inc. by Home Depot may impact the company's growth narrative by enhancing its Pro ecosystem and expanding its market reach. This move could strengthen Home Depot's sales integration efforts and improve revenue growth through investments in new store locations and delivery capabilities. However, the 1% decline in Home Depot's stock over the past quarter might reflect immediate market apprehensions about potential bidding competition and its implications on earnings and capital allocation..Looking at a longer-term horizon, Home Depot's total shareholder return was 62.41% over the past five years, emphasizing consistent growth beyond short-term market fluctuations. While this performance is noteworthy, the company underperformed the US market, which returned 10.4% over the past year. Similarly, within its industry, Home Depot lagged, as the US Specialty Retail sector saw a 3.3% increase over the same period..Anticipated changes resulting from the GMS Inc. acquisition could significantly affect Home Depot's revenue and earnings forecasts. Analysts expect revenue to grow at 3.7% annually over the next three years, although uncertainties regarding big-ticket projects due to higher interest rates may pose challenges. The recent share price movement, with Home Depot trading at US$359.38, places it below the consensus analyst price target of US$423.65, indicating a 15.2% potential upside. This suggests investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects despite short-term fluctuations..Upon reviewing our latest valuation report, Home Depot's share price might be too optimistic..

The ante was raised after the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) has submitted its own offer for GMS, although the price Home Depot is willing to pay could not be learned..GMS, for its part, said it would review the QXO offer, which it described as “unsolicited.” GMS has not commented on the potential Home Depot offer but said it is working with investment bank Jefferies LLC..Despite the QXO bid being viewed as unsolicited, Jacobs disclosed in a letter that he met with GMS CEO John Turner in May of this year and that his company has been “studying GMS for over a year.”.QXO is just coming off the closing of its $11 billion deal for  Beacon Roofing  Supply (NASDAQ:BECN), which analysts have described as its “cornerstone acquisition.”.The Beacon deal is seen as part of the reason GMS is now “in play.” The other reason is that home building is expected to be a stable and growing industry in the U.S., and the industry is relatively AI-proof..In the letter, Jacobs noted that GMS has seen a “meaningful changes in the volume and trading levels of GMS shares since our announcement to acquire Beacon Roofing Supply.” In addition, analysts have noted that GMS was a potential takeover target. “With respect to the takeover speculation in the stock, we also note the steep rise in your share price following our meeting on May 22, 2025, in New York, as well as a research report by Raymond James, which resulted from a non-deal roadshow with you and your CFO, stating that GMS was a likely acquisition target and GMS’s management was willing to entertain a sale,” Jacobs said in the letter. He also commented on rumors from industry participants that bankers had been “aggressively marketing the Company for sale.”.If a bidding war between QXO and Home Depot does ensue, Wall Street analysts expect Home Depot to come out on top..“QXO has a history of ""one and done"" offers for companies while HD, in our view, may be willing to pay a higher multiple,” Truist Securities analyst Keith Hughes said on Friday while raising his price target to $105 per share.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qxo-won-t-participate-bidding-164725070.html,"```json

22,2025-06-20 22:38:00,Is Recovery in Big-Ticket Demand the Key to HD's Next Growth Leg?,"HD eyes big-ticket remodel demand as its next growth lever, but high rates and cautious consumers stand in the way.","Although The Home Depot Inc. HD has seen continued strength in its smaller-scale DIY and maintenance projects like appliances, building materials and lumber, the missing catalyst for sustained top-line acceleration lies in the revival of big-ticket remodel and renovation spend. Home Depot continues to see soft engagement for big-ticket discretionary categories (those exceeding $1,000 in ticket value), such as kitchen and bath remodels, as higher interest rates discouraged financing-dependent projects. A revival in these big-ticket home improvement projects is widely seen as the next inflection point for Home Depot’s growth.Big-ticket sales, often a barometer of remodeling demand, grew just 0.3% in first-quarter fiscal 2025. Backed by this slowdown, the company’s overall comparable sales (comps) declined 0.3%, with U.S. comps up just 0.2%. Given that big-ticket categories like kitchen, bath and major exterior remodels can represent 10-15% of total ticket sales, even a modest rebound can translate into hundreds of millions in incremental revenues.With no major improvement expected in interest rates or housing turnover in 2025, the company anticipates continued pressure on big-ticket renovations, such as kitchen and bath remodels. While Pro sales have been strong, the shift in consumer spending toward smaller-scale repairs and maintenance projects suggests that larger project demand may not rebound meaningfully in the near term, limiting growth potential in high-margin categories.However, Home Depot has been hard at work, positioning itself to capture this spending surge. Through its SRS acquisition and trade-credit rollout, the company offers financing options to thousands of pros, while streamlined digital and in-store lending tools make qualifying for consumer project loans easier. With in-stock rates for building materials and fixtures at record highs, Home Depot is ensuring that when rates soften, it can fulfill large orders without delay.Ultimately, the degree to which big-ticket demand recovers will set the pace for Home Depot’s next growth leg. Investors should monitor interest-rate trends, especially any drop below the current 7% mortgage norms, and early signs of increased financed project activity. Sustained acceleration in large-scale remodels can unlock a significant multiplier effect, driving both comp transactions and average ticket size well above the recent levels..D's primary competitors, Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW and Walmart Inc. WMT, are also grappling with headwinds from muted demand in big-ticket categories. Like Home Depot, both retailers are seeing cautious consumer behavior, particularly in discretionary, high-value purchases such as appliances and home upgrades.Lowe’s big-ticket sales, those above $500, also remained soft in first-quarter fiscal 2025, particularly in appliances and outdoor living, reflecting continued consumer caution on large discretionary purchases. These high-value transactions are significant drivers of Lowe’s overall revenues, especially in project-based categories like kitchens, flooring and bathroom remodels. Like Home Depot, Lowe’s big-ticket business is closely tied to broader housing trends and interest rate movements. Both retailers rely on a mix of DIY and Pro customers, and are positioned to benefit from a rebound in financed renovation activity. A recovery in big-ticket demand would be a critical tailwind for Lowe’s, potentially reigniting comps and supporting its Total Home strategy.Walmart’s big-ticket discretionary sales have been soft, particularly in electronics, appliances and home goods, as inflation-sensitive consumers prioritize essentials over discretionary spending. Unlike Home Depot, Walmart’s overall business is less dependent on big-ticket items, with a larger portion of its revenues driven by groceries and everyday essentials. However, both companies face similar challenges in the big-ticket space, including cautious consumer sentiment and deferred purchases due to high interest rates. Walmart has responded by sharpening price points and emphasizing value, a strategy that mirrors Home Depot’s efforts to maintain competitiveness in large-scale project categories. While big-ticket items make up a smaller share of Walmart’s total sales, a rebound in this segment can still provide meaningful upside, particularly for its general merchandise division.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recovery-big-ticket-demand-key-143800434.html,"```json

GMS now has a market capitalization of $3.1 billion..On Wednesday, dealmaker Brad Jacobs’ QXO (NYSE:QXO) announced it had submitted its own unsolicited proposal to purchase GMS for roughly $5 billion, or $95.20 a share in cash.

If you're looking for a great value stock, Home Depot stock looks priced to buy today..The market is hovering just north of flat for the year, and there's a tentative confidence in the economy. Many tariff issues have been worked out for now, and U.S. companies are demonstrating resilience. However, it's fragile. With interest rates still high and the real estate market still low, many companies, specifically related to the housing market, are still under pressure..Home Depot has been reporting moderate performance, and it's not expecting that to let up as long as conditions remain the way they are right now. Home Depot stock is 18% off its all-time high, and investors should take a look..Mortgage rates are still high, and the real estate market is still stagnating. According to Redfin data, housing prices rose in May, while house sales tumbled 6% from last year. The national average 30-year fixed mortage rate was 6.8%, slightly lower from last year, but still elevated..This is mostly detrimental to Home Depot's business, because people invest in renovating new homes, whether big projects or small. They try to avoid investing in old homes that they plan to leave. The flip side, though, is that if they remain in their older homes, they have no choice but to fix them up to make them livable or comfortable. That provides a natural hedge against negative market forces. That was borne out in recent results, which demonstrate that customers are shopping for small projects while putting big remodeling jobs on hold..Home Depot is the largest home improvement retail chain in the world, and it has a robust omnichannel network serving individuals and pros. The vast and varied business means that it has many levers to pull to generate engagement and sales..Under any circumstances, Home Depot operates in a great industry because there's always a need for it. Management pointed out that the housing stock is aging, with 55% of U.S. homes at least 40 years old. They're most homeowners' largest asset, and these houses need work..In the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended May 4), sales were up 9.4%, but comparable sales (comps) were roughly flat year over year. Earnings per share (EPS) declined from $3.63 last year to $3.45 this year, and the results were in line with expectations.

HD and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. LOW. These industry heavyweights have long been locked in a competitive duel, each carving out a formidable presence in a sector that thrives on consumer demand for housing upgrades, DIY trends and professional construction projects. While both operate within the same core business — selling tools, appliances, building materials and services — their strategic playbooks, market positioning and financial trajectories reveal key differences. Home Depot continues to lead in market share and professional customer penetration, while Lowe’s has been reshaping its model with targeted investments in digital infrastructure and store productivity. As macroeconomic conditions shift and consumer behavior evolves, this face-off explores how each retailer is positioned for sustained dominance and which is better built for long-term growth..As the largest home improvement retailer in the United States, Home Depot commands an estimated 25% share of the highly fragmented $1-trillion home improvement industry. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, the company posted $39.9 billion in sales, a 9.4% year-over-year increase, with strong performance across categories like appliances, electrical and building materials. Despite a slight comp decline of 0.3%, Home Depot’s deep market penetration and diversified customer base — from DIYers to large-scale Pros — continue to reinforce its leadership. The retailer’s portfolio, including its 2,350 stores and rapidly expanding SRS division, positions it to tap into a significant pool of deferred demand, estimated at $50 billion in home improvement spending. Home equity remains strong, as more than 55% of U.S. homes are more than 40 years old, signaling ongoing structural tailwinds. Home Depot is investing in the Pro ecosystem, enhancing order management, pricing and credit solutions. The SRS acquisition, spanning roofing, pool and landscaping, boosts organic growth while expanding reach into complex, large-ticket projects.Simultaneously, Home Depot is doubling down on digital innovation. Its “Magic Apron” generative AI tool boosts e-commerce engagement, while fast, reliable delivery and strong in-stock rates elevate customer satisfaction. Digital sales rose 8% year over year, and features like AI-powered associate tools are sharpening execution at scale. The brand’s trusted image, wide assortment and premium positioning ensure that Home Depot remains the go-to destination for home upgrades and contractor-grade solutions alike.HD is well-positioned to manage tariff headwinds, with more than 50% of sourcing in the United States and diversified supplier bases, where no single country outside the United States will account for more than 10% of purchases by fiscal 2026. The company plans to maintain stable pricing, leveraging productivity and SKU rationalization rather than passing on broad cost increases, potentially widening its advantage over smaller, less agile competitors. As market dynamics evolve, Home Depot’s scale, strategy and innovation keep it firmly anchored as a long-term investment cornerstone.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hd-vs-low-better-bet-135300095.html,"```json

However, a more focused measure, which strips out volatile categories like autos, gas, and building materials, showed a 0.4% gain. This metric is closely watched by economists because it feeds into GDP calculations..Spending peaked in March as consumers rushed to make purchases ahead of anticipated tariff enactments from President Donald Trump’s April “liberation day” announcement. But by May, shoppers grew cautious, especially with big-ticket items..Below we highlight a few areas and the related ETFs & stocks that may benefit handsomely from the retail sales..Nonstore retailers (e.g., online sales) saw a 0.9% sequential increase and 8.3% yearly gain..ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN –The ProShares Online Retail Index is a specialized retail index that tracks retailers principally selling online or through other non-store channels.

That’s been the starting point for any discussion about spring business for the home improvement retailers.”.The analysts tracked promotional events and traffic trends to assess the outlook for Q2 same-store sales (SSS)..They said Home Depot (Buy-rated) extended the duration of its spring promotions compared to last year, running events continuously in May and June..However, traffic data is reportedly still soft. “Positive trends around Easter have reversed to firmly negative foot traffic throughout May and into June,” Citi wrote..They added that web traffic has also been “consistently soft throughout the spring selling season.”.For Lowe’s (Neutral-rated), Citi notes that they launched two new longer-duration events — Member Week and Mulch Week — but eliminated others..Citi stated that “LOW foot traffic has been firmly in the negative in 2025 relative to mixed traffic trends in 2024,” while web traffic also lagged..“DIY continues to see weakness thus far in 2Q, which is more meaningful for LOW,” Citi said, adding that the sector’s second-quarter performance will likely hinge on strength from Pro sales..The firm is modeling +1.0% SSS growth for Home Depot and +1.5% for Lowe’s, largely in line with management commentary and consensus..Overall, Citi concluded that “tracking promotional events as well as web traffic and store traffic data is a better indicator for DIY business trends,” and the data so far suggests continued challenges ahead..Related articles.Will DIY stocks continue to be challenged?

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Home Depot (HD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this home-improvement retailer have returned -7.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry, which Home Depot falls in, has lost 8.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Home Depot is expected to post earnings of $4.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.04 points to a change of -1.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.41 indicates a change of +9.2% from what Home Depot is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Home Depot.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-inc-hd-attracting-130004369.html,"```json

These stores therefore focus on providing what is needed for both the upkeep of a house as well as what is desired for the aesthetics of a home. Decades ago, it was thought that furniture and home improvement would resist e-commerce because of the logistical challenges of shipping a sofa or lawn mower, but now you can buy both online; so just like other retailers, these stores need to adapt to new realities and consumer behaviors..The 7 home furnishing and improvement retail stocks we track reported a slower Q1. As a group, revenues along with next quarter’s revenue guidance were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates..While some home furnishing and improvement retail stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.2% since the latest earnings results..Founded in North Carolina as Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware, the company is a home improvement retailer that sells everything from paint to tools to building materials..Lowe's reported revenues of $20.93 billion, down 2% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts’ gross margin estimates but full-year revenue guidance meeting analysts’ expectations..""Despite near-term uncertainty and housing market headwinds, our team's unwavering focus on exceptional customer service has elevated satisfaction scores and earned Lowe's the #1 ranking in Customer Satisfaction among Home Improvement Retailers* by J.D.

WSM and The Lovesac Company LOVE have been leveraging product reinvention, efficient cost management, exclusive collaborations, and innovative marketing strategies to stand out as winners, as they capture market share while enhancing the customer experience. Despite economic headwinds and tariff concerns, the industry’s tech-driven evolution signals a favorable long-term outlook. Companies combining digital innovation with strong branding and service integration are well-positioned to outperform in the evolving retail landscape..Industry Description.The Zacks Retail-Home Furnishings industry comprises retailers offering home furnishing products under various categories. The merchandise assortment includes furniture, garden accessories, framed art, lighting, mirrors, candles, tableware, lamps, picture frames, bathware, accent rugs, artificial floral products, and child and teen furnishing. The industry players also develop, manufacture, market and distribute bedding products. The companies provide home and security products for residential home repair, remodeling, new construction and security applications. They are involved in manufacturing, assembling and selling faucets, accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposal..4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail-Home Furnishings Industry.Online Growth, Tech platforms, Digital Services & Personalization: Continuing acceleration in online furniture shopping, combined with cutting-edge solutions like room visualizers and AR, unlocks strong growth potential. Major platforms, like Wayfair, Amazon and Williams-Sonoma, are investing heavily in AI driven personalization and immersive user experiences. Features like augmented reality (AR) room visualizers, virtual reality showrooms, and mobile first shopping are reshaping the consumer journey. Companies leading innovation in these areas are well positioned to capture share as convenience and digital engagement become critical in buying decisions.Gen Z and millennials value customization. Services such as AI-driven design apps, virtual interior consulting, and bundling (such as packaged room solutions) will help the companies boost margins. For example, Lowe’s acquisition of Artison Design (a home furnishing design/install company) signals that offering full-service packages is lucrative. Furniture retailers can similarly offer in-home assembly, design subscription services, or AR “try-before-you-buy” apps to increase attachment rates and customer loyalty.Strong Product Reinvention & Marketing Moves: Product innovation plays a pivotal role in market share gain in this industry. Companies aim to come up with products and collaborate with celebrated brands and designers to maintain exclusivity. Also, customer experience is being enhanced by innovative marketing techniques, with an emphasis on digital marketing, better merchandising, store remodeling and loyalty programs. The companies are also going for strategic omnichannel expansion. Even digitally native retailers are exploring brick-and-mortar formats to enhance brand visibility and customer experience. Wayfair’s first large-format store in Illinois exemplifies this hybrid approach. Meanwhile, premium players like RH RH continue expanding showrooms that blend physical touchpoints with high-end brand storytelling.Improved Consumer Confidence, Stabilizing Mortgage Rates, Housing Market Recovery & Builder Partnerships: Though households continued to worry about tariffs raising prices and hurting the economy, U.S. consumer confidence improved in May 2025 after deteriorating for five straight months. Consumer confidence index increased 12.3 points to 98.0 in May. Consumers' assessments of current business conditions improved in May, along with consumers' outlook for their income prospects, which turned positive.Meanwhile, mortgage rates have moved within a narrow range for the past few months. Freddie Mac reports that 30 year mortgage rates have remained steady for the week that ended June 12, hovering around 6.84%, closely tracking the narrow range seen over the past few months. According to Chief Economist Sam Khater, this environment of rate stability, along with increased housing inventory and slowing house price growth, forms a promising backdrop for prospective homebuyers.Economic Uncertainties: The Federal Reserve (Fed) has lowered its U.S. economic growth forecast amid uncertainty while raising its inflation projection surrounding President Trump's tariff policies in the latest March 2025 meeting. The Fed now expects GDP growth of 1.7% in 2025, down from its previous estimate of 2.1% (predicted in December 2024), and inflation to rise to 2.7%, partly due to tariffs. Interest rates remain unchanged at 4.25%-4.5%, but policymakers signal potential rate cuts later this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted ""remarkably high"" uncertainty, while Trump urged the Fed to cut rates further. Economists warn tariffs could push prices higher, despite Trump's claims that they will benefit the U.S. economy.While mortgage rates have stabilized, affordability remains a key issue, with 30-year rates still being high at 6–7%. This continues to deter buyers despite rising inventory. Home prices remain elevated as financing costs suppress demand. Broader economic uncertainties, ranging from inflation to tariff tensions, further weigh on consumer confidence and cloud the housing market outlook.

A 4% average yield on a small investment may not earn much today, but as you keep saving and investing in top dividend stocks, you could build a portfolio that pays $20,000 in annual income on $500,000 over time..The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is a great place to look for rock-solid companies that pay high yields. Here are two Dow Jones stocks to buy today to start building your future passive income stream..Despite a weak housing market, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) stock has held up well over the past year. This speaks to its massive scale and leading position in the home improvement market..Higher interest rates continue to weigh on demand for home projects. Home Depot reported a total sales increase of 9% year over year in the first quarter, but it notched a slight decline in comparable-store sales..Regardless of how the economy performs in the near term, Home Depot offers attractive upside for long-term shareholders. It serves a large $1 trillion addressable market, and Home Depot has only captured about 17% of that opportunity. The company is particularly focused on going after business from professional contractors, which represents a $525 billion opportunity..Home Depot is also investing to diversify its supply chain from the impact of tariffs. It expects that no single country outside of the U.S. will represent more than 10% of its sourcing in the next 12 months..Once the home improvement market recovers, Home Depot can deliver double-digit annual earnings growth around 10%, which is consistent with its previous 10-year history. Home Depot paid 61% of its earnings in dividends last year, providing plenty of room to sustain the dividend despite the weak sales environment..The company has paid a dividend for 38 consecutive years, which covers quite a few bull-bear market cycles. It recently increased its quarterly dividend by 2% to $2.30, bringing its forward annual yield to 2.52%. An investor can expect to earn $126 in income over the next year from a $5,000 investment..Investors have been attracted to Verizon Communications' (NYSE: VZ) high yield of more than 6%. The yield has gotten higher as the stock slid in recent years over increasing competition in the consumer wireless market, higher interest rates, and the company's high debt burden. However, the stock bounced back in 2025, as Verizon continues to reduce its debt and generate robust cash flows to fund its dividend.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-400-passive-income-invest-080500531.html,"```json

That's where the National Guard was called in. And some companies like Home Depot are being caught in the crosshairs of President Trump's deportation efforts. For more, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman, our political commentator, um, or, I should say crossroad, crossroads of politics and economy commentator. .Sure. .Call me anything, Julie. .Okay. Um, I'll call you Rick. Um, so Rick, .you know, we have seen, um, sort of a change in tack from the administration. Sort of the first wave, focusing on immigrants who were in the US illegally who had also committed other crimes, Right. to now doing more of a broad sweep of folks. .They're going to Home Depot parking lots, right? Um, and they're, you know, this affects, as we've talked about with the economists before, certain workforces in particular. So what should we be watching? .Yeah. .I mean, that's the thing I'm thinking about is the parts of the labor force. Uh, migrant workers are a very important source, source of labor in construction. That's why this is happening at Home Depot, also in agriculture, retail, hospitality. Um, so what's happening now is Trump's immigration policy is now starting to touch the, uh, informal workforce and the informal economy, if you will. And I mean, there, there's a lot of reason to pay close attention to this because if you could just all at once take all the migrant workers out of the US economy, you would have a massive problem. I mean, this is a big source of workers. I mean, food would not get picked, um, projects would not get completed, homes would not get built. So it's starting. Um, I don't know what's going to happen, but if you look at why they're focusing on Home Depot, and of course, Home Depot, like almost any company, they want nothing to do with the controversy. They try hard, every company tries to stay as far away from this as they can, but um, a lot of contractors use Home Depot. Some of those contract workers shop at Home Depot for the stuff they need for projects. So, so the immigration authorities got the idea, let's go looking around at some Home Depots. And apparently, they are actually going into, um, some Home Depot outlets and places where they think they can, they can find some of these people. Um, there is actually a Reddit thread on, uh, you know, people who work at Home Depot saying, what do you do if you think ICE is coming into your location? This is not going to happen at every Home Depot across the country. And I think if the Trump administration were smart, maybe they would stop going into like retail establishments and find some other way to, you know, hit their numbers, but um, it's a problem. .Yeah, and it's a problem, I think, like we can think about this from a business and economic perspective on, on a number of different fronts. I mean, the Wall Street Journal had a story looking at retailers, not just like a Home Depot, but food establishments that maybe are seeing a drop in traffic because people are afraid to shop in them because they're afraid a raid is going to come in. So you have that kind of effect on publicly traded companies potentially. You have the effect on unemployment numbers, which may not be the same. You, then maybe you have an effect on wages as well as we're seeing this situation play out. So there are a lot of potential repercussions. .Right. .Right. .So, if I, I would guess that the strategy of the Trump administration, I mean, it has been reported that they want higher numbers. Um, so if you just went to farms and fields, um, where a lot of crops are picked, you would probably find tons of undocumented migrants. Do you want to do that? Um, do you want to, do you want to take everybody out of a, a field, I mean, it would be easy pickings, pardon the pun. Do you want to do that, though? .But do remember, just aren't there some actual programs where people do come in seasonally legally, right? .Yes, that's a, that's a different, yeah, that's a different thing. But we, we know that all of these things are happening. Right. Um, you could go to big construction sites and probably take half the workers off the job. Then what happens to the construction project? I mean, do you really want to do that? So I, what I detect is the Trump administration is dabbling with this idea of let's, let's interfere with business a little bit and see what happens. So if you're picking up five workers, you know, five-day laborers from a Home Depot parking lot, is that going to, um, show up in, you know, the GDP of Los Angeles? Probably not, um, but I'm trying to find contractors and I'm just starting to do a lot of this reporting, talk to them and see, is this affecting your business yet? Do you have a backup plan? Can you get workers from someplace else? This is not to defend, um, illegal immigration, but the fact is that these migrants are an important part of the labor force and you can't just take them all out of the labor force without any problems. .All right, we'll keep watching. Thank you, Rick. .Yeah. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/home-depot-got-caught-immigration-204830967.html,"```json

46,2025-06-12 21:46:00,Home Depot's Margins Hold Steady: Is Top-Line Growth Stalling?,"HD keeps margins firm in first-quarter fiscal 2025 despite rising costs, but soft comps and weak big-ticket sales hint at slowing demand and comps.","Margins are a vital indicator of operational efficiency, and for The Home Depot Inc. HD, margins are its core strength. With its scale-driven cost leverage, tight inventory controls and robust supply chain, the retailer has consistently outperformed its peers on profitability. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, Home Depot maintained a gross margin of 33.8% and an adjusted operating margin of 13.2%, despite pressures from higher SG&A and integration of SRS Distribution. The ability to manage shrink, supply-chain productivity and pricing helped partially offset margin pressures, even as the company invested heavily in Pro ecosystem capabilities and digital tools like Magic Apron. This underscores its disciplined execution.However, top-line momentum tells a more tempered story. While total sales rose 9.4% to $39.9 billion—buoyed largely by acquisitions and calendar shifts—comparable sales declined 0.3%, with U.S. comps up just 0.2%. Big-ticket sales, often a barometer of remodeling demand, grew just 0.3%, as elevated interest rates weighed on demand for larger financed projects like kitchen and bath remodels. Instead, customers gravitated toward smaller DIY tasks and seasonal purchases, highlighting the ongoing macro sensitivity to elevated interest rates and sluggish housing turnover.Home Depot’s Pro ecosystem expansion, digital tools like Magic Apron and exclusive brand deals are well-positioned to unlock future growth. However, without a rebound in large-scale renovation demand, fueled by easier credit or greater macro confidence, the company may find it challenging to convert margin resilience into sustained revenue acceleration..From a margin standpoint, Home Depot's main competitors are Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW and Walmart Inc. WMT.Home Depot typically maintains stronger net margins than Lowe’s, driven by its scale, financial strength and operational efficiency. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, Lowe’s posted a 33.4% gross margin and an 11.9% operating margin, with comparable sales down 1.7% due to weak big-ticket DIY demand and unfavorable weather. While Lowe’s saw gains in Pro and online channels and continues to expand margin and ROIC, it still trails Home Depot in Pro penetration and supply-chain execution. The key difference lies in customer mix, Home Depot’s more mature Pro ecosystem offers stability and higher margins, whereas Lowe’s heavier DIY exposure makes it more sensitive to consumer spending shifts.Walmart, though significantly larger in revenues and similarly leveraged, operates with a very different margin profile than Home Depot. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, Walmart posted a gross margin of 24.2% and an operating margin of 5.1%, with a net profit margin of 2.75%, well below Home Depot’s nearly 9%. Walmart’s scale and grocery-heavy mix offer sales stability but limit margin upside. In contrast, Home Depot’s focus on higher-margin categories like tools, appliances and Pro services supports stronger profitability. Walmart’s pricing power is more exposed to rising costs and tariffs, prompting selective price hikes, while Home Depot’s specialized model and margin flexibility help it maintain stable pricing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depots-margins-hold-steady-134600458.html,"```json

But Where?.NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire.Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico.California Pitches Emergency Loans for LA, Local Transit Systems.BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are among firms scaling up a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting, typically offered through customized portfolios called separately managed accounts. When markets drop, managers sell stocks trading below their purchase price to realize losses. Those losses offset gains elsewhere in a portfolio, reducing clients’ tax liabilities while maintaining overall portfolio exposure..The approach allows investors to shrink their current-year IRS bills while deferring capital gains into the future. In April’s selloff, for example, a manager could dump Home Depot Inc. and rotate into Lowe’s Cos Inc., maintaining sector exposure while staying inside tax rules..Once a boutique service reserved only for the ultra-rich, investment firms are repackaging market turbulence as a fiscal opportunity, with automated trading programs scanning portfolios daily as equity conditions shift. With fee pressure eroding revenue in traditional asset management, Wall Street is leaning more heavily on tax-optimization trades to differentiate offerings, retain clients and defend margins in a competitive marketplace..“There is just inherently going to be more volatility in the system,” said Scott Smith, senior director at industry consultant Cerulli Associates. “With trade policies, tariffs, taxes, everything is on the table. There is no assumption of what the future looks.”.In one particularly active stretch during April’s selloff, BlackRock’s Aperio, a platform for personalized portfolios, executed more than $18 billion in trades. That generated $700 million in realized losses that can be used to offset taxable gains elsewhere in client portfolios, or so-called tax-loss harvesting. That equated to roughly $5 to $7 in losses realized for every $100 traded that month..“We monitor daily. We look at losses and high-cash positions. We balance harvesting with managing tracking error,” said Ran Leshem, who oversees BlackRock’s separately managed account business, now managing $220 billion. “Our goal is to be the market leader in SMAs.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-goldman-scale-tax-trades-141953472.html,"```json

(NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses..A caller asked how Cramer thinks The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) would perform in the long term. He replied:.“Oh man, I was making calls on Home Depot today because it’s starting to roll, and then wouldn’t you know it, it pulled back right at the end. I think we’re in good shape. I think when rates just stay stable, we’ll be fine. I think that the gardening season’s coming along fine, but let me just say, people just look at housing starts and they say, let’s sell Home Depot. Don’t be constrained by that. I think they’re going to have a great year. Let’s think seven years, not seven days. Thank you, Larry Fink for that. I love that. It was in the FT yesterday.”.Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a retailer specializing in home improvement products, including building materials, home décor, and garden supplies. The company provides installation services for home projects and rents out tools and equipment. Earlier in May, Cramer said:.“Now, not that long ago, we dropped in on a monster Home Depot store management meeting in Vegas where we heard about some great ideas for spring gardening season, which by the way, kicks into overdrive this weekend. Unfortunately, these big weeks for lawn and garden have been overshadowed by stubbornly high interest rates and no rate cuts from the Fed, not to mention tariff worries. Now I’ve watched this stock since it came public, and there are plenty of times that Home Depot doesn’t actually march to the tune of interest rates, but instead is levered to repair and renovation..An insurance broker discussing policy options with a homeowner..As so many people are stuck in their homes, I’m willing to trade up because that would force them to give up that low mortgage rate that they may have gotten during the COVID period. Now we own the despot for the Charitable Trust, and while I’m not expecting a blowout by any means, I have to tell you I like it long term, and it’s down 2% for the year, well, off its highs… Home Depot stock is a great one to own because, like Walmart, these guys have the scale to cope with the tariffs that are going to be put on so many foreign-made goods that they sell at Home Depot. The little guys we know, they don’t have that kind of flexibility.”.Overall, HD ranks 10th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.

(LOW) on Rijnberk InvestInsights’ Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LOW. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW)'s share was trading at $225.73 as of 30th May. LOW’s trailing and forward P/E were 18.67 and 18.42 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Home improvement tools.Last week, Lowe’s Companies reported fiscal Q1 earnings that failed to excite Wall Street, causing shares to drop about 2% the following day and roughly 1% over the week. While Lowe’s reaffirmed its FY25 guidance alongside its larger rival Home Depot, the results underscored ongoing consumer spending weakness, raising concerns about a possible economic slowdown or shallow recession that could extend into 2026. Given Lowe’s heavy reliance on discretionary consumer spending, this cautious outlook weighed on investor sentiment, leaving shares nearly flat over the past year despite some earlier gains following Home Depot’s solid report..However, beneath the short-term headwinds, Lowe’s continues to make meaningful progress in strengthening its business for long-term growth. The company’s aggressive push into the professional “Pro” market, traditionally dominated by Home Depot, has yielded market share gains in a valuable segment, while investments in its technology and online platforms have driven sales growth. These strategic moves position Lowe’s to outperform the broader market over time under its current management. The home improvement sector, though cyclical and sensitive to economic shifts, benefits from secular trends such as increasing homeowner investments in renovations, driven by rising home values, personalization desires, and lifestyle changes like remote work..With over half of U.S. homes built before 1980, demand for upgrades and repairs remains strong, supporting an industry growth rate expected to reach 5.2% CAGR through 2032.

Of course, that's just an expression -- there will be a tomorrow for Floor & Decor, and I believe it will be great for shareholders.","Floor & Decor's business model earned praise from an all-time great investor, and it has large expansion plans..The stock's valuation is more attractive than usual and it's unlikely to get much cheaper tomorrow..10 stocks we like better than Floor & Decor ›.In 2017, home improvement retail chain Floor & Decor Holdings (NYSE: FND) went public. It only had about 70 locations and was still virtually unknown. And investors could have bought it at any time during the past eight years. But now it's time to buy Floor & Decor stock like there's no tomorrow..Of course, that's just an expression -- there will be a tomorrow for Floor & Decor, and I believe it will be great for shareholders. That's why I believe it's worth the investment today. But when it comes to buying the stock at an attractive price, I don't think that investors should necessarily wait until tomorrow, hoping for any entry point that's better than this..The valuation is my third reason to buy Floor & Decor stock today. But first allow me to explain two other reasons why it's a good buy right now..Before he passed away in 2023, Charlie Munger was renowned for being a great investor and one who was focused on business fundamentals. Therefore, when he praises a business model, it's a big deal. And in one of his final interviews, Munger praised Floor & Decor..There are two extremes in retail. One approach is to have a lot of little stores -- GameStop fits in this category. It ended 2024 with over 3,200 locations, which is massive. But each location only had just over $1 million in annual sales..The other approach is to have relatively few stores that handle massive volume, which is Floor & Decor's business model and what Munger loved about it. It follows the same logic as one of his favorite businesses, Costco Wholesale..Floor & Decor only has around 250 locations today and it only expects to have around 500 long term. But each is between 50,000 square feet and 80,000 square feet. And with $4.5 billion in overall trailing-12-month revenue, these 250 stores are certainly high volume..High-volume stores can serve Floor & Decor by creating operating leverage, leading to strong profitability. It's something to watch as the business grows..As mentioned, Floor & Decor is looking to grow to at least 500 locations in coming years. Here in 2025, it's looking to open 20 new stores, which is about 8% growth. But keep in mind that this growth is slow by this company's standards. Given the economic uncertainty right now, management pulled back on this year's plans.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-floor-decor-191400127.html,"```json

53,2025-06-08 18:15:00,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Costco vs. Home Depot,"Costco is humming along, with solid improvement in same-store sales, membership, and new store openings.  Recently, Home Depot has dealt with a demand slowdown, but some factors could start to work in its favor.  When it comes to massive retailers, perhaps two of the businesses that immediately come to mind are Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD).","Costco is humming along, with solid improvement in same-store sales, membership, and new store openings..Recently, Home Depot has dealt with a demand slowdown, but some factors could start to work in its favor..10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale ›.When it comes to massive retailers, perhaps two of the businesses that immediately come to mind are Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD). The former specializes in selling bulk quantities of general merchandise, while the latter focuses on home improvement goods. Shares of both companies have been monster winners in the past four decades..The economic picture might look a bit gloomy. But that isn't stopping you from allocating capital to this sector. Which of these top retail stocks is the better buy right now?.Costco's financial results make you forget that the U.S. is in the middle of an unprecedented trade war, soft consumer confidence, and record levels of credit card debt. During the fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended May 11), total revenue was up 8% year over year. This was supported by a 5.7% gain in same-store sales, which itself was boosted mainly by higher foot traffic..This points to the clear value proposition that shoppers see. And it makes complete sense why. Costco provides extremely low prices on high-quality goods in a no-frills environment. It has immense buying power that allows it to obtain favorable pricing on merchandise for its warehouses. This directly benefits shoppers..The customer base keeps growing, with about 5 million net new cardholders joining in the past 12 months. Costco also benefits from loyalty, as the membership renewal rate was 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada. The business should prove resilient should economic conditions deteriorate, given consumers' ability to handle all of their shopping needs in one stop and in a budget-friendly manner. .This is a massive enterprise. However, the growth story isn't over. Costco plans to end fiscal 2025 having opened 24 net new warehouses. The plan is to expand the physical footprint by about 25 to 30 new stores each year going forward, with plenty of opportunity both in the U.S. and internationally..Home Depot hasn't been navigating the economic situation that well. Higher interest rates pressure the housing market. And inflationary pressures, as well as general uncertainty among consumers, don't bode well for expensive renovation projects. This explains why Home Depot's same-store sales declined 3.2% in fiscal 2023 and 1.8% in fiscal 2024. On a bright note, this key metric is expected to rise 1% this fiscal year, according to management.

54,2025-06-06 01:04:00,Home Depot Bets on Pros Again: Will It Reignite Growth in FY25?,"HD doubles down on Pros with SRS integration and $1 billion in sales gains, aiming to reignite growth amid softness in DIY and big-ticket discretionary demand.","The Home Depot Inc. HD continues to solidify its leadership in the home improvement market, driven by robust momentum in its Professional (“Pro”) customer segment, even as big-ticket discretionary demand remains soft. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, Pro sales outpaced DIY sales, with strong performance in Pro-heavy categories like gypsum, decking, concrete and fencing, highlighting the success of Home Depot’s targeted investments in its Pro ecosystem. Investment in the Pro ecosystem includes expanded delivery capabilities, dedicated sales support and exclusive product lines such as KILZ primers, as the company aims to capture more share in a fragmented $1-trillion market.A major catalyst has been the integration of SRS Distribution, which is now managing trade credit for Home Depot’s Pro customers. Early onboarding has already improved engagement, and management expects credit access to further lift project-based sales. Markets with full Pro capabilities, like flatbed distribution and order systems, are already outperforming, supporting broader expansion plans.Complementing its logistics upgrades, Home Depot is enhancing the Pro experience with specialized sales teams, improved CRM tools, a streamlined B2B website, and loyalty-based pricing programs. These initiatives have already generated more than $1 billion in incremental annualized sales across 17 key markets. With high engagement from Pros across all project sizes, Home Depot remains committed to expanding its Pro market share by continuously enhancing convenience, service and product availability.While macro uncertainty and elevated interest rates continue to dampen demand for big-ticket DIY projects, Home Depot sees significant long-term potential in delayed Pro spending. Backed by a solid customer base, a maturing Pro ecosystem, and strong momentum from SRS Distribution, Home Depot is strategically positioned to capitalize on this pent-up demand—assuming the broader economic backdrop begins to ease..Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW and Floor & Decor FND are key competitors to Home Depot’s Pro business category.Based in Mooresville, NC, Lowe’s is the second pillar of the home improvement retail duopoly, trailing industry leader Home Depot. Both companies cater to millions of homeowners, DIY customers and Pro contractors across North America. However, Lowe’s, operating around 1,740 stores and holding a market cap of $128.2 billion, remains smaller in both scale and reach. While its Pro business is gaining momentum, it still represents roughly 25% of sales compared with more than 50% at Home Depot. Nonetheless, the Pro segment is a strategic priority for Lowe’s, which is actively investing in loyalty programs, dedicated Pro zones, enhanced fulfillment capabilities and upgraded B2B digital tools. Both retailers compete for small to mid-sized Pros, but Home Depot maintains a lead with a more mature ecosystem, particularly in complex project management, trade credit and nationwide Pro delivery. As Lowe’s builds out its Pro infrastructure, it increasingly overlaps with Home Depot in core categories like building materials, electrical and plumbing, though Home Depot continues to dominate when it comes to large-scale, multi-faceted Pro jobs.Floor & Decor is a fast-moving challenger disrupting the hard surface flooring space with a focused, high-growth strategy. By concentrating exclusively on hard surface flooring, FND has carved out a distinct niche, leveraging a specialized, high-volume business model and warehouse-format stores to drive low costs and rapid inventory turns. Floor & Decor resonates strongly with both professional installers and style-driven homeowners through its curated, design-forward offerings at competitive prices. Although FND's Pro market share is still smaller than Home Depot’s, it is gaining ground steadily through a suite of Pro-centric services — dedicated support teams, mobile ordering and exclusive volume-based pricing. While HD commands a broader reach and infrastructure advantage, particularly in general home improvement, Floor & Decor directly overlaps with HD in flooring solutions, wherein it competes on depth, specialization and Pro-focused execution.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-bets-pros-again-170400878.html,"```json

56,2025-06-04 22:49:00,Home Depot Stock's High P/E: Justified Premium or Too Pricey to Buy?,HD's premium valuation raises eyebrows as soft big-ticket sales and economic caution weigh on near-term growth.,"The Home Depot Inc. HD has been witnessing a downtrend in recent months, owing to soft engagement for big-ticket discretionary categories, such as kitchen and bath remodels, as higher interest rates discouraged financing-dependent projects. However, the company has maintained its leadership position in the home improvement market through ongoing investments in technology, digital capabilities and supply-chain efficiency.Backed by its strong market position, HD commands a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.05X, higher than the Zacks Retail – Home Furnishing industry average of 20.93X. This multiple is making the stock appear relatively expensive, raising concerns about whether the stock's valuation is justified.The high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of Home Depot, an Atlanta, GA-based home improvement retailer, adds to investor unease, especially considering its low Value Score of D, which suggests that it may not be a strong value proposition at current levels. The company has a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 2.23X compared with the industry’s 1.52X.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.At 24.05X forward 12-month P/E, HD is trading at a valuation much higher than its competitors. Its competitors, such as Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. ETD and Williams-Sonoma WSM, are delivering solid growth and trade at more reasonable multiples. Lowe’s, Ethan Allen and Williams-Sonoma have respective forward 12-month P/E ratios of 18.06X, 10.35X and 18.59X — all lower than Home Depot. At such levels, the HD stock’s valuation seems out of step with its growth trajectory.The stock’s premium valuation suggests that investors have strong expectations for Home Depot. However, the stock currently seems somewhat overvalued. As a result, investors might be hesitant to buy at these elevated levels and prefer to wait for a more favorable entry point.While HD’s share price has decreased 4.1% in the past month, it has outperformed the broader industry’s 8.6% decline. At this point, many investors are questioning whether Home Depot’s stock is a buy after the recent dip. However, the stock still underperforms the Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2% and 0.4%, respectively, in the same period.Moreover, HD’s performance is notably stronger than that of its competitors, Lowe’s, Ethan Allen and Williams-Sonoma, which have declined 7.3%, 5.7% and 12.8%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-stocks-high-p-144900654.html,"```json

But unlike the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which has just over 500 components, or the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), which has a few thousand stocks, the Dow only contains 30 components..Each company in the Dow is meant to represent a major stock market sector or industry. As representatives, Dow companies tend to be reliable, industry-leading businesses -- making the Dow a good place to look for blue chip stocks..Here's why Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) stand out as top Dow stocks to buy now..Scott Levine (Chevron): With the midpoint of 2025 nearly upon us, it's a great time to look back on how things have fared so far and to take action if necessary. For those eager to start a new position, Chevron is a strong consideration right now. While the stock's performance this year has been unfavorable, it should certainly not dissuade patient investors with long investing horizons. Of course, the stock's 5% forward dividend yield doesn't hurt either..An oil supermajor, Chevron has robust operations throughout the energy value chain. This, in part, helps the company weather downturns in energy prices -- something that savvy investors know well. For example, while the price of oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate has dropped nearly 12% since the start of the year, shares of Chevron have only dipped 3.5% lower at the time of this writing..Furthermore, with energy prices lower, management has taken steps to ensure that the company's financial position remains strong. In addition to a $2 billion reduction in capital expenditures from 2024, management aims to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2026..Illustrating further the company's resilience during downturns in energy prices, Chevron has consistently hiked its dividend higher for 38 consecutive years -- a period that has certainly seen its share of plunging oil prices. And all the while, the company has continued rewarding shareholders and growing the business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-rock-solid-dow-jones-111500450.html,"```json

Nevertheless, policy uncertainty, primarily linked to the unpredictable nature of Trump’s tariffs and ongoing legal disputes, is eroding both consumer and business confidence..For 2025, the NRF anticipates retail sales to expand between 2.7% and 3.7%, hitting between $5.42 trillion and $5.48 trillion. This outlook is consistent with 2024’s 3.6% sales growth ($5.29 trillion) and matches the 3.6% average annual growth recorded in the ten years prior to the pandemic. Even with these broader economic trends, the retail sector confronts unique challenges..This second part of our series will delve into how other retailers are reacting to ongoing tariff issues and the implications for investors in this volatile climate. (Read Part 1 here now)..Home Depot missed Q1 earnings expectations but reaffirmed its full-year guidance — a signal of operational confidence despite economic headwinds and tariff pressures. CFO Richard McPhail emphasized that the company does not plan to raise prices in response to tariffs, citing Home Depot’s size, strong supplier relationships, and ongoing productivity gains as buffers..More than half of the company’s inventory is U.S.-sourced, and McPhail noted that no single country outside the U.S. will represent more than 10% of imports by next year — reflecting a long-term shift away from Chinese dependence. The company has been steadily diversifying its supply chain for years..However, with high interest rates dampening home improvement demand and tariffs threatening product costs, executives acknowledged that if certain items become too expensive to source under current trade policy, they may simply be removed from the shelves. For now, Home Depot is betting on scale and flexibility, while keeping pricing steady to maintain customer loyalty in a cooling housing market..Lowe’s reported a smaller-than-expected Q1 sales drop, thanks in part to steady demand from professional contractors. Like its rival Home Depot, Lowe’s said it aims to remain price competitive, although it did not rule out increases in the second half of the year when newer, tariff-impacted inventory reaches shelves..CFO Brandon Sink expects flat profit margins this fiscal year, signaling that Lowe’s is absorbing some near-term cost pressures. About 60% of Lowe’s products are sourced from the U.S., while 20% still come from China. The company has expanded its network of local suppliers and diversified its sourcing to cushion the tariff blow.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-tags-price-hike-reality-091518508.html,"```json

60,2025-06-01 19:12:00,2 American Companies That Could Be the Winners of Trump's Tariff Wars,"Trump's tariff wars have brought outsize uncertainty to the stock market, making it increasingly challenging to identify companies positioned to weather the storm.","One of the key objectives behind President Trump's tariffs is to bolster domestic manufacturing..While inflation remains a hot-button issue and mortgage rates are still relatively elevated, the home improvement industry could be an under-the-radar opportunity right now..Rising infrastructure spend in the U.S. could help spark demand for domestic steel producers..10 stocks we like better than Home Depot ›.It's been almost two months since President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement, during which he presented a litany of new tariff policies in an effort to level set trade relations which major partners such as China, Europe, and Canada..Since the April 2 announcement, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average have each experienced double-digit declines -- only to rebound sharply over the last few weeks as some updated trade deals have come into view. Even though the market has been roaring as of late, I don't think investors are out of the woods quite yet..Tariff policies can change swiftly, and for now, it's still difficult to discern what companies may come out stronger as a result of these new trade deals..Below, I'll detail how tariffs work and highlight two companies I think could emerge as winners of Trump's tariff wars..Tariffs are a tax that are placed on imported or exported goods. Generally speaking, tariffs are employed as a mechanism to bring other countries to the table and negotiate new terms in trade deals..In addition, tariffs can also be a way to put some pressure on companies to increase domestic manufacturing as opposed to outsourcing labor overseas..While this might sound nice in theory, economists worry that more manufacturing investment in the U.S. will be a costly endeavor for businesses -- hence, they may choose to pass those expenses on to the consumer, thereby spurring inflation..During periods of inflation or high interest rates, consumers may put off investing in home improvement projects or purchasing real estate altogether. While that might give investors some initial feeling of trepidation for Home Depot (NYSE: HD), there's more to the picture..Homeowners know all too well that some projects simply cannot be ignored. Considering the home improvement industry in the U.S. is essentially a duopoly between Home Depot and Lowe's, the company is still positioned to absorb a lot of this demand..Per the graph above, investors can see that over the last two decades, Home Depot has been able to consistently increase revenue and operating margins -- even during times of economic uncertainty. For reference, the two grey-shaded columns represent U.S. recessions. Although there was some pullback in Home Depot's business during these times, the company was ultimately able to outmaneuver these challenges. I see the current tariff situation as no different.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-american-companies-could-winners-111200549.html,"```json

61,2025-06-01 16:40:00,These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2025 and Beyond,The market may be too distracted by all the recent noise to notice that these stocks are underperforming for all the wrong reasons.,"It feels like the home building and home improvement industries are in trouble. A closer look shows that may not be the case..It’s taken a while to get the job done, but the current, rebuilt version of Walt Disney is incredibly promising..Walmart might be categorized as a brick-and-mortar retailer, but it’s actually evolved into a lifestyle company..10 stocks we like better than Home Depot ›.These are tricky times for investors. Oh, the market's never exactly easy to navigate. Things are proving particularly unpredictable right now, however. Some tickers are performing well when they seemingly shouldn't be, while others are lagging when they should be soaring. Never even mind all the uncertainty stemming from the ongoing tariff wars..If you can take a step back and look through all the near-term fuzziness at the bigger picture though, many of the market's long-term winners become clear. Three of its best bets right now, in fact, are blue chip stocks that help make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here's a closer look at each one and why they're all likely to soar this year ... and beyond..At first blush, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) seems like a name to avoid right now. Consumers are feeling fiscally pinched, and mortgage loan rates are holding near multi-year highs. Both work against a home improvement retailer that relies on professional contractors for half of its revenue (which, of course, means the other half comes from consumers themselves)..Be wary of jumping to conclusions based on a mere perception of data, however. Things may not be quite as dire as they appear at this time..Take, for instance, last month's sales of newly built homes. Despite the challenging economic environment, the U.S. Census Bureau reports April's new home sales reached a multi-year high annualized pace of 743,000 units. Meanwhile, the Conference Board's consumer-confidence measure for May bounced back quite a bit from April's plunge, with expectations that international trade deals will turn constructive again soon enough. Harvard University's Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) index indicates that remodeling and home-upgrade outlays are likely to grow 2.5% through the first quarter of the coming year. That's not exactly thrilling, but it is a nice turnaround from last year's 1.5% dip..This stock's weakness since the beginning of the year doesn't reflect any of this upside..Just don't tarry if you want to capitalize on the mostly unmerited pullback. Even if you're not looking for dividend income right now, you'll be plugging in while this ticker's forward-looking dividend yield stands at a healthy 2.5%. That's not a bad little add-on perk for owning a stock that could -- and likely will -- start soaring at the first real hint of an economic rebound. It's just going to take a little patience.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dow-stocks-set-soar-084000222.html,"```json

While these stocks can still experience dips with the broader market, the regular cash deposits made into your account can help you stay optimistic about your financial future..If you're thinking about adding reliable dividend payers to your portfolio right now, here are two industry-leading businesses that could potentially pay you for the rest of your life..Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a staple brand for many households. While it doesn't offer a lot of growth, the stock has held up relatively well against market volatility in recent years. It has an excellent dividend payment record and currently offers an attractive yield that is double the S&P 500 average..At the current quarterly payout of $0.51, the stock's forward dividend yield is 2.85%. The company just raised the quarterly payment for the 63rd consecutive year, indicating a resilient business through economic cycles..Coca-Cola is more than its namesake brand. It owns dozens of brands across juices, tea, energy, and water, so it offers a beverage product for just about any consumer preference. Its product diversity also helps the business generate steady sales year to year. Despite economic uncertainty in the first quarter, Coca-Cola's adjusted revenue grew 6% year over year, with unit case volume up 2%..Tariffs could affect Coca-Cola's financial results this year, but only marginally. Based on what management has seen so far, it expects adjusted earnings to increase 7% to 9% in 2025. Given its trailing 12-month payout ratio of 77%, more earnings growth should support further increases in the dividend..This rate of growth is consistent with management's long-term expectations. While Coca-Cola is a global brand, it still has significant opportunities in emerging markets, where people consume fewer commercial beverage products than in developed countries..The company raised the dividend by 5% this year, and that's a reasonable expectation for its long-term growth in revenue, earnings, and dividends. Coca-Cola stock has been a favorite holding of Warren Buffett for many years and can certainly help you grow your savings..Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is the leading home improvement retailer. Favorable homeownership trends have driven rising demand for its services over the years. This has made the stock a rewarding investment. A $10,000 investment 20 years ago would be worth $151,000 today, including dividend reinvestment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-magnificent-dividend-stocks-buy-081500630.html,"```json

Although the company remains exposed to broader macroeconomic pressures, such as a slowdown in housing development, I believe it’s well-positioned for a strong rebound as conditions stabilize. As outlined in the following sections, this underpins my long-term bullish outlook on the stock..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.Currently, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 30%, down from the previous 145% following a temporary 90-day agreement between the U.S. and China, set to expire in early July. Unlike many of its peers, particularly Walmart, Home Depot is less reliant on imports, with over 50% of its products sourced domestically. The company has been actively reducing its dependency on any single country since the early days of the Trump administration..This strategic positioning could allow Home Depot to gain market share, especially if tariff-driven price disparities widen. While some interpret Home Depot’s decision to hold prices as a form of virtue signaling or political calculation, possibly aimed at avoiding friction with former President Trump, such speculation remains unconfirmed. What is clear, however, is that Home Depot’s lower tariff exposure provides it with a competitive advantage in the current trade environment..Home Depot remains particularly exposed to pressures in the housing market, as a significant portion of its business comes from professionals such as contractors, builders, and plumbers. On its most recent earnings call, the company acknowledged that elevated interest rates are prompting many homeowners to delay major renovation projects. The broader housing landscape isn’t offering much relief either—30-year mortgage rates remain above 7%, and home sales have slowed to their weakest pace since 2009..These high rates are creating a “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are reluctant to trade up and give up lower mortgage rates, ultimately reducing housing turnover and shifting demand toward smaller, DIY-style projects..Despite these headwinds, Home Depot is well-positioned for a rebound when housing activity improves, which many experts expect to occur by 2026. The company’s scale provides it with strong bargaining power to help contain vendor-driven price increases. Additionally, Home Depot is reinforcing its focus on the professional segment, highlighted by its $18.25 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution last year, a strategic move to deepen its footprint in the pro market.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-hd-eyes-stock-212600231.html,"```json

While the near term could be rocky, investors who buy the following dividend stocks today could build up a rewarding stream of passive income for years to come.","This retail giant is slumping, but it offers a very attractive dividend..Investors have a rare opportunity to invest in this leading coffee brand at a high yield..This retailer will benefit from an eventual recovery in the housing market..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.This is a great time to consider adding quality dividend stocks to your investment portfolio. Recent headwinds in the economy have weighed on sales of leading retail and consumer goods brands, and this has driven their stocks down and their yields higher..While the near term could be rocky, investors who buy the following dividend stocks today could build up a rewarding stream of passive income for years to come. Here's why three Fool.com contributors believe Target (NYSE: TGT), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) are great dividend stocks to buy and hold for the next 20 years..Jennifer Saibil (Target): Target is a great example of a company that's rebounded from challenges and gone on to soaring heights. It's in the dumps right now, but it's been there before. In fact, it was struggling right before the pandemic, and it invested in a robust omnichannel strategy before it was fashionable and just in time to benefit from a huge acceleration in e-commerce. Throughout its current struggles, its digital channels, including same-day and pickup services, continue to enjoy strong growth. That should give investors some confidence that it can rebound again under better conditions..There are several reasons Target is under pressure today. Grocery, which as a category does well under most conditions, isn't as large a segment for Target as it is for some of its competitors. As customers have pulled back on discretionary purchases due to inflation, sales growth has been slow or non-existent, and it's had to mark down items to get them off shelves, cutting into its margins. It's been the target (no pun intended) of several politically based consumer boycott efforts, which cut into recent sales, and all of these things have led to reduced consumer confidence in Target. Now there's the looming threat of tariffs, which had some impact on Target's business in the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended May 3), and are creating uncertainty about the near future..Comparable sales dropped 3.8% from last year in the first quarter, although operating income increased 13.6%. Same-day delivery increased 35% year over year, driving a 4.7% increase in comparable digital sales. This is where Target shines, even now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-dividend-stocks-down-120000365.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter. .The Home Depot tapped Angie Brown to lead technology strategy, infrastructure, cybersecurity and software development Thursday. Brown was appointed as EVP and CIO after 27 years with the home improvement retailer, the company said..Brown previously worked across virtually every aspect of the company's IT operations, most recently managing technology for merchandising, customer experience, marketing, reliability engineering and supply chain functions as SVP of IT. “Her strategic vision and deep expertise have been instrumental in transforming Home Depot's interconnected experience, making home improvement more modern, more seamless and more convenient,"" Chair, President and CEO Ted Decker said in the announcement..The appointment marks the departure of Fahim Siddiqui, who was elevated from SVP of IT to EVP and CIO shortly after Decker began his tenure as CEO in 2022. “Fahim has been instrumental in improving our infrastructure across our stores, supply chain facilities and support centers,” Decker said.

CEO Ted Decker noted that customer engagement for smaller projects and spring-related purchases remained strong, although high interest rates continued to dampen spending on major remodels. Management emphasized positive comparable sales in several key merchandise departments, such as appliances, plumbing, and building materials, while also highlighting growth in Pro customer sales and digital engagement. Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President, pointed to investments in associate training and technology—such as new generative AI tools—as supporting improved customer service and operational efficiency..Looking ahead, Home Depot’s management is focused on navigating external uncertainties, including tariffs and high interest rates, while reaffirming their outlook for the remainder of the year. CFO Richard McPhail stated that operating margins are expected to decline slightly, driven by natural deleverage, the ongoing integration of SRS (a recent acquisition), and the transition to a standard 52-week year. Management believes that diversification in global sourcing will limit the impact of tariffs on costs, and ongoing investments in digital tools and the Pro ecosystem are expected to help capture additional market share. Ted Decker commented, “We remain bullish on the fundamentals of home improvement,” but acknowledged that a broad recovery in larger project spending will likely hinge on improved macroeconomic confidence and lower financing costs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hd-q1-earnings-call-revenue-185349410.html,"```json

That's a respectable gain, but some companies have performed significantly better..Since this company's initial public offering in September 1981, it has generated a monster total return of 3,157,000% (as of May 22), crushing the broader benchmark. This means that had you invested $1,000 over four decades ago, you'd be sitting on an unbelievable balance of nearly $32 million today. This is a truly astonishing outcome..Continue reading to learn more about this business and its rise, as well as what investors should do with the stock right now..It's rare to see companies remain relatively the same over time. But this is precisely the case with Home Depot (NYSE: HD), which has put up such a tremendous return for shareholders over the years.. Decades ago, the business was selling things like lumber, electrical supplies, and hardware to both do-it-yourself shoppers and professional customers. This hasn't changed. .The only thing different now is just how massive Home Depot has become. This company carries a market cap of $365 billion. And in the past 12 months, it registered revenue of $163 billion, undoubtedly making it one of the biggest retailers on the face of the planet. That figure is roughly double what Lowe's collected in sales, the company's key rival in the industry..An important part of the strategy was to rapidly open new stores. In 1993, which is the earliest data available on the Securities and Exchange website, Home Depot had 264 stores in operation. Early executives understood that success at existing locations could probably be replicated. As of May 4 of this year, there were 2,350 Home Depot stores in total, with 182 in Canada and 140 in Mexico. The company is so ubiquitous that there's a store within 10 miles of 90% of the population in the U.S..Home Depot now generates consistent profits, with its operating margin averaging 14.2% in the past decade. This allows the leadership team to return capital to shareholders.

Analysts at Wolfe cited home improvement’s relative resilience compared to homebuilding, despite softening remodeling demand and the lingering effects of inflation. They acknowledged that a dip in comparable sales is a risk, but believe it is already factored into the current share price..ThreeRivers11 / Shutterstock.com.A key concern remains the impact of sluggish existing home sales on renovation activity. Elevated interest rates have cooled housing turnover, typically a major driver of remodeling. Still, Wolfe maintains that Home Depot’s scale and customer base place it in a strong position as conditions stabilize. Wolfe adjusted its earnings per share (EPS) forecasts, now expecting $14.93 for fiscal 2024 (down from $15.21) and $15.38 for 2025 (down from $16.19)..These estimates are consistent with market consensus. The new $392 price target reflects a 25.5x multiple on 2025 projected EPS, suggesting optimism around a gradual recovery in demand. Currently, Home Depot, Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses..The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is the largest home improvement retailer in America. It’s a frequently discussed stock on Cramer’s morning show. The CNBC TV host also talks about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in his evening show, Mad Money. His recent Mad Money remarks saw Cramer comment that high interest rates sapped the life out of an otherwise strong gardening season that is a boon for the company. Cramer added that while The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)’s shares typically don’t fluctuate in response to interest rates, the rates’ impact on gardening might be ushering in a change. Here are his latest thoughts:.“By the way, the retail group is total chaos today. I mean Home Depot’s back down. . .”.A home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies..Earlier this month on Mad Money, Cramer had commented:.“Now, not that long ago, we dropped in on a monster Home Depot store management meeting in Vegas where we heard about some great ideas for spring gardening season, which by the way, kicks into overdrive this weekend. Unfortunately, these big weeks for lawn and garden have been overshadowed by stubbornly high interest rates and no rate cuts from the Fed, not to mention tariff worries. Now I’ve watched this stock since it came public, and there are plenty of times that Home Depot doesn’t actually march to the tune of interest rates, but instead is levered to repair and renovation..Overall, HD ranks 10th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of HD, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-inc-nyse-hd-170501890.html,"```json

The home improvement giant faces headwinds like tariff pressures, a sluggish housing market, and rising financing costs, which have dulled its shine. With sales growth slowing and earnings forecasts underwhelming, the stock will likely remain under pressure, especially given that Home Depot’s valuation isn’t particularly attractive. As a result, I am leaning bearish on HD stock..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.Tariffs are hitting Home Depot hard, especially with nearly half its sales tied to imported goods. The U.S. recently adjusted tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and slapped a 10% duty on other countries, which, while a short-term breather, continues to mess with orders and pricing. CFO Richard McPhail emphasized during the Q1 earnings call that Home Depot won’t raise prices to offset these costs, choosing instead to absorb them or tweak its product lineup. This strategy will protect customers, but it will also squeeze margins, which already took a 40-basis-point hit in Q, partly due to tariffs. With trade policies still in flux, this pressure will not likely ease soon..Fortunately, the company’s diversified supply chain and strong pro business (50% of sales) give it some wiggle room compared to rivals like Lowe’s, which relies more on Chinese imports. However, absorbing a blended tariff cost on goods in the mid-single-digits isn’t trivial. If trade tensions heat up, Home Depot could be forced to ditch its no-price-increase policy, which might tick off customers or squeeze profits even more. For now, tariffs are a persistent pain in the neck..In the meantime, the housing market is in a funk, and Home Depot is naturally feeling the pinch. High mortgage rates, now hovering close to 7%, have frozen homebuyers, slowing turnover and big-ticket renovation projects. Evidently, even though Q1 sales reached $39.86 billion, up 9.4% year-over-year, comparable sales dipped 0.3%, signaling weaker demand for major projects. Customers are sticking to smaller jobs, like spring gardening, which boosted transactions by 2.1% but didn’t move the needle on average ticket size..I believe squeezed consumer spending power and high rates will suppress demand for pricey remodels. Indeed, Home Depot’s guidance assumes this trend lasts, with management noting “continued pressure on larger projects” in the earnings call. With no clear catalyst like falling rates or a housing rebound on the horizon, this headwind could linger into late 2025, keeping sales growth muted.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-quick-fix-home-depot-190500773.html,"```json

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Home Depot (HD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this home-improvement retailer have returned +1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +8.2% change. The Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry, to which Home Depot belongs, has gained 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Home Depot is expected to post earnings of $4.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.04 points to a change of -1.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.43 indicates a change of +9.3% from what Home Depot is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Home Depot.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-inc-hd-trending-130013328.html,"```json

With $163 billion in trailing-12-month sales, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is not only the clear leader in the home improvement industry, but it's undoubtedly one of the biggest retailers in the world.  Here are three facts you should know about Home Depot before buying this top retail stock.","Home Depot generates a sizable chunk of its sales from professional customers, which helps boost the company’s financial metrics..Macro headwinds have been impacting the business, but there are long-term industry tailwinds to keep in mind..The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade, but the valuation looks expensive today..10 stocks we like better than Home Depot ›.With $163 billion in trailing-12-month sales, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is not only the clear leader in the home improvement industry, but it's undoubtedly one of the biggest retailers in the world. Shares have performed well in the past decade, producing a total return of 319%..But as of this writing, they trade 15% below their peak price. This might prompt you to take a closer look at the company. Here are three facts you should know about Home Depot before buying this top retail stock..Home Depot sells building materials, outdoor equipment, and paint, among many other items, to do-it-yourself (DIY) customers. But the business also targets professionals, including contractors, plumbers, and electricians. It's this latter group that represents about half of the company's total revenue base. That share is substantially higher than what rival Lowe's sees, which is about a 25% share from pros..This has some implications for Home Depot's business. First, pros generally spend much more money and visit stores more frequently than DIY customers. This makes sense, given that DIYers are probably only tackling one project, while a pro could be working on multiple job sites. .For Home Depot, this results in better financial metrics. Home Depot's return on invested capital and operating margin have both generally been better than Lowe's. There are other factors involved, but Home Depot's stronger foothold with professionals deserves some credit here. .In the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2025, ended May 4), executive vice president of merchandising Billy Bastek said on the earnings call, ""Pro comp sales were positive and outpaced the DIY customer."" .In fiscal 2020 and 2021, Home Depot's sales surged 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. These above-average rates of growth were boosted by heightened demand from households to take on home upgrades during the depths of the pandemic. .Since then, there's been a normalization of these trends. Home Depot reported same-store sales declines of 3.2% in fiscal 2023, 1.8% in fiscal 2024, and 0.3% in Q1 2025. Clearly, tighter macro conditions have presented a major headwind.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-must-know-facts-home-121500709.html,"```json

This comes as homeowners are spending less on home repairs and DIY projects as they feel more stressed, stemming from economic uncertainties..Angi Co-Founder Angie Hicks comes on Wealth for a conversation on why homeowners are delaying repairs and home renovation projects..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here..Shares of Lowe's lower after reporting better than expected earnings and growing sales from professionals offsetting weakness in the DIY consumer. Homeowners continue to spend less on big ticket items though amid broader economic uncertainty. Angie's 2025 state of home spending report found that 48% of homeowners are more stressed about home repairs than they were in January. Joining me now, we've got Angie Hicks, Angie co-founder. Angie, we got to ask you first and foremost, where is a lot of the stress coming from for homeowners? .I think quite honestly when it comes to taking care of your home, it's for most of us our largest asset. And we tend to spend, you know, one to two percent of the value of the home on improvements and repairs each year. So it really comes down to kind of budgeting and understanding what needs to be done around your house and how to best invest those dollars. .And so from what you're hearing, are there massive delays in in some of the DIY projects that homeowners would typically be doing? .Well we did run a pulse survey to update our state of home spending in April and saw that 70% of homeowners said they had delayed a project. But I think what you really need to understand here is what that, you know, actually means. We also found that they're doing more maintenance which is very common, it's a very common phenomena when we see an economic downturn or uncertainty. Because what they want to do is not be surprised. They don't want to be surprised by spending, so they're going to make sure they're getting their air conditioner tuned up so it doesn't go out on the hottest day of the year. Have the roof inspected so they don't have a leak. So they become just much more conscientious about those day-to-day things. And they're going to do less discretionary items, more non-discretionary. So maybe we're not putting the swimming pool in this year, but we are still going to make sure that we're maintaining that house. So you see some shifts going on there, and quite honestly some of those DIY projects might fall in that discretionary bucket that they might choose to hold off on. .Yeah, we had a perfectly good blow-up pool at one point when we were going up. So ultimately just go stand next to a hose for a little bit. Yeah, exactly. So, as you think about some of the lower cost alternatives to full remodels, because those are some of the projects that homeowners will take on if they're looking to maybe list their home within the next 12 months, what are you hearing on that front? What's the pulse? .Yeah, so a lot of times uh kitchens and bathrooms are always at the top of the renovation list. And you know, a lot of times people think are these tens of thousands of dollars of projects. Yes, they can be. Some can be very big projects, but there are a lot of things that you can do to make it even a more efficient uh project economical and get functionality. For example, in your kitchen, if you want a fresher look, consider updating the countertops. If you're going to avoid updating the cabinets, that's where the big money is and do not change the footprint of your kitchen if you can, because if you start moving plumbing and electrical, the cost starts to add up. Same kind of thing in the bathroom. Think about maybe changing out the flooring, updating a sink, but if you're going to redo your whole shower, it's going to be more expensive. .And so how are the pros on the other side of this responding to what homeowners are ultimately signaling to them, the market, the the professionals that are also working on these projects? .Absolutely. So the professionals are working with homeowners more, talking to them about alternatives. You know, I've I've just had our Angie uh Pro Council meeting the other day. We were talking a lot with pros about the different things that they see where they can kind of help homeowners make trade-offs and make good decisions about how to invest those dollars. Uh and you know, and and they're looking for uh uh sorry, and they also are looking at ways that they can aggregate projects together. Uh so you know, if they offer both window cleaning and gutter cleaning, suggesting consumers get those done together be so that it's one trip and it can be a more efficient economical job. .What is the decision tree for whether or not you should actually be starting a new project right now? .Well, I mean, first you need to think about your budget. Look at your budget, understand how much you have to spend. And also I always encourage homeowners to do a walk around your house and evaluate everything you see because you might choose to do the wrong project, and we don't want people to do that. You know, so you want to start with structural problems, then go to mechanical things and then work your way to more cosmetic kind of more upgrade type items. So do that so that you know, like, hey, my refrigerators on its last leg. Uh you don't go and put a new deck on and then realize come August that you need to buy a refrigerator and you feel the crunch. .Angie, great to see you. Thanks so much for taking the time as always. .Thank you. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/homeowners-feeling-especially-stressed-home-140025695.html,"```json

With operating margins typically in the narrow 4% to 5% range, the company faces difficult trade-offs between absorbing costs or passing them on to consumers, challenging its low-price core value proposition..Nevertheless, Walmart’s massive scale, strong brand, and strategic agility position it better than most in navigating these pressures, leaving me tentatively optimistic about the stock’s resilience in the face of ongoing trade uncertainty..Walmart’s latest quarterly results were solid, with revenue reaching $165.6 billion—a 2.5% year-over-year increase—and operating margins holding steady at 4.3%. However, the recent wave of global tariffs has injected uncertainty into the outlook, prompting the company to withdraw its second-quarter operating margin guidance. CFO John David Rainey signaled that price hikes are inevitable..While Walmart has reduced its reliance on Chinese imports from 80% in 2018 to around 60% today, China still supplies approximately 15% of its total merchandise—particularly in categories like electronics and toys. Starting in May, and escalating in June, Walmart will begin raising prices across most product lines, a move that drew sharp criticism from President Trump..Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are pushing back against suppliers asked to absorb tariff costs, leaving U.S. retailers like Walmart caught in the middle. Although recent negotiations between the U.S. and China led to a partial rollback of tariffs from previous highs, the current levels still present a significant cost burden, one that even a giant like Walmart is struggling to absorb..Walmart isn’t alone in navigating the challenges posed by tariffs—retailers like Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT) are also being forced to adapt. Home Depot has chosen a different path, opting to discontinue certain product lines and diversify its supply chain rather than raise prices. Target, on the other hand, is increasing prices on select items after lowering its sales forecast.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-tells-walmart-wmt-173300706.html,"```json

Same-store sales (SSS) declined 0.3% in the fiscal 2025 first quarter. This follows a 1.8% drop in fiscal 2024 and a 3.2% fall in fiscal 2023. It makes sense that when households are worried about the economy, they will hesitate to spend on expensive home improvements. .There are reasons to be optimistic about the long term. The home improvement industry is massive, estimated to be worth $1 trillion. Home Depot commands just 16% market share. It should be able to win customers over from smaller stores that don't have the same inventory availability or omnichannel capabilities..The leadership team calls out the trillions of dollars of untapped home equity that has been built up since the start of the pandemic. This should create pent-up demand for Home Depot should macro conditions ease up..Homes in this country are also getting older. ""The housing stock is aging, and 55% of homes are 40 years or older,"" CEO Ted Decker said on the Q1 2025 earnings call. ""And we know that as homes get older, they require more maintenance and updates."" This supports revenue growth for Home Depot in the future..Costco shines bright when viewed next to Home Depot. The company continues to report positive SSS growth, showcasing the durable demand it experiences. Even in difficult economic times, consumers should flock to Costco to buy whatever they need at low prices and in bulk quantities.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-costco-better-stock-143000841.html,"```json

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.","After a busy week of retail earnings, with Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) reporting results, Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry comes on Market Domination to talk retailer stocks and designating three winners of the sector..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..All right. Big box stores, meanwhile, are reporting quarterly earnings this week, and while it's been a mixed bag for retailers, some names are rising above the competition in the tariff landscape. We're now figuring out how to play the retail sector with the Yahoo Finance playbook, and joining us now is Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. Brian, it is always great to see you. So let's, let's compare and contrast some of the big names in this space, Brian. Get your take on how you kind of see them. One of the first ones would be the obvious one, Walmart and Target. Now, you might throw up those stock charts, Brian, and you can see how that kind of tells the story. Uh, we did recently, this week, Brian, we had a target bull on the show, and I think his argument was more valuation. He just thought a lot of the bad news had been priced into Target. I'm curious how you see it. .Yeah, I certainly understand the argument. I mean, Target's down close to 40% on a year-to-date basis. There is a point where the valuation starts to become a little bit more attractive, but for us, it has to start with some type of earnings growth, and we're just not seeing it, at least in the near term, for Target. They're still continuing to struggle with some legacy issues from COVID, in terms of getting their inventory timing down properly. And now you throw, on top of that, the issue that they still have around 30% of their goods directly sourced from China. So they're really struggling to get things right, to turn the corner, and look better from an earnings growth that profitability picture just isn't clear enough for us to like the name. On the other side, you've got Walmart. They've got a little bit more diversity in their product lineup, and that's showing in the sales growth that they have. You know, April retail sales, I think, came in as a surprise for all of us, and that just, it was positive. It was up 0.1%, but that's $721 billion out there for grabs for these big box retailers, at this moment in time. And what we found in Walmart's earnings is their average ticket size is going up. So foot traffic is roughly flat, maybe slightly lower, but they're getting more wallet share from consumers. And that's the biggest difference between the two stocks right now. You have consistent revenue growth, and consistent profit growth from Walmart, and Target is almost the other side of the coin, almost the complete opposite. .All right. We need a little, like, ding ding ding to talk about the second round here. Um, so let's talk about two other retailers. So clearly you think Walmart has the advantage between Walmart and Target. What about Home Depot and Lowe's, two other retailers we heard from this week, um, and you know, taking a different approach in a number of different areas, including on tariffs. .Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, the news that we got from Home Depot is that here, very soon, their overall exposure to China, and the reason we keep bringing up China is it's the worst-case scenario. The maximum level of tariffs that we know about in this point in time, coming out of China. That's where it impacts earnings over a long period of time. Home Depot says, ""Very quickly, we're going to have less than 10% exposure."" And that adds a lot more durability to their long-term profit structure. Home Depot has also made a lot of investments linking customers to contractors, getting jobs done. And in that retail sales number from April, building materials were up 0.8%. It was one of the bigger drivers in there. And so we saw that reflected in a little bit stronger, I think, than expected numbers from Home Depot coming out of Q1, and they're doing a really good job of managing that long-term profit structure, mitigating the cost of tariffs. And so it's a name that we like more than Lowe's, for similar reasons. Lowe's has more of a DIY type of a feel. And unfortunately, the customers at this point don't want to do it themselves. They want to be connected to that pro segment. Now, Lowe's is growing there. It's one of the faster-growing segments of their business, but they're just really far behind the curve when it comes to those types of projects. And Home Depot's really built a whole system around that pro experience for contractors and bulk orders, and also connecting them to consumers to get jobs done. So we're just finding the integration and the money already spent on that growth is paying off for Home Depot. .And how would you characterize valuation, Brian? I mean, you must find it compelling here. .Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think there's a really good story here. I mean, there's a lot of people out there that are going to be anchored to their properties because they have a 2 or 2.5, 3% mortgage rate. So they're going to continue to stay with those properties, but want to improve them over time. So given the current valuation and the long-term revenue growth, this is a very strong company that has a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and they also want to make sure that they're staying in line with that strong balance sheet directive that they've had over the last three years. It's really paying off well for them because they have low levels of debt. Lowe's, on the other hand, is very leveraged. They have a lot of debt on their balance sheet. And so again, just in terms of where you're assessing risk versus reward over this period of time, Home Depot definitely seems more attractive. .All right. Advantage Home Depot in that round. Round three, we got TJX versus Kohl's. You know, I don't know if this one's quite a fair fight, to be honest, Brian, but talk me through your thinking on these two. .Yeah. So I mean they're almost not even in the same ballpark. If tariffs are your main concern, and we could understand why, TJ Maxx has a variety of ways to source inventory, and sometimes they can buy directly from unsold department store inventories that have already paid tariffs, if there were any, to begin with. So they have a way of getting goods on shelves that are in demand. We all love the name brands that you can find at TJ Maxx and HomeGoods, and pay, obviously, discount prices. There is a model there where TJ Maxx has some exposure to direct manufacturers that come from the Pacific Rim regions, and China being part of that, but they have a way to mitigate that through multiple levels of sourcing. Whereas Kohl's, again, they're still too dependent on China directly to get products on shelves. It's roughly 20 to 25% of anything that you find inside a Kohl's store is going to be subject to those maximum levels of tariffs right now. Again, just putting a lot of pressure on the near-term profit structure that is also weighing down long-term growth. So it really comes down to, know what you own, know why you own it. And at this point, if you're just paying attention to some of those finer details, higher quality balance sheets are winning the day. .At the same time, Brian, you look at that Kohl's stock chart, and this stock has been shelled, Brian. I mean, how much, you obviously just don't think all the bad news is priced in there. .No, I think that they're just not getting things right in terms of sourcing and controlling costs at this moment in time. Unfortunately, I think there's more volatility to come because they just simply can't right the ship and turn a corner to profitability. They're having to continue to further discount goods, weighing on margins. Their average ticket sales is going down at this point in time. So they're having to find different ways to incentivize customers. Adding too many incentives means you're weighing on that profitability. So they can still have a certain amount of top-line sales that keeps the business running, but they're still squeezing that overall profitability, quarter after quarter after quarter. I don't think all the bad news is quite priced in just yet. .Brian, always great to see you. Appreciate your time and those picks, sir. .Have a great weekend. .You too.

86,2025-05-23 20:41:00,Home Depot Vs Floor & Decor: Which Retail Stock Stands Taller?,"HD leverages scale and tech while FND grows with focus and agility, two distinct strategies vying for a share in the $1-trillion home improvement retail market.","In the dynamic world of home improvement retail, two powerful players are vying for dominance, but with very different playbooks. The Home Depot Inc. HD, the industry’s undisputed heavyweight, commands the market with unmatched scale, an expansive product mix and a deeply entrenched national presence. Floor & Decor FND is a fast-moving challenger making waves with its focused, high-growth approach to hard surface flooring.While Home Depot commands the lion’s share of the market with its vast scale and legacy strength, Floor & Decor is swiftly gaining ground, leveraging its niche expertise and focused business model, and expanding its footprint to outperform expectations. As HD doubles down on breadth and infrastructure, FND is winning with precision and agility.As consumer preferences evolve and housing trends shift, the question looms large: Can specialization outpace scale? This face-off explores how the titans of scale and specialization are battling for market share and what it means for investors and the $1-trillion home improvement industry..Home Depot is a behemoth. With $39.9 billion in first-quarter fiscal 2025 sales, more than 2,350 stores, and a 25% share of the U.S. home improvement market, HD operates across nearly every product category. Its market dominance spans both DIY and Pro segments, offering unmatched breadth and logistics. In contrast, Floor & Decor’s market share is a fraction of HD’s share, but its narrow focus on hard surface flooring — tiles, wood, stone and laminates — has positioned it as a category killer. With aggressive store expansion and high-single-digit comp growth, FND is punching well above its weight.When comparing market share and key financial statistics, Home Depot maintains a clear and commanding lead over Floor & Decor in the U.S. home improvement landscape..Home Depot’s business strategy is anchored in its unmatched scale, expansive product assortment and seamless omnichannel integration. Serving both DIY consumers and professional contractors, HD leverages a vast store network and robust service offerings. This includes the company’s evolving Pro ecosystem, which has been significantly strengthened by the acquisition of SRS Distribution. The Home Depot brand is deeply associated with value, reliability and expertise, and continues to set the standard for in-store service and category leadership across all segments of the home improvement industry.As it evolves into a truly interconnected retail powerhouse, Home Depot is bridging the physical and digital with remarkable efficiency. Its AI-powered tool, Magic Apron, brings the in-store associate experience online, contributing to an 8% increase in digital sales in first-quarter fiscal 2025.Customers benefit from fast, flexible delivery, seamless order pickup, and tailored support whether shopping on mobile, desktop or in-store. For associates, tools like Pocket Guide and emerging generative AI capabilities deliver real-time access to product knowledge and operational insights, fueling better customer engagement and higher conversion rates.Financially, HD remains a model of consistency and shareholder value. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, the company delivered a 31.3% return on invested capital (ROIC), distributed $2.3 billion in dividends and continued its steady pace of capital investment to drive growth. With an estimated $50 billion in deferred home improvement demand still untapped, Home Depot is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the next wave of renovation and remodeling activity, especially as interest rates normalize and macroeconomic confidence rebounds.Moreover, HD is strategically equipped to navigate global trade volatility and tariff pressure. More than 50% of its purchases are sourced domestically, and the company is aggressively diversifying its international supply base, ensuring that no single foreign country accounts for more than 10% of its sourcing. This sourcing agility, combined with HD’s scale and deep vendor relationships, enables the company to maintain pricing stability and protect margins.Instead of passing costs on to consumers, HD is optimizing product assortments, driving productivity gains and using a portfolio-based approach to offset inflationary impacts, widening its competitive pricing edge in the marketplace.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-vs-floor-decor-124100877.html,"```json

Quote, ""I'll be watching,"" the president told Walmart after CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call that even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices. Despite being known for their everyday low prices, Walmart is expecting the hikes to begin rolling out later this month. President Trump's tariffs equally impacting the automakers. Ford pulling its full-year guidance as they expect tariffs could have significant impact on the company bottom line. The auto giant also raising prices on three of its Mexico-produced models. The Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pickup, and the Bronco Sport will increase by as much as $2,000. It's not just retailers and autos seeing the impact here. Big tech feeling the pain as well.

88,2025-05-23 19:00:00,Walmart got an angry message from Trump on tariffs. Then Home Depot and Target downplayed them,America’s highest-profile retail chains are walking a difficult tightrope — trying to blunt the financial hit from tariffs by raising prices for consumers without angering them or President Donald Trump.,"America’s highest-profile retail chains are walking a difficult tightrope — trying to blunt the financial hit from tariffs by raising prices for consumers without angering them or President Donald Trump..Walmart, Target and Home Depot are recent examples of how companies are struggling to navigate raising prices because of Trump’s tariffs. Companies say the trade levies will increase their costs. But Corporate America has to learn to speak a new language — one that informs shareholders and customers about the effects from tariffs while avoiding reaction from Trump on social media or a threat from him or his administration to punish or investigate a company..The three big-box chains will all take a hit from the global trade war. Around 40% of Walmart’s merchandise is imported, while roughly half of Target’s and Home Depot’s products come from overseas. The chains are all likely to change suppliers, absorb higher costs, raise prices or cut products to handle tariffs. But the similarity ends there: Despite using a similar toolbox to minimize the impact, each company has communicated about the impact of tariffs in different ways in recent quarterly earnings calls..Walmart, reporting earnings first, was outspoken about the trade war impact, saying higher tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices. That prompted a strong reaction from Trump, who said Walmart should “eat” the cost. Days later, Home Depot and Target tiptoed around price hikes from tariffs during their own earnings calls..Some companies are more willing than others to speak out and risk blowback from Trump, retail analysts say..“Companies understand that whatever they say will be heard by the administration and reacted to,” said Michael Baker, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. “Walmart, because of their size and importance to the US consumer, may have a little more leverage and credibility to take a more aggressive posture. It makes sense for other companies to keep a little bit of a lower profile.”.Price decisions are highly sensitive. Mistakes can break a company’s reputation with consumers or crush their business. Companies are also struggling to make price decisions with tariff rates in constant flux..But the White House has been on the attack over those decisions. Trump first took aim at Amazon last month following a report that it was considering displaying the added costs of tariffs on some items. Trump escalated it by placing an angry call to founder and Trump donor Jeff Bezos..Trump then threatened toymaker Mattel with a 100% tariff after its CEO warned that tariffs would increase toy prices in the US.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-got-angry-message-trump-110050426.html,"```json

Sales at building materials and garden supply retailers rose 0.8% last month from March, the biggest gain since 2022, and were up 3.2% from April last year.  The trend comes even as prices for home improvement products have been rising.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S. homeowners are spending more on home renovation projects, bucking a broader pullback by consumers amid diminished confidence in the economy..Sales at building materials and garden supply retailers rose 0.8% last month from March, the biggest gain since 2022, and were up 3.2% from April last year. At the same time, U.S. retail sales overall rose 0.1%, a sharp slowdown from March..The trend comes even as prices for home improvement products have been rising..The cost of home repairs and remodeling climbed by nearly 4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Verisk’s Remodel Index. The strategic data analytics firm tracks costs for more than 10,000 home repair items, from appliances to windows..Recent price increases appear to be driven primarily by labor costs and don't appear to reflect the ongoing trade war that the Trump administration is engaged in with major U.S. trading partners like Mexico, China and Canada..“We haven’t seen panic buying from contractors or investors concerned about the impact tariffs might have on future costs, or labor rates being driven up by stricter enforcement of immigration policies,"" Greg Pyne, vice president of pricing for Verisk Property Estimating Solutions, said in a report earlier this month..Home Depot said Tuesday that it doesn’t expect to raise prices because of tariffs, saying it has spent years diversifying the sources for the goods on its shelves. However, executive Billy Bastek said some products now on Home Depot shelves may disappear..He also noted that the chain is seeing fewer customers taking on large home improvement jobs like kitchen and bath remodels, because high interest rates may be dissuading homeowners from borrowing money to finance such projects..Spending on home renovations has remained resilient as elevated mortgage rates and skyrocketing home prices have frozen out many would-be buyers. That's kept U.S. home sales in a slump, limiting the market for homeowners who want to sell..Many homeowners also bought or refinanced their mortgage when the average rate on a 30-year home loan was below 3% or 4% in the first couple of years of the pandemic.

Home Depot's profit margins are higher than many competitors.  Walmart said last week that it would need to raise some prices, but it provided a broad outline of how it would seek to minimize the price hikes through redistributing its import bases, reworking packaging, and other actions.","Home Depot reported a mixed first quarter, with EPS that came in below expectations..Management said that it would not raise prices because of tariffs..Home Depot's profit margins are higher than many competitors..10 stocks we like better than Home Depot ›.Will they or won't they? That's the question on investors' and shoppers' minds alike as retailers start outlining their strategies to deal with tariffs. Walmart said last week that it would need to raise some prices, but it provided a broad outline of how it would seek to minimize the price hikes through redistributing its import bases, reworking packaging, and other actions..Home Depot (NYSE: HD), on the other hand, told investors during its first-quarter earnings report that it wouldn't raise prices. That was welcome news, considering all the other problems the company is having today..Let's take a deeper look at what's going on..Home Depot is a perennial winner and market beater, but it's experiencing strong external pressure from a variety of interconnected sources. The real estate industry is struggling through continued high interest and mortgage rates, leading to lower sales in the home improvement sector, and inflation is making it harder for customers to spend on anything extra. Home improvement is often a gray zone between essentials and discretionary spending..As the leader in the industry, Home Depot benefits from spending on what consumers can't avoid, but it feels the pinch in other categories..""People are painting again and working in their yards and doing smaller projects, but just have not engaged in the larger projects,"" CEO Ted Decker said during the first-quarter earnings call..The 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended May 4) was mixed, but in line with expectations. Sales increased 9.4% year over year, but comparable sales (comps) were down 0.3%. That means the growth is coming from new stores, of which there were three in the first quarter, and acquisitions, like SRS Distribution, which Home Depot purchased last year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $3.56, down from $3.67 last year and $0.04 below analyst expectations..Decker said that 50% of the company's merchandise is sourced in the U.S., and over the past few years, it's diversified its supply base so it's not reliant on any one country. He said that within the next 12 months, it will reach a level that no country outside the U.S. will be responsible for more than 10% of its purchases.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-tariffs-home-depot-says-082500459.html,"```json

(NYSE:HD) shares on May 21..After stronger Q1 2025 results, the analyst became more confident that the company would achieve its guidance for 2025, especially after the management mentioned that the sales momentum from the last two months continued in the second quarter. Management also noted that the worst is behind regarding economic headwinds, and they do not expect broad price increases from tariffs..The company’s better-than-expected comparable sales and growing online sales encouraged the analyst. Home Depot reported Q1 2025 sales of $39.9 billion (+9.4% year-over-year), which matched expectations, but adjusted EPS of $3.56 modestly missed consensus. Comparable sales in the quarter decreased 0.3%..On a positive note, Home Depot reiterated its guidance of total sales growth of around 2.8% and comparable sales growth of around 1%, indicating consumer spending is still holding up well. However, consumers are deferring larger projects as interest rates remain high and prefer taking up smaller projects. The company also expects that, within a year, no country outside the United States will account for over 10% of its total purchases, thus diversifying its supply chain..Overall, the analyst believes that Home Depot has several levers, such as pricing, inventory, and supply chain management, which should support earnings growth. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating..The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a home improvement retailer that offers a wide range of building materials, home improvement, lawn, and garden products, DIY ideas, installation, repair, and other services..While we acknowledge the potential of HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

It's close, according to Morgan Stanley, which isn't looking for big gains in either case..The bank's analysts this week reiterated ""overweight"" ratings on both companies' shares, restating price targets that imply slightly greater upside for Lowe’s—$255, suggesting an 8.8% rise—than for Home Depot at $410, representing a 7.7% premium. (Those moves are based on each stock’s closing prices on Monday and last Friday, respectively, shortly before the companies reported earnings this week.).The analysts said Lowe’s was “well managed” and that Home Depot’s performance has been improving since March..Dramatic improvements aren’t expected in the near term because “large remodeling projects remain anemic,” Morgan Stanley said, referring to a drop-off in major DIY projects because of relatively high interest rates and sluggish home sales..Shares of both companies fell more than 1% Thursday as broader markets moved modestly after a drab Wednesday.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter. .Lowe’s and The Home Depot credited their AI projects for better customer and employee experiences as the home improvement retailers expanded access to tools over the past months. .The enhancements come after sustained investment in AI and digital transformation from both companies. Lowe’s was among the initial wave of companies signing up for ChatGPT Enterprise in 2023, following several years of work to mature its IT systems and architecture. Home Depot was also an early adopter with nearly 200 traditional and generative AI pilots across the organization in the first half of 2024. .Retailers have generally prioritized AI use cases that boost employee productivity and improve customer experience, loss prevention and operations. As in other industries, retail companies often run into implementation challenges, from a dearth of customer trust to the time and resources needed to train workers, according to a February Everseen report..Home Depot has worked to address the latter roadblock. Last year, the company’s EVP and CIO Fahim Siddiqui said his organization worked to build AI awareness throughout Home Depot’s workforce to enable safe use. .The company rolled out generative AI tools this past quarter to ease information gathering for associates. The tools tap into internal Home Depot data to provide operational and product knowledge.  .“These tools, coupled with a multitude of other investments to drive better service, on-shelf availability and better insights into our customers' projects, help us win with all of our customers, DIYs and Pros,” Ann-Marie Campbell, senior EVP of U.S. stores and operations, The Home Depot Canada, The Home Depot Mexico and outside sales and service, said during the retailer’s Q1 2025 earnings call Tuesday. .Lowe’s has prioritized the intersection of customer service and employee experience, too..Associates across the retail chain’s 1,700-plus stores gained access to an internal AI assistant this month.

(NYSE:HD), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$40b and statutory earnings per share of US$3.45 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Home Depot is executing in line with expectations. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Home Depot after the latest results..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..Following last week's earnings report, Home Depot's 37 analysts are forecasting 2026 revenues to be US$163.9b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$14.66, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$163.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$14.61 in 2026. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.. Check out our latest analysis for Home Depot .The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$420, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Home Depot, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$484 and the most bearish at US$297 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable..Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Home Depot's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 4.9% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.0% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Home Depot is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-inc-nyse-hd-124959783.html,"```json

This comes after rival Home Depot's mixed earnings results with more on what this means for the home improvement market. Let's get to Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma, Brooke. .Good afternoon to you both. Certainly, what we heard from both retailers is that that discretionary DIY demand is still not as strong as what it used to be, and consumers are taking on less big projects. We also heard there was a slow start to the spring season because of this poor weather in February. And all in the background, we have those ongoing challenges around the housing market, as well as higher mortgage rates. They're persisting higher interest rates are persisting that are putting off large projects, and this uncertainty around tariffs are certainly lingering. One source telling me, quote, ""We see positive takeaways from both earnings reports, but we are not fully recovered just yet."" And if we take a closer look at same-store sales growth, you see this reverse this past quarter from both Lowe's and Home Depot after a positive uptick in Q4. Now, Lowe's main Lowe's main business is here in the US, its whole business. We did see same-store sales fall there. Home Depot also saw same-store sales growth fall as well. But keep in mind, Home Depot also has this mega Canada, Mexico, as well as US business. And here in the US, it did see a slight uptick. Something to watch out for though here is CFO Brandon Sink, uh, that is of Lowe's. He did say on the call this morning that the chain has yet to see those shoppers re-engage in that discretionary categories, but he said, ""Hey, trends aren't getting worse, we're seeing a lot of the same here."" .Um, and what about the messaging around tariffs? Because, as we just heard from, uh, Ben Warshaw, you know, that's now has some political overtones as well. .Right, many retailers touch and go on if they should say that they're going to raise prices here. And so what we heard today from Lowe's, they said that roughly 60% of sales originate here in the US. They also said that if, hey, something doesn't make sense to have on the shelf anymore, they will go to eliminate that product. We heard the same thing from Home Depot yesterday. And they also said that they're seeking to limit their exposure to China here. A far similar tone to what we heard from Home Depot. So, these home improvement retailers sharing a similar tone when it comes to tariffs. What we heard, uh, on Tuesday from Home Depot was that more than 50% of purchases are sourced in the US. They also said something interesting here. They said that in 12 months, no single country outside of the US will represent more than 10% of their purchases. So really thinking strategically about their supply chain here, Home Depot came up front and center and they said they have no plans to raise prices. Of course, after that major pushback from the president that we saw over the weekend when it comes to Walmart. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/home-depot-vs-lowes-two-203356914.html,"```json

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently..On Tuesday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, broke down the day’s market movements as he pointed to rising bond yields as the main force behind a series of notable shifts in stock performance..“Every day around here, we have a referendum on stocks, and you can’t let it get you down because tomorrow’s vote can always be different from today’s… Why is it like this?… Well, the answer is a mischievous one.”.READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Recent Thoughts on These 15 Stocks and Jim Cramer Put These 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight.Cramer offered a broader perspective and explained that on most days, individual stocks respond either to the movements of other stocks or to the overall direction of the market. He said that the market, in turn, often takes its cues from the bond market, which he described as its “much larger sibling.”.On Tuesday, he noted that the bond market heavily influenced stock prices. He highlighted that every downward movement in bond prices, which translates to higher interest rates, was met with negative reactions from the stock market. According to Cramer, such a relationship meant that rising rates handed the advantage to the market bears and tipped the scales in their favor during daily trading..“So here’s the bottom line: The good news is that rates can also go up and not just down by the time we get a budget deal. The bad news is that rates are threatening to break out to the upside. And if they can’t stay calm, if they jump to a new, higher level while Congress works on the budget bill, we’re liable to have more days like today, where you need a plethora of positive themes for any given stock to break free from the gravitational pull of these darn miserable Treasurys.”.For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on May 20. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds..Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-home-depot-hd-181334222.html,"```json

More importantly, it is “driving our increased conviction in the revenue acceleration underpinning our FY26E-FY27E.”.Stifel now sees Home Depot’s outlook as “largely derisked from the timing,” which it says helps “shift the narrative away from trepidation around ongoing negative revisions.”.The firm concluded that Home Depot is well-positioned to outperform as demand rebounds. “We believe the FY25 performance will drive enthusiasm for HD’s ability to disproportionately capitalize on a likely above trend-line home improvement category recovery.”.Related articles.Home Depot raised to Buy at Stifel after Q1 earnings release.Bernstein issues a warning on U.S. auto stocks: The downgrade cycle isn’t over.RBC downgrades CAE to Sector Perform, cites full valuation and fewer catalysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-raised-buy-stifel-131342034.html,"```json

The slowdown in home sales is wrecking demand from the very top of the funnel, all the way down to retail chains.","If Home Depot (HD) raised eyebrows with its muted earnings Tuesday, Lowe’s confirmed the trend Wednesday. The slowdown in home sales is wrecking demand from the very top of the funnel, all the way down to retail chains..Lowe’s, releasing results early Wednesday morning, reported Q1 earnings per share of $2.92, edging past expectations but only thanks to a tight grip on costs. Sales fell to $20.9 billion, down from $21.4 billion a year ago. Comparable sales dropped 1.7%, with execs blaming early spring weather, though Pro and e-commerce channels eked out mid-single-digit growth..Just don’t mistake this beat for momentum. Lowe’s, which operates a mind-boggling 200 million square feet of retail space, reaffirmed its cautious full-year outlook, projecting flat to 1% comp sales growth and earnings between $12.15 and $12.40. That’s far from bullish guidance in what should be peak home improvement season..With mortgage rates stuck around 7% and median home prices hovering above $400,000, new buyers are priced out, and existing homeowners aren’t selling, keen to hang onto their 3% loans. That means fewer kitchen renos, fewer appliance upgrades, and way more mulch-and-paint maintenance. Home Depot confirmed all this Tuesday with a 0.3% drop in overall comps and U.S. store sales that lagged inflation..Together, Lowe’s and Home Depot paint a clear macro picture that big-ticket home improvement is stalling. Shoppers are holding back. In other words, the housing chill is real. And it’s spreading..The U.S.’s tentative China trade deal only buys 90 days of relative calm. Consumer confidence is sliding, resumed student loan repayments are biting, and higher-income shoppers — once the cushion in slowdowns — are trading down fast. Target (TGT), also on Wednesday morning, joined the list of beloved American brands waving the yellow flag..In this environment, “better than expected” just means not falling apart yet, as Lowe’s stock price demonstrates this morning, rising 2% in premarket trading. That’s because for housing-linked retail right now, the ceiling is low — and it turns out the floors may need some work, too..For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowes-beats-wall-street-earnings-124650120.html,"```json

Revenue fell 2% year over year to $20.93 billion, while adjusted earnings per share dropped 4.6% to $2.92, compared to the $2.88 expected..The results ""reflect ongoing pressure in DIY bigger ticket discretionary demand"" and a ""slower start to spring"" due to poor February weather, Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said on the earnings call. He added the company contends with ""significant macro uncertainty"" and ""ongoing challenges in the housing market."".Same-store sales fell 1.7%, better than the 2.04% decline expected. That's a reversal after same-store sales growth turned positive in Q4 for the first time in roughly two years.

Total sales are projected to be $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, while same-store sales are expected to be flat to up 1% year over year..Tariff uncertainty remains a top concern.

According to Zillow Z, late summer can offer better deals, as sellers may start lowering prices before the fall..However, while the summer is often the busiest time for homebuilders as well, high demand can drive up material costs. Of course, higher tariffs will also have an adverse effect in regard to rising material costs..This makes it a worthy topic, of which housing and construction-related stocks are worthy of investors' consideration as the summer approaches.. .Optimistically, Home Depot should be able to avoid a significant impact from tariffs, highlighting in its Q1 report that more than 50% of the company’s supply purchases are sourced from the United States. Having a favorable global sourcing strategy, Home Depot’s Q1 sales were up 9% year over year to $39.85 billion and topped estimates of $39.4 billion..That said, Q1 EPS of $3.56 dipped from $3.63 in the prior period and missed expectations of $3.59 per share. Still, Home Depot reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 guidance, expecting total sales growth of approximately 2.8%, which is roughly in line with Zacks' estimates (Current Year below). Based on Zacks' projections, Home Depot’s total sales are forecasted to rise another 4% in FY26 to $171.4 billion..Home Depot stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and should remain a viable long-term investment going into the peak home improvement season, although better buying opportunities could still be ahead following the Q1 earnings miss..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .Notably, Zillow’s latest home value and sales report from April suggests a mix of growth and challenges in the housing market. Zillow’s latest forecast calls for home values to decrease by 1.9% this year from previous estimates of -0.6%, although existing home sales are expected to increase 3.3% to 4.2 million in 2025..Newly pending listing sales in April fell 2.5% from a year ago, despite lower average mortgage rates. New home listings did rise 7.6%, with Zillow stating sellers are more enthusiastic. Unfortunately, Zillow stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) based on a trend of declining earnings estimate revisions (EPS) over the last 60 days. Also, the volatility in mortgage rates will be something to keep an eye on, with Zillow expecting the average fixed 30-year rate to settle near 6.5% by year-end.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-construction-related-stocks-surge-233000611.html,"```json

By 2026, no single non-U.S. country will account for more than 10% of imports, he said. McPhail added the company intends to maintain current price levels to gain market share even as peers, such as Walmart, raise prices..The $18.25 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution helped push total Q1 sales up about 9% year over year, with $2.6 billion of that growth attributed to the SRS business. Comparable sales companywide declined 0.3%, but monthly data showed improvement: down 3.3% in February, up 1.3% in March, and up 1.8% in April. McPhail cited poor weather in February as a key drag..Spring sales showed strength in appliance, garden, plumbing, and electrical categories. However, big-ticket items like kitchen countertops and bath products remained soft due to high interest rates and consumer caution. CEO Ted Decker said the macro backdrop, especially elevated mortgage rates, has led customers to delay large projects..Roughly 80% of Home Depot's customers are homeowners, a segment McPhail described as resilient. The average transaction size in Q1 was $90.71, in line with the prior year..Despite the seasonal lift, shares of Home Depot are down 2% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's roughly 1% gain.

Moreover, the firm believes that sustaining guidance and indicating positive trends may be sufficient to push the shares back toward the $400 mark..Although the stock has seen a 2% drop since the year began, Evercore believes that reiterating guidance and emphasizing potential gains in comparable sales over the course of the year could improve HD's performance. This is particularly true given that Home Depot is putting itself in a position to profit from a future housing market recovery by continuing to invest in technology, customer service, and the opening of new stores. In a note, the analysts stated:.""HD remains a benchmark retailer, investing in technology, multichannel and stores, even while current demand remains depressed. With hopes rising for an improving Home Improvement market in 2025, we think investors would be well served by having real exposure to the turn."".While we acknowledge the potential of HD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.  If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock..Read Next:10 Best Stocks to Buy According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and 8 Best Vanguard Funds to Invest In for Retirees..Disclosure: None.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-earnings-preview-evercore-200612549.html,"```json

Wall Street analysts say the volatility reflects a shift in investor sentiment as recent optimism around trade developments gives way to renewed concern over the nation’s ballooning debt..While markets initially brushed off the downgrade, analysts warn the bond market isn't out of the woods yet as fiscal uncertainty and persistent inflation pressures will likely fuel further turbulence in long-run Treasurys..Citi analysts noted that fiscal space is narrowing, meaning the government has less leeway to increase spending without worsening its debt outlook, due to reduced tariff revenues. At the same time, the potential for a major fiscal impulse is growing under President Trump’s proposed ""Big Beautiful Bill."".Trump’s tax proposal, still in its early stages in Congress, calls for sweeping cuts to individual and corporate tax rates, which would raise the nation's debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

Since then, market sentiment has taken a U-turn, and a large tech rally, including in some more speculative names, has helped lead the market's return..""We may be at that point where the setup, from a sentiment perspective, suggests that the market could have some downside if we get a negative catalyst,"" Sonders said. ""And that's really the best way to think about this market. It's hard to judge it based on what policy announcements are going to be and when they're going to come. That's a fool's errand."".Trump's tariff walkback has been at the forefront of the recent surge in stocks. Last week, the 90-day tariff pause between the US and China prompted several Wall Street strategists to boost their year-end targets for the S&P 500 in 2025 while economists scaled back their probabilities of a recession for the US economy..Still, consumer sentiment surveys remain at their lowest levels on record, and fears that tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth haven't fully left the picture..""Equity markets have reacted with unwarranted optimism, overlooking the persistent economic drag posed by elevated tariffs,"" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients..Daco lowered his odds of a US recession in the next 12 months to 35% from a prior projection of 45% prior to the delay of tariffs on China. Still, he sees US economic growth approaching ""stall speed"" by the fourth quarter, with GDP rising just 0.6% compared to the year prior in the final three months of 2025..""While the near-term outlook is more constructive, risks remain tilted to the downside,"" Daco said..With the S&P 500 just 3% from notching a new record close, a slew of individual stocks are already hitting new highs..Uber (UBER) joined that list on Monday and extended further to new highs on Tuesday.

However, he expressed uncertainty about whether that trend will hold, as he mentioned that the tech sector has been relatively quiet in terms of news, aside from a keynote from Jensen Huang. Looking ahead, Cramer noted that more retail earnings are expected this week..“But here’s the bottom line: Unless we get news of new hostilities in the trade war with China, I think this market’s propensity will still be to go higher, even though we are overbought. And even with this late-night credit rating downgrade of the US debt, which is very quizzical to me, I think we’re containing the downside of the economy, and that means no recession, which tells me the negativity may be out of sync with the reality. That’s often the best kind of market…”.For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on May 16.

Over the past five years, Home Depot has reduced its share count by more than 7%..The market's up-and-down reaction to the quarter seems fitting. In one sense, Home Depot can do little but accept mediocre growth until the macro environment changes.

So far, that hasn’t happened..Many housing-market experts figured 2025 would be marked by demand for renovations. High home prices and mortgage rates might weigh on sales, the story went, but that also meant people had plenty of home equity against which to borrow—and good reason to improve the places they’d already bought..Executives at Home Depot (HD) aren’t seeing that so far, they said today, citing economic uncertainty that has people holding back on those projects amid a stubborn housing market and an unusually downbeat selling season..“People are painting again and working in their yards and doing smaller projects but just have not engaged in the larger projects,” CEO Ted Decker said on a conference call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. (The company earlier today reported first-quarter sales that were better than expected and said it aimed to keep its pricing stable in a fast-moving trade environment.).Home Depot estimates that there’s a cumulative shortfall of about $50 billion in home-improvement spending, and Decker expects things to pick up. More color on this could land tomorrow, when competitor Lowe's Cos.

The next years could potentially see Home Depot addressing these concerns, particularly if its forecasted 3.7% annual revenue growth sustains investor confidence..The recent operational and financial steps may impact earnings forecasts, especially in light of a US$423.65 analyst price target, which is 15.2% above the current share price of US$359.38. This indicates that analysts see significant upside potential. Still, achieving these targets would require overcoming factors like high interest rates and market constraints. As Home Depot seeks to enhance its growth trajectory, the balancing of these elements will be crucial for future performance considerations..Unlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Home Depot stock in this financial health report.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-nyse-hd-reports-174421648.html,"```json

What are some of the things that you'll be watching, you know, in the next several weeks, several months throughout the summer to kind of get a feel that that guidance is tracking? .Sure. Well, we have a number of leading indicators that we track on an inter quarter basis and, and publish frequently. This is things like overall retail sales. We spend a lot of time looking at their vendors, a lot of their publicly traded vendors report a month before Home Depot does because they have a December year end, whereas uh, Home Depot has a January year end. So we hear from Stanley Black & Decker, Masco, et cetera. That gives us good insight. We do get weekly uh, point of sales data. So there's a lot of stuff that we track and we, and we publish on and that really does help us get a sense as to whether uh, they're tracking in line or not and if we see things waver, uh, we'll adjust accordingly. .And, and Michael, I also want to look ahead to some of the other retail earnings that we have coming up, particularly when it comes to a company like Costco. How are you thinking about that retailer in this moment? .Well, Costco is doing exceptionally well. We know that. Uh, remember Costco is the only retailer still that still gives us monthly comps. So we have a very good sense as to how they're comping uh, into quarters. So, so when they report it, it's really about margins. Uh, but when we look at the, the, the, the monthly comps, uh, they're just taking a lot of share. Uh, really all the clubs are doing well. Sam's Club within the Walmart um, uh, uh, report last week was very strong. BJ's has been taking market share. Uh, in fact, BJ's has been one of the best performing stocks in, in our space year to date. BJ's stock is up more than Costco's. Uh, but all three of them are doing very well that the club space in general just taking market share uh, in an environment where consumers are, are really focused on value. .And I guess I wonder if you can kind of put a bow on all of this for me here, especially as we head towards Target earnings. How are we going to see retailers sort of entering either the Walmart camp of admitting to raising prices versus the Home Depot camp of saying we're going to keep prices where they are and what are the factors that you think different retailers are going to consider as they're deciding which camp to signal that they're going to be in to investors. .Well, well, it's very tricky and you're right, to me it's much more about signaling. I don't really think those two companies, Home Depot and Walmart, are doing things that much differently. It's just how it's articulated. Uh, I think Walmart wants to send a, a message uh, perhaps to the administration that, you know, some prices will go up uh, and, and, and so uh, try to help with the tariff negotiations, if you will, telling the administration that we really need some help on, on tariffs. But again, I, Walmart also use a portfolio effect and in some areas prices will go up, some, some will go down and I think it'll be about neutral. Uh, but, but really it's just about how much you want to sort of signal to the administration and, and Home Depot just seems to be taking a, a more conservative approach to that, uh, Walmart a little bit more aggressive. How other companies do it? You know, Walmart really has the size, the scale, the credibility, whatever you want to call it to, to, to, to, to really articulate that a little bit more effectively than, than I think some smaller retailers. That being said, smaller retailers, they might not have a choice. They might have to raise prices because they don't really have the offsets that the bigger retailers with scale have, i.e. pushing some of the uh, tariffs back onto their suppliers.

Net earnings per share declined 3% to $3.56, missing the $3.59 expected..Same-store sales fell 0.3%, compared to the 0.2% decrease expected.

But tariffs may cause Home Depot to increase prices on select items and eliminate some product lines entirely..“We don’t see broad based price increases for our customers at all going forward,” Home Depot executive Billy Bastek said on an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. “There are items that we have that could potentially be impacted from a tariff that, candidly, we won’t have going forward.”.Home Depot said it has diversified where it sources its merchandise and reduced its reliance on China. More than half of Home Depot’s products come from the United States. The company is betting that holding prices down will help it gain market share against competitors, Bastek said..But the trade war has begun to hurt Home Depot. Consumer sentiment has plunged near record lows as Americans fear tariffs will reignite inflation and weaken the economy. That, in part, kept some customers away from the home improvement behemoth..Home Depot reported sluggish earnings, weighed down by a weak housing market and consumers taking on fewer large-scale renovation projects. Sales at US stores open for at least one year increased 0.2% last quarter..A wave of companies have announced price hikes because of the added costs of tariffs..Many of Home Depot’s competitors and suppliers have been raising prices to mitigate cost increases from the 10% universal tariffs on every product entering the United States and higher levies on Chinese goods. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement to lower those tariffs last week, but the United States still charges a 30% levy on most goods coming from China..Home Depot has also caught a break so far on lumber tariffs, a major part of its business. But that could change soon. About 30% of the softwood lumber consumed in the US is imported, with Canada accounting for north of 80% of those imports. Lumber is expected to soon face a tariff hike..In April, Stanley Black & Decker, the owner of Dewalt, Craftsman, Black + Decker and other power tool brands, raised prices by an average of high single-digits because of tariffs. It plans to introduce a second round of increases later in the year, the company said on an earnings call..Walmart said Trump’s tariffs are “too high” and it will raise prices on some items as Trump’s global trade war increases the company’s costs..“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said last week on an earnings call.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-plans-keep-prices-114256725.html,"```json

The split in strategy comes as companies scramble to respond to President Trump’s shifting trade policies and a temporary deal that dropped tariffs to 30% on Chinese imports and 10% for many other countries. However, depending on the exact import, tariffs may stack up beyond those headline numbers..Home Depot, which missed Wall Street’s Q1 earnings expectations but beat on revenue, says it’s hedged its exposure by diversifying sourcing. McPhail asserted that more than half the company’s products are U.S.-made and that no single country outside the U.S. will account for more than 10% of purchases by next year..Still, comparable sales in Q1 declined 0.3% company-wide, with only a 0.2% gain in the U.S., meaning most of the growth came from new store openings and newer business lines, not increased spending. Customers appear to be trading down to smaller jobs, skipping bigger home-reno projects..While Home Depot says it clawed back momentum in April, its usual spring bump may be masking weak demand and consumer caution. By holding prices steady, it hopes to win goodwill, wooing customers wary of inflation, whatever its underlying cause..While Home Depot says it intends to hold the line, some of its major suppliers have already indicated price hikes could be coming. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), which supplies power tools and hardware to Home Depot and other retailers, recently told investors it will raise prices in the second and third quarters, explicitly citing higher import costs tied to Trump’s new tariffs..Since the temporary China trade deal was struck, Black & Decker’s tariff concerns may be fading somewhat. But the threat still looms..That creates a squeeze because Home Depot, no matter its sourcing, still doesn’t make the bulk of what it sells. If wholesale prices rise as expected and Home Depot refuses to pass those increases on to customers, the pressure lands squarely on its own margins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-says-wont-raise-134425910.html,"```json

Same-store sales declined by 0.3%, more than the 0.2% loss that was expected..Yahoo Finance senior retail reporter Brooke DiPalma breaks down the home improvement retailer's reaffirmed 2025 guidance and how it sees itself navigating the Trump administration's tariff policies..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..Well Home Depot reporting mixed first quarter results, revenue topping estimates up more than 9% from a year ago, but earnings falling short of expectations. Still the home improvement retailer reaffirming its full year forecast. Yahoo finances Brook DePalma here with the biggest takeaways from the earnings report, Brook. What are you looking at? .Good morning. Well certainly Home Depot reported this mixed quarter, but investors are saying this was actually better than what they had ultimately feared here. The company also reiterating how it plans to handle Trump tariffs. Wall Street also impressed with that. Taking closer look at the numbers here. That mixed earnings report did come in at revenue beating Wall Streets expectations. Just earnings per share coming in slightly lower. Now executives said that these results were in line with what they had expected, but they did see customers engage less around larger projects and ultimately, uh they also saw customers engage with smaller projects rather. Taking closer look at same source sales growth after eight consecutive quarters of negative sales growth. Back in Q4 the company posted positive same source sales growth. Now this quarter in Q1 we're seeing that reverse. We're seeing that turn negative. The company ultimately alluding that to negative weather, ultimately TD Cowen saying in a note that they were encouraged once again by that better than feared same source sales decline. Also, the company reiterated full year guidance providing some optimism to the street here. Now many on the street are also thinking that hey, Home Depot is actually well positioned to handle to handle President Trump's tariffs here. Some key takeaways that we're hearing on the call right now from Home Depot this morning is that more than 50% of purchases are sourced from here in the US. They also said that in 12 months no single country outside of the US will represent more than 10% of their purchases. And the key factor here somewhat different than what we heard from Walmart last week is that they have no plans to increase prices because of President Trump's tariffs. That's certainly providing optimism here on the street. .Yeah, Brook just about 30 seconds left, but that seems to be the sticking point when it comes to this print in terms of the analyst notes that I'm seeing crossing the wire here. How is Home Depot able to do that? What can you tell us about why they're able to not raise prices off the back of tariffs? .Well, what they're saying that they're able to do here is really work with their vendors, saying that they have a strong relationship with their suppliers and they're really able to mitigate the costs when it comes to that. Ultimately though they did say that they still saw inflation when it comes to lumber. Of course we know lumber mostly comes from Canada. That's you know, in negotiations right now. So it's sort of a wait and see, but they're saying here they have no plans to raise prices this year. Of course so much up in the air still when it comes to tariffs. .Yeah, and so interesting to hear them couple that with keeping their guidance as well. Brook thank you so much. Really appreciate you.

On Tuesday, Home Depot posted Q1 sales rising 9% year-over-year to total nearly $40 billion. However, comparable sales – what existing stores actually brought in – fell 0.3% overall, with only a tiny 0.2% bump in the U.S.","On the surface, the picture looks bright – but dig a little deeper and you’ll uncover warning signs. On Tuesday, Home Depot posted Q1 sales rising 9% year-over-year to total nearly $40 billion. However, comparable sales – what existing stores actually brought in – fell 0.3% overall, with only a tiny 0.2% bump in the U.S..Compare that to inflation, which topped 3% for the same period, and you’ll see Home Depot store sales essentially fell instead of growing. Store traffic and real spending power effectively declined..Home Depot is effectively selling less volume. That’s a classic sign of consumer pullback..CEO Ted Decker’s commentary subtly acknowledged these dynamics. He praised “continued customer engagement across smaller projects,” which is another way of saying big-ticket spending went soft. Think mulch and paint season, not kitchen gut jobs. Decker also pointed to spring events as a driver, suggesting the quarter relied on typical seasonal boosts, not an uptick in spending..So why are customers holding back? The problem appears to lie with an even bigger-ticket item than a new dishwasher or dining-room light fixture: Houses..As usual, Home Depot’s results reflect the broader housing picture. Mortgage rates have shot back to 7%, chilling homebuying activity just as peak season begins. In March, the median existing-home price once again circled $400,000, while sales fell nearly 6% year-over-year according to the National Association of Realtors. April numbers are due this Thursday, but early signs point to continued malaise..When home sales stall, so does demand for major renovations and furniture overhauls. It’s no wonder Home Depot’s earnings mix shows consumers opting for DIY touch-ups, not full-blown upgrades. Until affordability returns to the housing market, that trend is unlikely to change..The bigger question now is whether Home Depot’s pain is a blip or a longer-term reset. With Lowe’s reporting Wednesday and mortgage affordability worsening, housing-linked retail is under the microscope. If consumers stay on the sidelines, “do it yourself” may give way to “don’t do it at all.”.Investors, for their part, seem to see the glass half full: Home Depot stock is rising around 2% before the bell. Maybe Wall Street expected worse, or the gloom surrounding consumer spending was already baked in. More likely, in this environment, results that are disappointing without being disastrous count as a win..For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-shows-housing-market-122200300.html,"```json

We don’t see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward.”.The Home Depot said over 50% of its purchases are sourced in the U.S., and it anticipates that a year from now, no single country outside of the U.S. will represent more than 10% of its purchases..“One of the hallmarks of Home Depot has always been diversification,” Bastek said. “A majority of our suppliers have diversified their sourcing strategies across several countries.”.Holding steady on prices stands in contrast to several other companies — including retail giant Walmart — that have said in recent weeks that price increases could be necessary if high tariffs persist..On top of tariff-related headwinds, Home Depot, like other home-related retailers, faces pressure from a slow housing market. Home sales declined 3.1% year over year in Q1, according to research from GlobalData..“This lack of recovery makes it difficult to drive home improvement spending,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “In our view, it is not until interest rates come down substantially that we will see a proper recovery in house moving activity.”.While the retailer’s customers took on smaller projects, in addition to painting and lawn work, there wasn’t much engagement in larger projects, according to Home Depot CEO Ted Decker..“Obviously we think that will increase,” Decker said, adding that “we're very much looking forward to … when people tap their equity, gain the stronger macro confidence and engage in those bigger projects.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-doesn-t-plan-120400412.html,"```json

It sources less than half of its goods outside North America, and has cut its exposure to China in recent years. CEO Ted Decker told investors that within the next 12 months, no single country outside the U.S. will represent more than 10% of its purchases..Net sales for the quarter ended May 4 came in at $39.86 billion, compared with estimates of $39.31 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. It logged adjusted profit per share of $3.56, missing expectations of $3.60..The company might be able to lean on suppliers to bear the brunt of tariffs, said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research..""But if they are committing to pass none of the incremental impact on to end consumers, then they will have to absorb the remaining tariff costs internally, which would hit margins,"" he added..The company's operating margin dipped to 12.9% for the quarter, down from 13.9% for the year-ago period..BUDGET CONSTRAINTS.Recent slowness in home improvement retail - often viewed as a bellwether for economic health - has observers watching Home Depot closely for signs of a downturn. The retailer is in its ""Super Bowl season,"" Bastek said, referring to the spring and summer months when people tend to lawns, gardens and DIY home projects..Budget constraints continue to weigh on larger home renovation activities, which Decker acknowledged on Tuesday could be a result of macroeconomic fears.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-beats-quarterly-sales-101343754.html,"```json

Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years..With $163 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Home Depot is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there are only a finite number of places to build new stores, making it harder to find incremental growth. To expand meaningfully, Home Depot likely needs to tweak its prices or enter new markets..As you can see below, Home Depot’s sales grew at a tepid 6.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) as it didn’t open many new stores..This quarter, Home Depot reported year-on-year revenue growth of 9.4%, and its $39.86 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.6%..Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last six years.

Late Monday, Subaru of America said it would raise prices on some of its most popular models by as much as $2,000..President Donald Trump lambasted Walmart, saying on social media over the weekend that the retail giant should “eat” the additional costs created by his tariffs..As Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses. Most economists are deeply skeptical of those claims and have warned that the trade penalties would worsen inflation..Tariffs on materials like lumber are also a concern for both homebuilders and home buyers. A homebuyer now needs to earn at least $114,000 a year to afford a $431,250 home -- the national median listing price in April, according to data released this month by Realtor.com.Additional housing material costs would put home ownership out of reach for more potential buyers, though Home Depot is somewhat insulated as it sources the majority of its lumber in the U.S..Early last year, the company said that about 17% of its wood is sourced from Canada. The company would not say Tuesday if those import levels have changed though after negotiations, Canadian lumber was exempted from additional 25% U.S. tariffs..During the first quarter, Home Depot’s revenue climbed as customers spent slightly more on smaller home projects..A number of U.S. companies have lowered or pulled financial guidance for investors as tariffs launched by the the Trump administration scramble world trade but on Tuesday, Home Depot stuck by earlier projections of sales growth at around 2.8%..Shares of the Atlanta company dipped slightly on Tuesday..Revenue rose to $39.86 billion from $36.42 billion a year earlier, beating the $39.3 billion that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depots-revenue-rises-first-100921147.html,"```json

Yahoo! Finance's Brooke Palmer here with what to expect from the home improvement retailer. So what do we got? .Well, Wall Street expects it's going to be a slow start to the year for Home Depot, most certainly, and that's really as two key points really weigh on consumers. That uncertainty around tariffs, and also those elevated home prices, elevated mortgage rates have really continued to create challenges around the housing market, and that's expected to have weighed on Home Depot's first quarter, certainly as potential buyers were spooked off by those higher prices. If we take a closer look at what Wall Street expects here, they still do expect revenue to grow year-over-year roughly 8% to $39.29 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected to decline year-over-year to $3.59. Now, one key area here that all Wall Street has watching is that same-store sales growth number. For eight straight quarters, we saw negative sales growth for Home Depot, and in the Q4, that number turned around. Now, more bad news is expected on the same-store sales growth front. Wall Street does expect that it did fall during this quarter down 0.2%, but experts tell me that Home Depot should be a key winner in the long term here. They say that they have this pro business that makes up about half of their customer base. We know that they recently acquired SRS distribution, that's professional business segment for roughly $18.25 billion last summer. So Wall Street optimistic that that pro business will certainly turn the tide here. .And what does Walmart's recent warning, what does that mean for Home Depot, potentially? .Right, well, two key things here is that they warned that tariffs would create higher prices. Some experts telling me that they that may have opened up the floodgates here in order for others to say, we too have to raise prices because of tariffs. In addition to that, we also know that Walmart loves to tout that they make a majority of their goods here in the U.S. Home Depot, a similar notion. They said a majority of their goods that we sell are produced in the U.S. Both Walmart and Home Depot, they both have some exposure to China here. And so really, you sort of relating those two. They might have to raise higher prices. We also know that Walmart reiterated their guidance. Could we hear similar for not just from Home Depot, but Lowe's reporting the following day and, of course, Target after that. And so Walmart perhaps might have set a precedent here on what these next earnings will look like. .All right, we'll wait and see. Brooke, thank you. Appreciate it.

But the Walmart results show that the near-term outlook for this category is unlikely to improve in any meaningful way soon. This is a net negative forTarget, which has a much bigger exposure to this category than Walmart..Target will report quarterly results before the market's open on Wednesday, May 21st. Other major retailers reporting results this week include Home Depot, Lowe's, Deckers Outdoors and others..Target shares have been big-time laggards lately, with the stock losing more than a quarter of its value this year, handily lagging the broader market (flat in the year-to-date period) and Walmart (up more than +8%)..Target is expected to report $1.68 in EPS on $24.42 billion in sales, representing year-over-year changes of -17.2% and -0.47%. Estimates for the period have been steadily on a downtrend, with today's $1.68 estimate down from $1.74 a week ago and $1.81 two months back. Same-store sales are expected to be down -1.7% this period, which would compare to +1.5% in the preceding quarter and +0.3% in the quarter before that..In addition to continued weak demand trends for Target's discretionary-heavy merchandise, these products also tend to be more trade-exposed relative to food and other traditional grocery merchandise. Walmart claims that two-thirds of its merchandise is domestically sourced, limiting its exposure to the unsettled tariff situation. Between Walmart and Target, the latter is far more vulnerable to the unfavorable global trade regime.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-home-depot-lowes-125800057.html,"```json

Home improvement spending tends to be a bellwether for broader economic health, Mathews said, because it reflects consumers’ ability to take on big projects, and can be a leading indicator of activity in the housing market.","By Nicholas P. Brown.(Reuters) - As Home Depot and Lowe’s get set to report earnings this week, April sales data from independent firms have investors gauging the likelihood of recession against the uncertainty of tariff whiplash..With homeowners tending to lawns, gardens and DIY projects as the weather warms, investors are keeping an eye not just on the home retailers' sales, but indicators about the health of the consumer..“People don’t have the savings they did during the pandemic, and they’re relying on high employment and wage growth to continue to be able to spend,” said Mark Mathews, executive director of research at the National Retail Federation..Home improvement spending tends to be a bellwether for broader economic health, Mathews said, because it reflects consumers’ ability to take on big projects, and can be a leading indicator of activity in the housing market..April credit and debit card sales were not promising. Spending at building and garden supply stores fell 2% year-over-year in April, even as every other retail category saw growth, according to May data from NRF..At Lowe’s, April sales tumbled nearly 3% year-over-year after having risen 6.6% in March, debit and credit card purchase data from Affinity Solutions revealed. Home Depot saw just a 0.7% jump after a 4.2% rise in March, according to the data..Consumers’ intention to shop at these stores in the future also fell slightly in April, according to HundredX, a company that uses surveys to gauge public sentiment about retailers..Compared to April of 2024, both stores saw about a 1% year-over-year decrease in future purchase intent. Among lower-income shoppers - those more vulnerable to economic instability - the drop was sharper, HundredX found..Home Depot and Lowe's declined to comment..It might indicate that a rebound in the stalled U.S. housing market is a ways off. “People keep baking in the assumption of a recovery, and then it keeps getting pushed out,” said Courtney Yakavonis, a senior equity analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which holds stock in both retailers. “I believe it’s going to happen eventually, but the timeline is murky.”.Others in the sector have hinted at the specter of a slowdown. Tractor Supply Co. cut its annual profit forecast in April, citing macroeconomic uncertainty..But experts interviewed by Reuters weren’t ready to forecast a recession. Wage and job growth is fairly steady, and there could be plenty of reasons for an April sales slump - including tariffs, said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz..President Donald Trump on April 2 announced sweeping tariffs on a host of trade partners, only to later pause them for 90 days. He imposed a virtual embargo on Chinese imports on April 9, but earlier this month paused those tariffs as well.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tepid-home-improvement-sales-put-100825730.html,"```json

A prolonged stall in home construction could magnify home shortages and affordability issues, economists warn.","US homebuilders pulled back on projects in April amid whipsaw tariff announcements and growing fears of economic stress, new data on Friday revealed..Single-family home starts dropped 12% in April compared to one year ago, on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to data from the US Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Housing starts measure the number of new residential construction projects that have broken ground and construction that has started..Single-family permits issued for new construction, a key indicator of future home construction, also fell 5.1% from March and were down 6.2% compared to April of last year..The drop in new home construction comes at a time when home affordability is near generational lows amid persistently elevated mortgage rates and a shortage of homes for sale. A prolonged stall in home construction could magnify home shortages and affordability issues, economists warn..“Political uncertainty in Washington is making homebuilders cautious and they are sensing that the public sees this is not the best time to be in the market for a new home unless you’re desperate,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at financial markets research company FWDBonds, wrote in a note to investors Friday. “Trade tariff uncertainty is disrupting the housing market… The only certainty is that this is not the time to build or buy a new home.”.Housing starts are often seen as a key indicator of the overall health and direction of the US economy. When single-family housing starts plunge, as they did in April, it could be a worrying sign..However, recent moves by the Trump administration to ease tariffs could reinvigorate homebuilding, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, the National Association of Homebuilders’ (NAHB) assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis..“Recent developments on the tariff front concerning the United Kingdom and China along with major tax legislation advancing in Congress should provide a boost to housing demand and positive momentum for the economy,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said in a statement on Friday..Builders who spoke to CNN attributed the slowdown in home building to two factors: increased material costs due to tariffs and faltering demand for new homes as home shoppers grew more hesitant amid April’s stock market gyrations and tariff-induced recession fears..The full and final tariff rates imposed on all US imports are still unclear. In April, President Donald Trump announced tariffs on roughly 60 trading partners of up to 50%. While those tariffs are currently on pause, a baseline 10% tariff on most imports is still in place as the US works to negotiate new trade agreements. So far, one deal has been reached with the United Kingdom.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariffs-dragging-down-already-093050166.html,"```json

Meanwhile, 10 out of 15 analysts covering Lowe's call it a ""buy,"" with five ""hold"" ratings. The mean price targets for both stocks—at $436 for Home Depot and $270 for Lowe's—would suggest roughly 15% upside from Friday's closing levels..First-quarter sales for Home Depot are expected to rise 8% year-over-year to $39.26 billion, while Lowe's revenue is projected to drop 2% to $20.95 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to decline for both retailers—to $3.56 and $2.87, respectively..Ahead of the reports, analysts from UBS said that while they are not ""expecting any real earth-shattering news"" from the first-quarter results, they like the stocks for several reasons. The analysts pointed to relatively stable demand despite tariff uncertainty, with room for improvement later this year if the housing market turns around..Morgan Stanley analysts echoed the comments, and called the retailers ""high quality bellwethers."" They expect both retailers to hold their previous full-year forecasts steady, but noted that they could introduce broader ranges to reflect the uncertainty, as some other companies have done this earnings season..JPMorgan analysts recently trimmed their price targets for Home Depot and Lowe's to $410 and $263, respectively, from $470 and $300 previously. They lowered their comparable sales projections for the first quarter as the analysts said they believe tariff-fueled uncertainty ""is having an effect on bigger ticket spending,"" a category Lowe's and Home Depot struggled with last year as squeezed consumers avoided big purchases..Read the original article on Investopedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-think-home-depot-lowes-090000479.html,"```json

(NYSE:HD) will release its first-quarter earnings results before the opening bell on Tuesday, May 20..Analysts expect the Atlanta, Georgia-based company to report quarterly earnings at $3.59 per share. That’s down from $3.63 per share in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, Home Depot projects to report quarterly revenue at $39.14 billion, compared to $36.42 billion a year earlier..On May 8, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem maintained Home Depot with an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $445 to $420..With the recent buzz around Home Depot, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Currently, Home Depot offers an annual dividend yield of 2.43%. Its quarterly dividend is $2.30 per share ($9.20 a year). .So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?.To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $246,676 or around 652 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $49,222 or around 130 shares..See Also: Citizens And 2 Other Stocks Under $3 Insiders Are Buying.View more earnings on HD.To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($9.20 in this case). So, $6,000 / $9.20 = 652 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $9.20 = 130 shares ($100 per month)..Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time..How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price..For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40)..Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield..HD Price Action: Shares of Home Depot gained 1.6% to close at $378.63 on Thursday...Read More: .Wall Street’s Most Accurate Analysts Give Their Take On 3 Consumer Stocks Delivering High-Dividend Yields.Image: Shutterstock.UNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

And joining us now is David Bellinger, director and senior analyst at Mizuho Americas. David, it is good to see you. I I do want your take on on the Walmart results, David. Uh, you know, mixed results, but uh, it's it's the talk of tariffs and price hikes getting getting attention there. I I'm curious just to get your take. What what do you make of the report and commentary from the company? .Yeah, thanks for having me back on. We looked at this as very solid Q1 print. The stock was all over the place this morning. It was up pre-market. It was down 5% at the open. We've clawed back most of those losses or almost flat. But it it looked like the demand picture was getting overlooked here. So sales picked up each and every month of Q1. I thought the commentary on the start to Q2 was pretty constructive. But what's happening here is Walmart did not provide Q2 operating income or earnings per share, uh, guidance for for the quarter, and it it looks like you might have some of these wild swings because of the price increases, so they don't know. It seems like the the ranges implied are very wide. So that uncertainty what is what led to this this downdraft in shares today. And also just entering the print, you've had a big run up. The stocks up almost 20% off the April lows. So we think that this was, uh, sort of a sell the news event, but the demand picture, we thought we thought was, uh, pretty good in general. .David, um, Walmart obviously doesn't raise its prices that often or that by that much, right? That's one of the reasons, um, that it has remained popular with shoppers. When it does, what tends to be the effect and what do you expect to happen this time? .Well, for any retailer, when you raise prices, you you usually see volumes slow down. This elasticity of demand type impact and demand destruction. So what Walmart's doing here is raising prices. I mean, you you essentially have to with 145% tariff goods, even at 30%, is hard to absorb all of those costs. So prices have to go up across the board, across retail. But what Walmart has here, which is pretty unique to them, is we see this optionality to not raise prices as quickly. You keep those spreads versus your competitors pretty wide, and they're even taking some prices down, which we think is the more interesting piece here. It should drive volume. Why why they can do this is they've got this second P&L, right? They've got advertising, marketplace, membership. So those are really high margin businesses, and they are growing incredibly fast. And that's basically funding any type of gross margin hit they might have. They'll have an offset with those businesses. And just just a small example here, the advertising business almost a five billion dollar annual run rate business, that's bigger than Pinterest, growing faster than Pinterest. So it it's very interesting dynamic here and very unique to Walmart that they've got these accretive drivers in the background.

Adjusted earnings per share grew 1.7% year over year to $0.61, beating estimates of $0.58. US same-store sales also beat expectations with a 4.5% increase, led by health and wellness, and groceries..But Walmart stock edged down slightly as it signaled more pain ahead..""We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible, but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in the release. He added on the earnings call that tariffs have already led to price increases in April and May..Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet.McMillon said the ""reset of costs"" will continue throughout the year, adding for an ""imported item, you pay the tariff at the time it comes through customs ... even if the tariff rate comes down later, the cost has been elevated."".Robert Ohmes of Bank of America estimates Walmart imports roughly 15% of its US sales from China. Around 60% of the US sales are groceries, which are largely tariff-exempt if they're produced domestically or in Mexico and Canada..McMillon said that ""tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses."".He added that the company is trying to ""keep food prices as low as possible,"" and hopes it can get help from policy changes..In the quarter, adjusted operating income growth of 2.8% beat its guidance of 0.5% to 2%, though it had walked that range down last month. Prior to Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement, Walmart had guided to annual adjusted operating profit growth of 3.5% to 5.5% on a Feb. 20 earnings release..The company expects net sales for the second quarter to increase 3.5% to 4.5%. It did not provide guidance for adjusted earnings or operating income, as ""the dynamic nature of the backdrop"" makes it ""exceedingly wide and difficult to predict,"" Rainey said in the release..For the full year, the company reiterated its conservative 2026 fiscal year guidance.

Get prepared with the key expectations.,"Lowe's (LOW) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price..The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 21, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise..This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.6%..Revenues are expected to be $20.95 billion, down 2% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-lowes-low-report-140005886.html,"```json

190,2025-05-13 22:00:00,Home Depot (HD) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Home Depot (HD) possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,"The market expects Home Depot (HD) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates..The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise..This home-improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.1%..Revenues are expected to be $39.33 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.37% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-hd-expected-beat-140005596.html,"```json

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Home Depot (HD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this home-improvement retailer have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry, which Home Depot falls in, has gained 6.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Home Depot is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share, indicating a change of -1.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15 points to a change of -1.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.49 indicates a change of +9.9% from what Home Depot is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Home Depot.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-home-depot-130014934.html,"```json

DDS is expected to register year-over-year top and bottom-line declines when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 numbers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues of $1.54 billion indicates a 0.6% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $9.10 per share, implying a 17.9% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate has been unchanged in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company registered an earnings surprise of 39.5%. We note that in the trailing four quarters, its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.1%, on average.

Quote.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Dillard’s this time around.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dillard’s currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3..Dillard’s has been witnessing the adverse impacts of a tough retail environment due to the cautious buying behavior of consumers for a while now. This has continued to impact its sales and comparable-store sales (comps), and has led to higher operating expenses. The persistence of these trends is expected to have affected the top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter.Our model predicts a comps decline of 1.1% for the fiscal first quarter due to a challenging retail environment. Retail sales are expected to dip 1.3% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.Additionally, higher payroll and payroll-related expenses are likely to have dented margins and the bottom line in the fiscal first quarter.While we expect SG&A expenses to increase 2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the SG&A expense rate is anticipated to expand 90 basis points to 28%. Our model predicts an 18% year-over-year decline in operating profit, with a 260-bps contraction in the operating margin.However, Dillard's has been gaining from better inventory management initiatives and strong consumer demand. The company’s focus on inventory management, store and e-commerce development and offering trendy merchandise has strengthened its position in the competitive retail landscape.The company’s efforts to capture growth opportunities in brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce have been key drivers.

Its activewear brands are expected to have gained market share in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the e-commerce business has been well-placed on the enhancement of merchandise assortments and effective inventory management.

LOW and Williams-Sonoma WSM..Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:.While equity markets have rebounded from last month's tariff-driven volatility, global investors appear to be gradually rotating into non-dollar denominated assets. Alongside leading international markets like Japan, financial stocks, particularly global institutions, are attracting renewed attention..Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group stands out as both the largest financial institution in Japan and one of the largest banking groups in the world. With over $3 trillion in assets and operations across more than 50 countries, MUFG provides a full spectrum of financial services, including commercial and trust banking, asset management, and securities trading, to retail and institutional clients alike..Beyond benefiting from capital flows into international equities and global financials, MUFG also boasts a top Zacks Rank, reasonable valuation, and notable relative strength, all pointing to growing investor interest. While it may not be the most disruptive or fastest-growing stock in the market, Mitsubishi UFJ offers something increasingly valuable in today's environment: steady, low-volatility returns in an uncertain world..At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual meeting, Warren Buffett reiterated his enthusiasm for Japanese equities, stating he plans to hold shares in Japan's five major trading houses, including Mitsubishi Financial, for ""50 years or more.""

However, long-term growth plans and strong retail strategy keep investor sentiment cautiously optimistic.","The Home Depot Inc. HD stock has lost 12.3% in the past three months, marking an outperformance from the broader industry’s 14.7% fall. However, it has underperformed the Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s declines of 10.5% and 7.9%, respectively.Despite the dip, the HD stock performance is better than its industry peers like Lowe’s Companies Inc. LOW, Williams-Sonoma WSM and Haverty Furniture Companies HVT, which have lost 12.9%, 24.7% and 14.4%, respectively, in the past three months.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .At the current price of $362.75, the HD stock trades at a discount of 17.4% to its 52-week high of $439.37. The current stock price reflects a 12% premium from its 52-week-low mark.HD trades above its 200-day moving averages, signaling strong upward momentum and price stability. This technical strength indicates positive market sentiment and confidence in the company's financial health and prospects.Home Depot’s stock performance shows mixed sentiments based on its comparisons to industry, sector and the market as a whole, as well as its historical benchmarks. Let us find out how we should play the stock..While HD’s recent price decline may raise concerns among investors, its ongoing strategic initiatives continue to draw favorable sentiment. That said, evaluating whether the stock is a smart buy at current levels requires a closer look at both its growth levers and operational pressures.Home Depot has delivered consistent growth by capitalizing on its leadership in the home improvement space and executing its “One Home Depot” strategy. This plan emphasizes investments in technology, supply-chain modernization and digital transformation. The company’s ability to cater to both DIY customers and professional contractors has been instrumental in maintaining customer loyalty and broadening its market appeal.With a vast store network, a comprehensive product offering and a growing online presence, HD is well-positioned to meet evolving consumer demands. Its interconnected retail model and strong tech infrastructure have driven web traffic and supported the buildout of a scalable Pro ecosystem, solidifying its competitive advantage.However, the company continues to grapple with ongoing challenges, including softened demand and pressure in high-ticket discretionary categories, factors that have impacted both total and comparable sales. For fiscal 2025, Home Depot projects a 2.8% year-over-year increase in sales, suggesting a slowdown from the 4.5% growth reported in fiscal 2024. Comparable sales are expected to rise just 1%, while the gross margin is forecast to remain flat at 33.4%. The operating margin is projected at 13%, with an adjusted figure of 13.4% — both slightly lower than the prior year.Macroeconomic pressures are also weighing on profitability. Elevated interest rates, which surged in early 2024, continue to impact consumer behavior and financing costs. The company expects net interest expenses to increase to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2025 from the $2.1 billion reported in the prior year.As a result, Home Depot anticipates a 3% decline in GAAP earnings per share and a 2% year-over-year fall in adjusted EPS.

197,2025-05-09 00:10:00,Why Home Depot (HD) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Home Depot (HD) has an impressive earnings surprise history and currently possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely beat in its next quarterly report.,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Home Depot (HD), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry..When looking at the last two reports, this home-improvement retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.40%, on average, in the last two quarters..For the last reported quarter, Home Depot came out with earnings of $3.13 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 per share, representing a surprise of 2.96%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.64 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.78 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.85%..Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Home Depot lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank..Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Home Depot has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 20, 2025..With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss..Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-home-depot-hd-could-161005886.html,"```json

198,2025-05-08 21:00:00,How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,The Zacks Earnings ESP is a great way to find potential earnings surprises. Why investors should take advantage now.,"Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important..We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises..The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.
