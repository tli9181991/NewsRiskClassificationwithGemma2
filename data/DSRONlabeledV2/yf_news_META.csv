I'm Josh Lipton and for the next half hour, we are breaking down the trends of today that will move stocks tomorrow. There's a lot to keep track of, so we're focusing on what you need to know to get ahead of the curve. AI is still alive and well on Wall Street, but the landscape keeps changing as various players enter the AI arena. For more on what you need to know about the biggest names in the game, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Tech editor, and that would be Dan Howley. Dan. .That's right, Josh. We're just going to break down some of the, the bigger names. So to start things off, obviously the 800 pound gorilla, that's OpenAI, and we're going to put Microsoft in there together with them since they have teamed up. Obviously, it's been a very lucrative relationship between the two. Uh, OpenAI has ChatGPT kind of kicked off the entire generative AI explosion. Uh, Microsoft has been using that technology in its co-pilot and and its Azure platform. But more recently, the two were at loggerheads. They can't come to an agreement over how OpenAI should restructure its own business. And so that is leading to some reports that Microsoft may be, you know, trying to work on its own generative AI offerings while OpenAI may be trying to work on its own productivity suites. But after OpenAI and Microsoft, there's obviously Google. Uh, we have their Gemini service. It's similar to what you would get out of ChatGPT. Uh, they offer document creation. Uh, you can upload files, you can create images, things along those lines, but it also has the power of Google behind it. You might have probably used Gemini if you've used basically any Google product at this point because it's across the entire company's ecosystem, whether that's through YouTube, mail, docs, even your regular Google search, when you see AI overviews, that's powered by Gemini. Then after that, we have obviously Meta. Uh, Mark Zuckerberg is trying to recadjigger the company once again after the metaverse fiasco that didn't really go anywhere except for give us some weird looking legless avatars. Uh, now he's going all in on AI, and they seem to be doing relatively well here. Uh, they obviously have Meta AI. It's available through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The problem though is their most recent model called Lama for Behemoth seems to be delayed, and there's no end in sight for when that delay will end. And so now, Meta is going out and scooping up talent from other AI companies, whether that's the CEO of Scale AI, Alexander Wang. Uh, we also had Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO, uh and Safe Super Intelligence, their CEO, Daniel Gross. They've all been packed up. Uh, Sam Altman at OpenAI said Meta is trying to offer some of his employees hundred million dollars to sign on. So I said that on a podcast with his brother, so we can't really know if that's for certain. Uh, after that, obviously, there's some others. There's XAI. That's from Elon Musk. He offers Grock through that. That is their chatbot. You can get it through X. Uh, you can use it on the website or through an app. Big thing about Grock is it's able to pull data not only from the web, but also from X, so it can get live data through there. Then we have others, we have Perplexity. That is basically a search engine built with generative AI in mind. Probably the best example of a competitor to what Google has to offer. Uh, it also has a lot of sourcing available, so it'll show you the sources of each, from each of those results that you search for. Obviously, you can also generate images if you want to do that, things along those lines. Uh, and then finally, we have Anthropic. That's gotten a lot of funding through Google and Amazon. It's available through a number of services, and they as well offer a kind of web browser experience where you can search, you can create different documents and things along those lines. But really, those are the major players that you have to be watching out for. There's a few others. Uh, obviously, we have Thinking Machines from OpenAI alumni. We also have a few others like Mistral out of France. Uh, but these seven here are really the biggest players at the moment. .All right. Thank you, Dan.

1,2025-06-26 18:37:00,Meta’s quest to dominate the AI world,Meta is on a quest to dominate the AI world. One way or another.,"Facebook parent Meta (META) is spending billions of dollars to grab the lead in the AI race, building out the data centers needed to develop and power high-end large language models. And now, the company is pouring billions more into snatching up top talent and technologies to grab the lead in the AI wars..In its latest hiring coup, Meta has poached three OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) researchers — Google DeepMind alums Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — from its Zurich office, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has offered the company's employees upward of $100 million to join his AI efforts..Meanwhile, Meta is reportedly in talks to bag Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross and former Github CEO Nat Friedman for its planned superintelligence lab. Zuckerberg was initially eyeing all of Safe Superintelligence, but was shot down by co-founder Ilya Sutskever, according to CNBC..The moves come after Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI startup Scale AI and hired its CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang. That’s not all: Meta also wanted to buy Perplexity AI (PEAI.PVT) but couldn’t come to terms on a deal..“Meta is doing this because they want to win the AI race, period,” Forrester analyst Mike Proulx told Yahoo Finance. “AI is everything right now.”.All of this follows Meta’s decision to postpone the debut of its massive Llama 4 Behemoth AI model. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company won’t launch the model until later this fall over concerns that it isn’t a big enough upgrade over prior models..“I think this is two things: No. 1 [is] confirmation that Llama is struggling,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “And second, is [it’s] also a sign that Zuckerberg is not OK with that.”.For Meta, the goal is clear: bring in as much fresh talent as possible to push its AI program forward and take the lead in the AI wars..Meta’s effort to rule the AI world differs from its chief rivals, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. Rather than closing off its AI models, the company offers them as open-source software that developers and companies can use on their own..Meta imposes some restrictions on how users can take advantage of its models. For instance, the company requires firms to request a license from Meta if their product has more than 700 million monthly active users..Regardless, Meta’s ultimate goal is to get as many people as it’s comfortable with using and developing products via its AI models. Why not charge everyone who wants to access its software? Because Meta benefits every time a company alters its models, giving it greater insights into how it can improve them down the line.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-quest-to-dominate-the-ai-world-184836143.html,"```json

2,2025-06-27 09:19:00,Former OpenAI researcher Lucas Beyer pours cold water on $100 million Meta signing bonus,"“We did not get 100M sign-on, that’s fake news,” the AI researcher posted on X.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told his brother that Mark Zuckerberg was offering compensation packages worth more than $100 million to lure OpenAI staff to Meta. Altman said he was happy that none of the best minds at OpenAI had gone for the golden ticket so far. On Thursday, three OpenAI researchers who lead the firm’s Zurich office announced they would join Meta..The trio of OpenAI engineers who co-founded the firm’s Zurich office last year will indeed be leaving to join Meta—but they aren’t getting $100 million apiece to do so..Lucas Beyer posted on X Thursday that he, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai would depart OpenAI to join the $1.8 trillion company led by Mark Zuckerberg. Beyer said it was “fake news” that Zuckerberg was paying him that level of compensation. However, that news came from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself, who called the offers “crazy” this month..“They started making these like, giant offers, to a lot of people on our team—$100 million signing bonuses, more than that comp per year,” Altman told his brother Jack Altman in an episode of the podcast Uncapped. “I’m really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.”.Beyer, Kolesnikov, and Zhai have been members of the technical staff at OpenAI since December 2024, which they joined after being poached from rival Google DeepMind. They depart for Meta at a time when competition for talent among AI firms is reaching a frenzied pitch, with Zuckerberg reportedly on a recruitment spree to counter the narrative that it is lagging behind in AI development. Reports claim the company is hiring a 50-person “Superintelligence” team to ramp up its AI efforts. Meta has also purchased a $14 billion stake in Scale AI, to bring CEO Alexandr Wang into the fold..Zuckerberg famously earns only $1 as CEO at Meta, although the company provides him a $14 million allowance for costs related to security for Zuckerberg and his family. He holds about 13% of the tech behemoth’s stock and his fortune is valued at $250 billion by Forbes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-openai-researcher-lucas-beyer-001932926.html,"```json

He once said that he wakes up at three in the morning and goes:.""What an idiot. Why didn’t I invest more in Bitcoin?"".While it might seem odd that Laffont put Bitcoin on par with some of the world's most valuable companies, his assessment isn't entirely off the mark..If Bitcoin — with a market cap of $2.13 trillion — were an asset, it would be the world's fifth-largest company behind Nvidia ($3.78 trillion), Microsoft ($3.69 trillion), Apple ($3 trillion), and Amazon ($2.3 trillion)..Laffont thinks Bitcoin's market cap could potentially grow more than twice to over $5 trillion by 2030. Interestingly, he didn't even include Apple and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) in his ""Fantastic 40"" companies list..As per Kraken's price feed, Bitcoin was trading at $107,511.08 at press time, up 77% a year..Billionaire predicts 'Fantastic 40' companies by 2030, one surprise pick stands out first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 26, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 26, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-predicts-fantastic-40-companies-231000066.html,"```json

4,2025-06-27 07:26:00,Why Meta Platforms Stock Topped the Market Today,"The social media titan is apparently pushing harder into artificial intelligence with its courtship of a small company.  It apparently is in advanced talks to buy voice recognition specialist PlayAI.  The social media giant, not typically known for being an aggressive asset buyer, saw its shares close more than 2% higher as a result.","The social media titan is apparently pushing harder into artificial intelligence with its courtship of a small company..It apparently is in advanced talks to buy voice recognition specialist PlayAI..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Somewhat atypically, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock rose higher on Thursday because of a potential acquisition. The social media giant, not typically known for being an aggressive asset buyer, saw its shares close more than 2% higher as a result. This was on a day when the S&P 500 index could only muster an 0.8% rally..It helps greatly that the apparent acquisition target concentrates on artificial intelligence (AI), the hot technology of our age. On Thursday, Bloomberg, citing unnamed ""people familiar with the matter,"" wrote that Meta was close to acquiring privately held PlayAI, a niche company specializing in AI voice replication technology..In the article, which was disseminated in other media outlets, Bloomberg said that its PlayAI play was a component of Meta's strategy to advance its AI capabilities and offerings. When and if a deal is reached for the company, Meta would bring at least some PlayAI into its workforce..The story did not detail any financial particulars of the potential acquisition..Neither Meta nor PlayAI has provided an official response to the Bloomberg article..With its vast financial resources -- it held over $70 billion in cash and cash equivalents alone at the end of its most recently reported quarter -- Meta can pay handsome premiums for assets it desires. Given that, it's believable that if it truly is interested in PlayAI, it's making the company a compelling buyout offer..The impact of a potential acquisition is a bit tougher to gauge. PlayAI is an AI company, yes, and that'll get investors excited simply on that basis. Voice recognition is a fairly niche (albeit useful) technology, so I don't think this apparently looming deal will be a ground shifter on its own. It's worth watching Meta's other moves in the AI sphere, though, to gauge how it plans to leverage the technology..Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this..On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late.

5,2025-06-27 06:45:00,Meta Platforms (META) Laps the Stock Market: Here's Why,"In the latest trading session, Meta Platforms (META) closed at $726.09, marking a +2.46% move from the previous day.","In the latest trading session, Meta Platforms (META) closed at $726.09, marking a +2.46% move from the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.8%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.94%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.97%..Heading into today, shares of the social media company had gained 10.11% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.5% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.12%..The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $5.75, marking a 11.43% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $44.37 billion, showing a 13.55% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter..For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $25.25 per share and revenue of $185.92 billion, which would represent changes of +5.83% and +13.02%, respectively, from the prior year..Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the business operations and its ability to generate profits..Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system..The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.39% higher. At present, Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold)..From a valuation perspective, Meta Platforms is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.07. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 28 of its industry..One should further note that META currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.74. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.22..The Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 48, positioning it in the top 20% of all 250+ industries.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-laps-stock-214504341.html,"```json

You have the option to now set filters to expire within 30 days as a way to “snooze” them until you want to see the related posts in the app again..For example, this setting could be helpful in situations where you’re not caught up on a TV show and don’t want to see spoilers on your feed, but want to eventually see posts related to the TV show at a later point when you’re caught up..The move comes two weeks after the social network began testing a DM inbox that’s separate from users’ Instagram DM Inboxes.

Analysts project earnings of US$85.9 billion by June 2028, with a slight decrease in profit margins to 35.2%. However, the anticipated PE ratio of 25.8x by 2028 exceeds the industry average, which could impact investor sentiment. Potential fluctuations in AI development costs and compliance modifications in Europe might affect cash flows, but the initiatives in AI stand to significantly expand Meta’s market presence and drive future growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-nasdaqgs-meta-expands-174940712.html,"```json

The company owns and operates platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Threads, making it a household name with a giant footprint..Meta’s stock has gained 23.5% YTD but had struggled before picking up the pace toward the end of April.

The company generated $42.31 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year while surpassing analysts’ estimate of $41.24 billion..During the quarter, Meta saw a 6% annual rise in its family daily active people, which climbed to 3.43 billion.

In the most bullish scenario, annual revenue from WhatsApp ads could surpass $6 billion. Meta says these ads will not interfere with private messages and calls and will be limited to the Updates sections, frequented by 1.5 billion users daily..Beyond advertisements, the company is also exploring other avenues for revenue such as Channels promotions or Channels Subscriptions. Morgan Stanley believes Meta’s extensive ad infrastructure supported by the global users should be able to support this projected revenue growth..Analysts are bullish on the tech giant with a consensus “Strong Buy” rating but its mean price target of $715.52 is below its current trading price.

The internet is only a few decades old..Technological innovation has accelerated significantly since the early 2000s, with the internet playing a pivotal role in paving the way for cloud computing. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as the next growth frontier for investors. The companies leading the way have grown to immense size and scale, garnering the nickname the ""Magnificent Seven."".The exciting part is that it appears there is still a massive runway ahead for future innovation and the continuation of ongoing trends. Three companies stand out to me. They have become juggernauts and could be unstoppable technology leaders well into the future..Here are the three monster stocks you should consider investing in for the long term..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a huge impact since the push to build artificial intelligence infrastructure went into overdrive in late 2022. Companies continue to race to build massive data centers with thousands of the company's GPU accelerator chips. It started with Nvidia's Hopper microarchitecture and has since evolved into Blackwell. According to IoT Analytics Research, Nvidia owns an estimated 92% of the AI data center GPU market..While data center spending continues to rip and roar in 2025, it's wise to think about AI's next innings. There is a good chance that computing resources will expand beyond data centers to localized areas where they can power new technologies, such as humanoid robotics or autonomous vehicles. Nvidia already has its eyes on these opportunities, fleshing out an ecosystem of hardware and developer tools that will entice companies to build on its platform..Many of the companies building all these data centers continue to struggle with capacity constraints, so it doesn't seem that Nvidia's business will slow anytime soon. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 today. That may seem like a lot, but considering analysts estimate Nvidia will grow earnings by nearly 29% annualized over the long term, the reigning AI leader should continue to deliver for investors over the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-stocks-unstoppable-monsters-163400575.html,"```json

18,2025-06-27 01:18:00,Meta Looks to Acquire More Talent for its Expanding AI Push,Meta's looking to acquire an AI voice generation start-up as it continues to develop its next-gen tools.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .As more and more AI features filter into Meta’s apps, it’s worth noting that it’s not even close to done with its AI expansion plans just yet, with the company investing $65 billion into AI projects this year alone, as it looks to become the leader in the broader AI race..And according to reports, that could soon see Meta expanding into conversational AI, that can talk to you in a more relatable, custom voice..As reported by Bloomberg:.“Meta is in advanced talks to acquire PlayAI, a small startup using artificial intelligence to replicate voices […] Meta is expected to acquire the California-based startup’s technology and some of its employees, according to people familiar with the matter.”.The deal, it’s worth noting, is not finalized as yet, but Bloomberg speculates that this is another means for Meta to acquire AI talent, as part of its bigger push to dominate the AI development race..Over the past few weeks, Meta’s been on an AI hiring spree, offering massive packages to some of the top researchers and experts in the industry. It’s already signed up Scale CEO Alexandr Wang as the lead for its new AI “superintelligence” project, while it’s also hired various former OpenAI researchers to join the next-level project. .The aim of Meta’s “superintelligence” initiative is to create AI systems that can exceed the capacity of the human brain, and can actually “think” and reason in ways beyond the realm of the current wave of AI models. .Whether that’s even possible is another question of debate, but Meta’s making a major push to at least test the limits of AI, and what can be done with logic-trained systems. .Conversational AI tools could be another aspect of this, though it may also help Meta to build its existing AI bot models, with further customization options to create your own responsive AI likeness..Meta’s been developing its AI bot platform for some time, which enables creators to build AI versions of themselves that their audience can converse with at any time..Custom voices could add another element to this, ensuring that Meta’s AI bots are more relatable, more engaging, and are easier to talk to via its evolving wearables offerings. .Whether or not people actually want that is another question, and there is some precedent to suggest that AI bots in the likeness of celebrities, or anybody else, won’t catch on a Meta hopes..Back in 2023, Meta rolled out a range of chatbots on Messenger, which provided responses that had been guided by stars like Kendall Jenner, Dwyane Wade, MrBeast, and many more.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-looks-acquire-more-talent-161805727.html,"```json

Bansal’s LinkedIn page says that he left OpenAI in June..Bansal has worked at OpenAI since 2022 and was a key player in kickstarting the company’s work on reinforcement learning alongside co-founder Ilya Sutskever. He is listed as a foundational contributor on OpenAI’s first AI reasoning model, o1..Bansal could offer a significant lift to Meta’s AI superintelligence lab, which also features leaders such as former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and is looking to add former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Gross. Bansal could help Meta develop a frontier AI reasoning model that’s competitive with industry-leading technology, such as OpenAI’s o3 or DeepSeek’s R1. Currently, Meta does not offer an AI reasoning model publicly..In recent months, Mark Zuckerberg has been on a hiring spree to build out Meta’s new AI team, offering $100 million compensation packages to top researchers who join his company. It’s unclear what Bansal was offered to join in this deal..Nevertheless, it seems that Zuckerberg has been successful at nabbing top AI research talent..Three other former OpenAI researchers — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — have also joined Meta’s AI superintelligence team in recent weeks, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Bansal will join them, alongside former Google DeepMind researcher Jack Rae and former machine learning leader at the startup Sesame, Johan Schalkwyk, according to Bloomberg..To further fill out its new AI unit, Zuckerberg reportedly tried to acquire startups with heavy-hitting AI research labs, such as Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Labs, and Perplexity. However, those talks never progressed to a final stage..On a recent podcast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta has been trying to poach his startup’s top talent, but claimed that “none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.”.A Meta spokesperson declined to comment..AI reasoning models present a key area for Meta’s AI superintelligence team to get right. In the last year, OpenAI, Google, and DeepSeek have shipped highly performant AI reasoning models that have pushed the limits of what software can do. By training AI models to work through problems before giving an answer, using additional time and computing resources to do so, AI labs have found success in improving AI’s performance on benchmarks and real-world tasks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-161359251.html,"```json

While MSFT is definitely a great company, this article will show why it currently is not a buy for me, mainly because there are better deals in other mag-7 companies at lower valuations and better fundamentals..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96%..The same can also be said for growth. While MSFT is not as far ahead of other companies as it was in terms of profitability, a revenue growth rate of 14.13% and an EBITDA growth rate of 19.16% are still great. Furthermore, forward growth rates are even stronger than current ones, suggesting a positive outlook. Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE growth expected to be negative..As with all Mag-7 companies, valuation is the biggest problem for Microsoft. Everyone already knows that we are talking about a great company, so the most important thing to get right is to find a good entrance price. Currently, the EV/EBITDA ratio of the stock is relatively high at 22.8, a 31% premium to the industry median. Moreover, the P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium, respectively. The P/E ratio at 35.11 is also very high at the moment. Figure 1 shows the historical P/E ratio of MSFT as can be seen, the company currently trades at 2020 and 2023 levels, leaving it at a higher bound of its average valuation..When comparing Microsoft's user base to that of other Mag-7 companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), one can instantly see that the company's valuation is elevated. At around 1.5 billion users and a market cap of 3.35T, the company has a valuation of $2.233 per user. At the same time, GOOG and META only have valuations of $820 and $494 per user, respectively, making them much cheaper in comparison. Additionally, ROE is a weak point too, with only Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) being worse at 8.79% and 25.24%, respectively..From a growth perspective, Microsoft is solid but does not particularly stand out at slightly better revenue growth but significantly less EBITDA growth than Alphabet. Furthermore, the negative ROE growth is the second worst in the peer group, with only Tesla's ROE falling by almost 70%. In total, Microsoft seems fundamentally somewhere around the average, with profitability being a strength while growth is a comparative weakness.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currently-better-options-microsoft-093720326.html,"```json

The multiple reflects Meta’s potential to sustain faster advertising revenue growth by incorporating generative AI into its products, it added..None of the expected long-term revenue from AI tools are currently factored into UBS or consensus models, the note said, while the costs tied to AI talent and infrastructure appear largely reflected in Meta’s guidance..CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted business messaging and Meta AI as two of the company’s five main AI initiatives during its first-quarter earnings call in April.

26,2025-06-26 21:30:00,Can Broadcom Stock Hit $400 in 2025?,HSBC has slapped a Street-high $400 price target on Broadcom stock.,"Chip giant Broadcom (AVGO) doesn’t always make the front page when the artificial intelligence (AI) conversation kicks off. Instead, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) tend to dominate the headlines. But Broadcom has quietly and steadily become a key player behind the curtain. As AI reshapes everything from cloud infrastructure to autonomous vehicles, Broadcom’s influence is proving to be anything but background noise..Now sitting comfortably in the trillion-dollar club, Broadcom’s strength lies in its highly specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which power the custom AI chips used by tech leaders like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META). These ASICs form the backbone of modern data centers, enabling the intense computational workloads required for cutting-edge AI models..Tesla’s Robotaxis Reportedly Sped and Veered Into the Wrong Lanes.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else..In fact, Broadcom has recently stepped into the spotlight. This time, it's thanks to a bold new Street-high price target of $400 from HSBC, signaling strong conviction in the company’s long-term growth. Could Broadcom actually hit that mark before year-end?.Based in Palo Alto, California, Broadcom spans semiconductors, enterprise software, and cybersecurity, offering a broad portfolio that supports critical technology infrastructure. Its solutions are found across cloud platforms, data centers, wireless networks, and connected devices, playing a behind-the-scenes role in keeping digital systems up and running..With a market capitalization hovering around $1.2 trillion, Broadcom has shown impressive strength in 2025, managing to outperform despite broader market choppiness. While the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained a modest 3.5% year-to-date (YTD), AVGO stock has surged with a 14% YTD climb..The real momentum, however, has come in recent months. Shares have surged 40% over the past three months alone, fueled by rising demand for AI infrastructure and investor optimism. Looking over the past year, Broadcom’s 67% return dwarfs the S&P 500’s 11% gain, highlighting just how sharply the chip giant has broken away from the pack..In its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report released on June 5, Broadcom delivered a standout performance. The firm posted revenue of $15 billion, narrowly beating estimates of $14.95 billion and marking a strong 20% year-over-year (YOY) increase. The growth was fueled by soaring demand for AI semiconductors, while contributions from VMware added an extra boost to the top line, reinforcing Broadcom’s expanding footprint across both hardware and software.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-stock-hit-400-2025-133002755.html,"```json

NVDA — the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) — regained the crown of the world’s most valuable company in terms of market capital..On June 25, the stock price of NVDA closed at an all-time high of $154.31, with a market capital of $3.763 trillion, surpassing one of its major client Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT market capital of around $3.66 trillion..NVIDIA recorded its previous all-time high of $149.41 at January end. Thereafter, the stock fell significantly due to the unveiling of the low-cost Chinese DeepSeek AI platform, the Trump administration’s decision to stop the export of NVDA’s high-end H20 AI processor to China and global turmoil related to trade after President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs..The stock price recorded its recent low in early April. From there, it surged nearly 80% with a year-over-year gain of more than 15%. The recent rally of NVDA is highly commendable despite the fact that the company warned last month that export restrictions would cost it $8 billion in sales and a $4.5 billion inventory write off. NVIDIA is no longer counting any sales from China..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.NVIDIA reaffirmed its commitment to continued innovation, evolution and execution. After the successful execution of Hopper GPUs, NVDA’s Blackwell GPUs have already seen a record high units sold to cloud providers..NVIDIA is expected to unveil Blackwell Ultra — in the second half of 2025 and begin shipping of Vera Rubin — in 2026. In addition, the company decided that it will announce its roadmap for Rubin Next — to be introduced in 2027 and Feynman AI chips in 2028..NVIDIA is supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Four of the “magnificent 7” stocks have decided to invest a massive $325 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 46% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem..Apart from Microsoft, other giant customers are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN. This huge spending on AI infrastructure will dramatically change the world in the next five years in fields like hyperscale automation, robotics, healthcare, energy, materials, financials and cybersecurity. Research firm Oppenheimer estimated that the total addressable global sovereign AI market could be a massive $1.5 trillion..The major innovation for NVDA’s new chipsets is a qualitative shift from pureplay generative AI models to reasoning AI models. NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang, said that contrary to the market’s belief that DeepSeek is a major threat to NVDA’s high-cost chips, it has actually opened a huge growth opportunity for his company.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-regains-lost-glory-buy-121000212.html,"```json

He articulated this struggle recently, saying “at some point we ran this calculation and we're like 'alright, if we were able to do all the things we thought were good, between the additional engagement and usage of our apps and the random taxes and stuff, I think we might be twice as profitable as a company as we are now.”.This statement reflects Zuckerberg’s longstanding frustration with platform dependencies, particularly Apple’s (AAPL) iOS ecosystem, which he argues restricts Meta’s innovation and revenue potential. Apple’s control over app distribution — including its 30% fee on in-app purchases and restrictions on features — directly impacts Meta’s bottom line. For instance, he claims Apple’s limitations on tracking and advertising tools have cost Meta billions in lost ad revenue. Zuckerberg estimates that eliminating these constraints could double Meta’s profitability, a claim grounded in the company’s internal analyses of user engagement and revenue leakage..Tesla’s Robotaxis Reportedly Sped and Veered Into the Wrong Lanes.

Sign Up Now!.Zuckerberg’s authority on this issue stems from his two-decade leadership of Meta, which he co-founded in 2004 and transformed into a social media and technology powerhouse. Under his direction, Meta has navigated multiple technological shifts — from desktop to mobile, and now toward AI and mixed reality — while maintaining a user base exceeding 3 billion people. His critique of Apple is not merely rhetorical; it aligns with Meta’s aggressive investments in alternative platforms, such as VR headsets and AR glasses, designed to reduce reliance on rivals’ ecosystems..The tension between Meta and Apple extends beyond financials to fundamental values. Zuckerberg champions “open platforms” where third-party developers innovate freely, contrasting sharply with Apple’s “walled garden” approach. This philosophical divide has intensified as both companies compete in mixed reality. While Apple’s Vision Pro targets a premium market, Meta’s Quest headsets prioritize affordability and accessibility, with Zuckerberg declaring them “better and 10 times cheaper.” This divergence underscores a broader strategic clash: Apple leverages its integrated hardware-software model, while Meta bets on democratizing access to capture mass adoption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/might-twice-profitable-company-now-120002721.html,"```json

This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors—not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models”..The plaintiffs include comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates..Their lawyer, as reported by AP, said the “court ruled that AI companies that ‘feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them’ are generally violating the law..“Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta’s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta’s favour. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.”.Meta has expressed its appreciation for the court's decision..“Open-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,” Meta was quoted by the publication as saying..The ruling follows another decision from US District Judge William Alsup, who found that AI company Anthropic did not break the law by training its chatbot on millions of copyrighted books..However, Anthropic must still face trial for acquiring those books from pirate websites..Judge Alsup's ruling highlighted that the AI system's process of distilling from thousands of works to produce its own text was “quintessentially transformative” and qualified as “fair use” under US copyright law..The developments come as Meta’s investment in Scale AI has boosted the data-labelling startup’s valuation beyond $29bn..As part of this deal, Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang will lead Meta’s AI efforts while continuing to serve on Scale AI’s board..""US court sides with Meta in authors’ copyright lawsuit "" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand... .The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Nvidia's customers are spending a mind-boggling amount of money on AI infrastructure right now.","Nvidia supplies the most powerful data center chips in the world for artificial intelligence (AI) development..Nvidia has amassed an impressive list of customers, which includes top AI developers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet..Nvidia's customers are spending a mind-boggling amount of money on AI infrastructure right now..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) doesn't disclose its exact customer list. However, the company is the leading supplier of data center chips for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and we know Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, and Oracle are some of the biggest buyers of that hardware based on their public filings..Those data center chips are called graphics processing units (GPUs), and you won't believe the eye-popping amount of money their customers are spending on these chips. Read on..There are two primary AI workloads: Training, which involves feeding truckloads of data into AI models to make them ""smarter,"" and inference, which is the process by which AI models use that data to formulate responses or make predictions. These two workloads are processed in enormous data centers filled with thousands of GPUs, which cost billions of dollars to build..Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have the financial resources to build AI infrastructure to develop their own AI models. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle also build AI data centers and rent out the computing power to smaller developers for profit, which has become a very lucrative business practice because demand for capacity continues to far exceed supply..Here's how much money the top AI companies are spending on AI data centers overall at the moment, based on their public filings:.Amazon is allocating up to $105 billion to capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 alone, most of which will go toward AI data centers and GPUs..Microsoft's 2025 fiscal year will end on June 30, and the company is on track to have spent over $80 billion on AI infrastructure..Alphabet is forecasting AI capex spending of $75 billion in calendar year 2025..Meta Platforms originally planned to spend up to $65 billion to fuel its AI ambitions in 2025, but it recently raised the high end of its forecast to $72 billion..Oracle's 2025 fiscal year recently ended on May 31, and it spent $21.2 billion on AI infrastructure.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has diversified its business over the years.","Meta Platforms' losses on its Reality Labs division have continually risen over the years..The company has invested aggressively into the metaverse without any clear payoff..Now, the company is also spending heavily on artificial intelligence..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has diversified its business over the years. No longer is it just a social media company; it's expanded into artificial intelligence (AI) and of course, the metaverse, and it even changed its name to highlight its focus on that latter opportunity..While Meta Platforms has piled a lot of resources into the metaverse and its Reality Labs division, the payoff simply hasn't been there, and it's questionable whether it ever will be. Recently, the Reality Labs division hit a milestone, which is more indicative of what kind of money pit it has become rather than terrific growth opportunity..If you've been following Meta's performance in recent years, you've likely seen the continual losses from the Reality Labs business, normally totaling multiple billions of dollars per quarter. But with strong revenue growth from advertising and its social media platforms continuing, investors have largely ignored that unattractive part of its financials..In its most recent quarter, however, the operating losses from Reality Labs reached a cumulative total of more than $60 billion. It's a staggering amount that the company has incurred on the business since first reporting on the new segment back in 2021..Year.Operating Loss for Reality Labs.2025 (Q1 only).$4.2 billion.2024.$17.7 billion.2023.$16.1 billion.2022.$13.7 billion.2021.$10.2 billion.Source: Company filings. Table by author..That adds up to $62 billion. And what's noteworthy is that the losses have been increasing over the years..Through the first three months of 2025, Meta grew its profits by 35% to $16.6 billion. Its Family of Apps segment, which includes its core social media assets such as WhatsApp and Facebook, generated an operating profit of nearly $21.8 billion, which easily covered the losses from Reality Labs..While that has masked the issue thus far, there are a couple of reasons why this is worrisome..The first and most obvious one is that eventually this advertising-fueled revenue growth will slow down. If economic conditions slow down, companies are likely to cut back on ad spend. As the growth rate slows and Meta's earnings don't look as impressive anymore, it'll only be a matter of time before more attention is paid to that troubling Reality Labs business. Investors may become more demanding of a payoff from that investment sooner rather than later, and that could lead to a sharp decline in the share price.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-reality-labs-division-010000307.html,"```json

Together, these cases are shaping up to be a win for the tech industry, which has spent years in legal battles with media companies arguing that training AI models on copyrighted works is fair use..However, these decisions aren’t the sweeping wins some companies hoped for — both judges noted that their cases were limited in scope..Judge Chhabria made clear that this decision does not mean that all AI model training on copyrighted works is legal, but rather that the plaintiffs in this case “made the wrong arguments” and failed to develop sufficient evidence in support of the right ones..“This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,” Judge Chhabria said in his decision. Later, he said, “In cases involving uses like Meta’s, it seems like the plaintiffs will often win, at least where those cases have better-developed records on the market effects of the defendant’s use.”.Judge Chhabria ruled that Meta’s use of copyrighted works in this case was transformative — meaning the company’s AI models did not merely reproduce the authors’ books..Furthermore, the plaintiffs failed to convince the judge that Meta’s copying of the books harmed the market for those authors, which is a key factor in determining whether copyright law has been violated..“The plaintiffs presented no meaningful evidence on market dilution at all,” said Judge Chhabria..Both Anthropic’s and Meta’s wins involve training AI models on books, but there are several other active lawsuits against technology companies for training AI models on other copyrighted works. For instance, The New York Times is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for training AI models on news articles, while Disney and Universal are suing Midjourney for training AI models on films and TV shows..Judge Chhabria noted in his decision that fair use defenses depend heavily on the details of a case, and some industries may have stronger fair use arguments than others..“It seems that markets for certain types of works (like news articles) might be even more vulnerable to indirect competition from AI outputs,” said Chhabria.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-judge-sides-meta-lawsuit-234032301.html,"```json

However, Meta AI couldn’t read your messages..Meta said that the new stack allows WhatsApp to access context from your chat privately to process requests through its AI.

The seemingly illogical tumble in energy prices highlighted a new global reality: the world is awash in oil.  Gasoline prices barely moved this week, but experts say motorists will likely see prices at the pump begin to fall, perhaps as early as this weekend.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar on Monday, threatening to stoke a wider conflict in the Middle East, a region that supplies the world with about a third of the oil used globally every year. That same day, benchmark U.S. crude tumbled more than 7%, one of the biggest single day sell-offs this year. The following day, the same thing happened, driving crude prices down by double digits this week..The seemingly illogical tumble in energy prices highlighted a new global reality: the world is awash in oil..Gasoline prices barely moved this week, but experts say motorists will likely see prices at the pump begin to fall, perhaps as early as this weekend..With the situation in the Middle East still volatile, Iran could try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world’s oil passes daily. While few expect Iran to do that because it would cripple the ability to move its own oil, the fact remains that there have been drastic changes in the 50 years since an Arab oil embargo hobbled the U.S. economy and sent energy prices skyrocketing..Following is a quick rundown of the new forces on supply and demand that have reshaped the global energy landscape, and what you can expect to see as far as prices at the pump this weekend..PRICES AT THE PUMP.Technical innovation in the last two decades has upended global energy markets and made the U.S. the world's top oil producer, surpassing even Saudi Arabia in 2018. It's contributed to an extended surplus of oil, and that has consistenly driven prices lower..Gas prices have been in broad decline for roughly three years. That has remained true even during traditional periods of high demand, like the summer travel season just now kicking into high gear..Part of the reason, according to Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, is that the U.S. announced aggressive tariffs against its trading partners at around the time of year that U.S. gas prices usually begin to rise. That suppressed demand, for both households and businesses, due to anticipation of economic fallout from a broader trade war..And prices are likely to begin falling again, and fast. Gas stations bought their fuel supplies before crude prices slumped this week, so motorists have not seen gas prices decline due to a typical lag between oil and gasoline prices..“I think that the national average will probably cease to increase in the next 24 to 48 hours,” Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy said Tuesday. “Then it should stabilize for maybe a day or two and then we should start to see prices — at least the national average — to start falling this weekend.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/middle-east-conflict-highlights-vastly-174015319.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .If you manage a Facebook group that’s been inexplicably banned over the last week or so, you’re not alone..As reported by TechCrunch, thousands of Facebook groups have been suspended of late, with many pointing the finger at faulty AI-detection for incorrectly tagging them as violating the platform’s rules..As per TechCrunch:.“Based on information shared by affected users, many of the suspended Facebook groups aren’t the type that would regularly face moderation concerns, as they focus on fairly innocuous content like savings tips or deals, parenting support, groups for dog or cat owners, gaming groups, Pokémon groups, groups for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, and more. While some of the impacted groups are smaller in size, many are large, with tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of users.”.According to Facebook, the suspensions are based on a technical error, which is in the process of being rectified, with many group admins now being told that they should see their group restored again within 48 hours. .Meta provided this statement to SMT:.“We’re aware of a technical error that impacted some Facebook Groups. This has been resolved.”.So any errors should either be fixed already, or are in the process of being reversed..But even so, the mass-bans have spooked a lot of Facebook group admins, who’ve spent years building their online communities. .As noted, broader discussion about the suspensions has pointed at erroneous flagging by AI tools, though neither Facebook nor Meta has confirmed that this is the root cause in this instance..The concern here is that Meta is increasingly relying on AI, for an increasing array of functions, and that without human intervention, it runs the risk of seeing more errors of this type moving forward..Indeed, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently noted that AI will replace most mid-level engineers at the company soon, and as it continues to expand its AI systems, it seems increasingly likely that Meta will be looking to AI processes to operate more elements of the business..Which is why group admins are concerned about this latest wave of suspensions, as it could reflect a new change in approach at the app, where it becomes increasingly difficult to understand, and/or rectify problems, because you’re dealing with the decisions of the AI overlords, not humans..Again, Meta hasn’t confirmed that AI is at fault in this instance, but it does seem like another example of Meta’s AI automation teething problems, which could point to further complications in future.   ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-says-fixed-issue-led-173334215.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .I tell you what, Meta must be very confident that its AI system is smart enough to understand a broad range of contexts in spoken language, because this new summary option in WhatsApp could cause many headaches if it’s not..Today, WhatsApp has announced Message Summaries, which uses Meta AI to summarize the key notes of your collective messages in a chat..As you can see in this example, now, rather than having to catch up on a chat by reading every messages that’s been sent since you last logged in, Meta AI will be able to give you the cliff notes, by reading and analyzing those DMs for you..Which I doubt that anyone really wants..As explained by WhatsApp:.“We've all been there - rushing between meetings, catching up after a flight without Wi-Fi, or simply having too many chats to catch up on. Sometimes, you just need to quickly catch up on your messages. That's why we're excited to introduce Message Summaries, a new option that uses Meta AI to privately and quickly summarize unread messages in a chat, so you can get an idea of what is happening, before reading the details in your unread messages.”.That’ll no doubt freak a lot of people out, and to be honest, I’m not really sure why WhatsApp is even taking the risk in adding this feature, which I doubt many users have been asking for. .Because WhatsApp is for your private chats and conversations, its whole appeal is privacy, and ensuring that no one else can read what you’re sharing..As such, having an AI system scan and interpret such seems highly problematic. .Which is why WhatsApp’s going to expanded effort to explain itself:.“Message Summaries uses Private Processing technology, which allows Meta AI to generate a response without Meta or WhatsApp ever seeing your messages or the private summaries. No one else in the chat can see that you summarized unread messages either. This means your privacy is protected at all times.”.Yeah, I’m not sure that explanation is going to assure jittery WhatsApp users, who may already be a little spooked by the app recently being banned on U.S. House staff phones, due to questions about message privacy. .WhatsApp has also been accused of sending user data to Israel, while there have also been questions raised about potential vulnerabilities within its encryption process, which could expose limited details about user interactions in the app..So right now, there are already a few concerns being raised about the app’s rock-solid privacy process, so it seems like maybe not the right time to also be like: “Hey, our AI is also reading your messages and summarizing the key points, cool right?”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whatsapp-adds-ai-powered-message-162316126.html,"```json

NuScale is focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs), while Centrus Energy specializes in the enrichment of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which is a critical fuel source for powering SMRs in the future.Per Fortune Business Insight report, the global SMR market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, expanding at a CAGR of 4.98% from 2025 to 2032. Both Nuscale Power and Centrus Energy are likely to gain from the massive growth opportunity, as their technologies are poised to play a key role in meeting the rising global demand for safe, reliable, and carbon-free nuclear energy.So, SMR or LEU — Which of these Nuclear stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out..NuScale Power is benefiting from advancements in SMR technology. The company’s expanding partner base, which includes tech giants and financial institutions, positions SMR as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy. The company is gaining strong momentum across various sectors, especially as energy demands continue to rise. The increasing energy demand, driven by sectors like data centers, which require continuous, reliable, and carbon-free energy, has been a major growth driver.Data centers are expected to triple their energy use over the next three years, accounting for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. This growth trend presents a significant opportunity for NuScale Power, as its small modular reactor technology offers consistent, carbon-free energy that can meet the increasing demands of hyperscale data centers.NuScale Power continues to attract strong interest from major technology companies and infrastructure capital. Companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet and Oracle have made substantial commitments to using nuclear energy, including SMR technology, to meet their sustainability goals, which positively impacts NuScale Power’s market positioning..Centrus Energy is benefiting from increased demand for nuclear fuel, particularly HALEU, and from its role in developing and deploying advanced nuclear technologies like SMRs. HALEU is expected to play a significant role in fueling advanced reactors. The Department of Energy (DOE) has released supplies from its HALEU availability program to five advanced reactor developers, highlighting the growing demand for this type of uranium.LEU recently announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has extended its HALEU production contract through June 30, 2026, as part of Phase III of its ongoing agreement. This follows Centrus’ successful delivery of 20 kg of HALEU in Phase I and ongoing production of 900 kg under Phase II. The extension marks the start of a potential eight additional years of production to support advanced nuclear reactor development.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuscale-power-vs-centrus-energy-153500512.html,"```json

The stock has rallied 14.7% year over year, indicating strong investor confidence in the company’s rising prospects.Cisco’s rally has been supported by solid earnings results, strong gross and operating margin expansion and an upbeat outlook for the coming quarter. This momentum also reflects the company’s aggressive push into AI, a consistent rollout of innovative products and overall operational strength.A major catalyst for Cisco’s stock performance is its deepening involvement in AI-focused infrastructure. In its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, the company announced that AI-related infrastructure orders exceeded $600 million, pushing the year-to-date total beyond $1 billion. These orders are coming from some of the biggest players in cloud computing, including Meta, and reflect a growing demand for AI-optimized networks.Beyond AI, Cisco is also seeing robust demand across its broader product portfolio. Networking product orders grew double-digits, driven by web-scale infrastructure, enterprise routing, switching and industrial IoT products. The company’s innovation pipeline continues to accelerate, with deeper integration of security into its networking products.Security has become another key pillar of Cisco’s strategy. The $28 billion acquisition of Splunk is already paying off, highlighted by a landmark deal with a major financial institution like Nvidia and Microsoft. Cisco also launched new products like Secure Access, XDR and Hypershield, which gained traction by adding over 370 new customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2025..Juniper Networks JNPR and Arista Networks ANET are intensifying competition in enterprise and cloud networking, challenging Cisco’s long-held dominance with AI-driven innovation and infrastructure solutions.Juniper is unique in its high-performance routing, switching and integrated security, powered by its Junos OS and SDK for automation and extensibility.

In the absence of federal regulation, states over the past few years have enacted dozens of new laws — curbing deepfakes, protecting artists, banning algorithmic discrimination — aimed at preventing harms from the nascent technology..The ban is a top priority for big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc. as well as venture capital firms, such as Andreessen Horowitz, which backs smaller but still powerful players.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-titans-struggle-rising-clout-140633970.html,"```json

Quantum computers powerful enough to crack modern encryption. Secretive defense contractors building out technologies inspired by extraterrestrial life forms. Over the past few months, issuers including Roundhill Investments, KraneShares and Themes have designed products aiming to capture these out-of-this-world ideas — betting investors will buy the story before the science well and truly arrives..It’s the kind of thematic-investing pitch popularized by Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management — which also touts the humanoid sector — in the pandemic: Bold claims, long timelines, uncertain payoffs. Only this time round, there are even fewer corporate-earning stories, industry benchmarks or valuation models to anchor the trade. Yet with the AI story now firmly embedded into mainstream portfolios, issuers are looking for first-mover advantages to market the next novel tech story..“ETF issuers are always looking for the next frontier. Themes evolve quickly, AI was a hit, but the space is now crowded with products. The race is on to discover the next big idea,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Some may sound far-fetched today, but we’ve said that before about themes that are now hits. What seems niche now could be a success tomorrow.”.Among the most eye-catching is the humanoid sector, which Morgan Stanley sees ballooning into a $5 trillion market by 2050. In early June, KraneShares launched KOID — a fund targeting companies behind people-like robots. Roundhill, meanwhile, is preparing a competing humanoid ETF..Dave Mazza, the CEO of Roundhill, is behind that actively managed fund, which is set to launch on Thursday under the ticker HUMN with a focus solely on the companies designing and building humanoids. He sees the theme playing out as early as the next six months, as advances in AI and robotics converge.

Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy – We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus. What a difference this would make. If things later change to the negative, increase the Rate. I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over.

During a recent conversation at Stripe’s Sessions conference, Zuckerberg addressed a persistent concern about AI’s impact on employment:.""People are very fixated on this notion of, 'Oh, AI is going to be able to replace people's jobs.'"".Zuckerberg’s perspective is shaped by his experience leading one of the world’s largest technology companies through multiple waves of innovation and disruption. While acknowledging that AI is increasingly effective at automating tasks across various business functions, he believes the technology’s most profound impact will be in amplifying human potential rather than simply eliminating roles..The CEO explained that AI is making it easier for entrepreneurs and small teams to launch and scale companies by automating non-core activities such as marketing, payments, and operational logistics. This allows founders and employees to focus more on their core ideas and creative strengths, rather than being bogged down by ancillary tasks..“There’s the version of this where everyone at your company just gets a ton more leverage,” Zuckerberg said, highlighting his excitement about the opportunities AI creates for building companies in fundamentally new ways..Zuckerberg’s optimism is rooted in Meta’s own experience leveraging AI to improve its products and services. The company has deployed AI-driven tools to automate advertising, personalize user experiences, and streamline content moderation. These advances have allowed Meta to operate more efficiently and innovate faster, while also enabling businesses that use its platforms to achieve greater reach with fewer resources..The broader context of Zuckerberg’s comments reflects ongoing debates in the tech industry and among policymakers about AI’s impact on the workforce. While some studies and experts predict significant job displacement, others argue that new technologies historically create more jobs than they destroy, often in fields that did not previously exist. Zuckerberg’s view is that AI will follow this pattern, unlocking new opportunities for entrepreneurship and productivity..His authority on the subject comes from decades of experience navigating technological disruption. Since founding Facebook in 2004, Zuckerberg has overseen the company’s adaptation to mobile computing, social networking, and now, the era of AI. His focus on empowering teams and individuals aligns with Meta’s broader mission to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-very-fixated-notion-ai-115629830.html,"```json

Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms each have market capitalizations of more than $1 trillion, and tend to dominate their markets and investors' attention..Don't get me wrong: All of those are solid investments. But it's also a good strategy for tech investors to look elsewhere for new opportunities. After all, companies like Palantir Technologies were barely a blip on the radar just a few years ago. But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems. And each has a market cap of less than $100 billion -- which means there's plenty of room for further growth and profit for your portfolio..DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) got its start in 2013, but it's one of those companies that really took off during the pandemic, as people were much more interested in eating at home than venturing out. That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives..The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns..DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms..If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). Sea is a multifaceted technology company involved in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial services. Its Shopee business is a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, and also operates in Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's Monee segment (formerly called SeaMoney) provides financial services in Southeast Asia and Brazil.

It's using the technology to keep users engaged for longer periods of time, to launch new features, and to help businesses improve conversions with better advertising content. Plus, the company has developed one of the most popular open-source large language models (LLMs) in the world, called Llama. Read on..Over 3.4 billion people use Meta's social networks every single day. The company generates the majority of its revenue by selling advertising slots to businesses on those platforms, so more users equals more money in the door. But keeping each user online for longer periods of time is another valuable way to attract more advertising dollars, and AI is playing a massive role in boosting engagement..Meta's AI algorithm learns what each user likes to see, and it feeds them more of it. That's why your content feed on Facebook and Instagram is constantly filled with photos and videos you're interested in -- if you regularly watch videos of golden retrievers, Meta's AI algorithm will work overtime to show you more of them. Before you know it, a quick scroll has turned into an hour-long session..In fact, during his conference call with investors for the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI-driven recommendations resulted in a 7% increase in the amount of time users were spending on Facebook over the previous six months, and a 6% increase on Instagram..But advertising on platforms with lots of users and high engagement doesn't guarantee success because businesses need to create ad content that attracts interest, fosters interactions, and ultimately converts. Meta thinks AI can do this better than the average small business operator, so it's rolling out new tools to automate as much of the process as possible..Zuckerberg says one day in the future, businesses will simply tell Meta their objectives (like boosting sales or brand awareness) and their budget, and AI will autonomously handle everything from crafting the ad creative to targeting the appropriate audience.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-stock-buy-now-081200244.html,"```json

To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia..Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage..Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares..Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-070000205.html,"```json

Analysts have projected that the AI market will be worth trillions of dollars in the next five to 10 years. If you have $3,000, that's more than enough to invest in a few of the companies set to capitalize on the AI boom..For the best results, you may want to split your money among companies that each focus on different parts of the AI market. Here are three options to consider..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. It creates AI chips that tech companies use in their data centers, similar (but not entirely identical) to GPU maker Nvidia..Semiconductor stocks are an excellent AI investment opportunity. They provide the hardware necessary to run the most advanced AI models, and the semiconductor industry is growing to meet rising demand. The global semiconductor market grew by 19.7% in 2024, and is projected to grow another 11.2% in 2025..Broadcom stands out from the competition because it makes customizable chips called AI accelerators. Some of the major hyperscalers, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms, use Broadcom to make their own custom AI chips. It's rumored that OpenAI is another company partnering with Broadcom for this reason. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan says that it has three hyperscaler customers expected to deploy 1 million AI accelerators in 2027..Broadcom is on the pricey side, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38. That's common for AI companies, and based on Broadcom's momentum and earnings projections, this could still be a good time to invest..It beat expectations in its second fiscal quarter of 2025, with revenue rising 20% year over year to $15 billion. AI revenue was particularly impressive, growing 46% year over year to $4.4 billion. Tan expects that to grow even more in the third quarter to $5.1 billion..Tech conglomerate Alphabet is integrating AI throughout its products and services. Perhaps the most well-known example is the AI overviews that now sit at the top of Google search results. Alphabet has also added AI tools to Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, etc.), launched its Gemini chatbot, and uses AI for its self-driving car project, Waymo.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-3-000-3-artificial-000000425.html,"```json

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on PINS. Pinterest, Inc.'s share was trading at $34.00 as of June 23rd. PINS’s trailing and forward P/E were 12.50 and 19.01 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Photo by Szabo Viktor on Unsplash.Pinterest (PINS) is gaining attention as a potential standout in the social media space, offering compelling upside despite investor skepticism. While its revenue of $3.7 billion in 2024 is smaller than expected, Pinterest’s niche positioning and unique user base provide an avenue for advertisers seeking alternatives to Meta and Google..Analysts project ~15% annual revenue growth, though there are questions around the platform’s ability to scale meaningfully beyond its current user ceiling. Pinterest reported $1 billion in EBITDA at a 28% margin in 2024, and analysts forecast moderate expansion to 33% by 2027. The stock’s standout trait is its robust free cash flow profile—$1.2 billion is projected for 2025, reflecting over 90% conversion of EBITDA to FCF, a key metric for long-term compounding..Valuation appears attractive, with Pinterest trading at 16x 2026E EPS and just 13x 2027E, despite a net-cash balance sheet. On an EV/FCF basis, the multiple is even lower—14x and under 12x for 2026 and 2027, respectively, suggesting discounted investor expectations. The prevailing market view seems to be that Pinterest has carved out a viable niche but lacks the product strength to materially gain share in the competitive ad tech space..Yet if Pinterest meets its estimates and trades at a reasonable 19x multiple in 2027, the stock could reach $49, offering ~44% upside. The case hinges on its ability to deliver 15%+ revenue growth and 30%+ EBITDA margins, which would validate its position as a high-quality compounder overlooked by the market..Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Pinterest, Inc. by Dan in September 2024, which highlighted Gen Z-led user growth, its Amazon partnership, and intent-driven ad monetization. The company’s stock price has appreciated by approximately 11.6% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as fundamentals remain strong. Simeon McMillan shares a similar view but emphasizes Pinterest’s free cash flow strength and valuation discount..Pinterest, Inc.  is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 86 hedge fund portfolios held PINS at the end of the first quarter, which was 73 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of PINS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The reason for the mass bans is not yet known, though many suspect that faulty AI-based moderation could be to blame.","After a wave of mass bans affecting Instagram and Facebook users alike, Meta users are now complaining that Facebook Groups are also being impacted by mass suspensions. According to individual complaints and organized efforts on sites like Reddit to share information, the bans have affected thousands of groups both in the U.S. and abroad and have spanned various categories..When reached for comment, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed the company was aware of the issue and was working to correct it..“We’re aware of a technical error that impacted some Facebook Groups. We’re fixing things now,” he told TechCrunch in an emailed statement..The reason for the mass bans is not yet known, though many suspect that faulty AI-based moderation could be to blame..Based on information shared by affected users, many of the suspended Facebook groups aren’t the type that would regularly face moderation concerns, as they focus on fairly innocuous content like savings tips or deals, parenting support, groups for dog or cat owners, gaming groups, Pokémon groups, groups for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, and more..Facebook Group admins report receiving vague violation notices related to things like “terrorism-related” content or nudity, which they claim their groups haven’t posted..While some of the impacted groups are smaller in size, many are large, with tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of users..Those who have organized to share tips about the problem are advising others not to appeal their group’s ban, but rather to wait a few days to see if the suspension is automatically reversed when the bug is fixed..Currently, Reddit’s Facebook community (r/facebook) is filled with posts from group admins and users who are angry about the recent purge. Some report that all the groups they run have been removed at once. Some are incredulous about the supposed violations — like a group for bird photos with just under a million users getting flagged for nudity..Others claim that their groups were already well moderated against spam — like a family-friendly Pokémon group with nearly 200,000 members, which received a violation notice that their title referenced “dangerous organizations,” or an interior design group that served millions, which received the same violation..At least some Facebook Group admins who pay for Meta’s Verified subscription, which includes priority customer support, have been able to get help. Others, however, report that their groups have been suspended or fully deleted..It’s unclear whether the problem is related to the recent wave of bans impacting Meta users as individuals, but this seems to be a growing problem across social networks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-group-admins-complain-mass-203633455.html,"```json

(META) on Rebound Capital’s Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on META. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)'s share was trading at $694.14 as of 11th June. META’s trailing and forward P/E were 27.46 and 27.78 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..A marketing manager in a boardroom making decisions about the company's social media management platform..Meta’s dramatic fall from grace in 2022, with its market cap plunging from nearly $1 trillion to just $230 billion, was driven by a confluence of cyclical and secular challenges. Internally, Meta reported its first-ever drop in daily active users and doubled down on a costly, uncertain Metaverse pivot, pouring nearly $30 billion into Reality Labs with little return..Externally, Apple’s iOS privacy changes slashed Meta’s ad targeting ability, costing an estimated $10 billion in lost ad revenue, while competition from TikTok siphoned user engagement. Macro conditions further compounded these issues, as rising interest rates and recession fears pressured advertisers and drove investors toward safer assets. Revenue declined 1% and net income fell 41% in 2022, but even in this difficult environment, Meta’s core business remained robust..The Family of Apps delivered a 37% operating margin on $114.5 billion in revenue, supported by a fortress balance sheet with $30 billion in net cash and $27.9 billion in buybacks. While the capital allocation into the Metaverse raised concerns, Zuckerberg’s strategic pivot in late 2022 marked a turning point. The “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 brought aggressive cost cuts, two major layoffs, and a $40 billion buyback..By year-end, OpEx came in 8% below plan, margins improved, and Reels achieved $10B+ ARR. Threads launched, monetization accelerated, and management regained credibility. The comeback culminated in early 2024 with Meta’s first dividend, a $50 billion buyback authorization, and a single-session market cap gain of $200 billion..Investors who endured the pain were rewarded with a 400% rebound—proof of resilience, strong fundamentals, and a responsive management team. The rebound was so spectacular that even if you bought the stock in March 2024, you would still have doubled the return of investing in the S&P 500..Previously, we highlighted a bullish thesis on Meta Platforms (META) by LongYield on Substack in May, focusing on its strong Q1 results, AI-driven ad innovation, and high-margin growth. The stock price has appreciated by roughly 21% since our recent coverage. Rebound Capital complements this thesis with a broader narrative of Meta’s dramatic 2022–2024 rebound, emphasizing management’s strategic agility, cost discipline, and capital returns, together painting a picture of a resilient, undervalued tech leader with long-term upside.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-inc-meta-bull-173640725.html,"```json

83,2025-06-25 01:07:00,Meta Launches Xbox Edition of Its Quest VR Headset,Meta's looking to make a bigger push into VR gaming.,"This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Meta’s looking to boost the appeal of VR gaming, with a new Xbox-branded Meta Quest bundle, created in partnership with Microsoft, which will enable gamers to get their hands on a limited edition, Xbox-themed Quest headset..As you can see in this example, the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition comes in a sleek-looking black colorway, and includes a matching Xbox controller in the set. .But not an Xbox itself. .As per Meta:.“Today, Meta and Xbox are teaming up to unveil the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition - a celebration of Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) on Quest. Retailing for $US399.99, this limited edition bundle includes a custom 128GB Meta Quest 3S in signature Xbox Carbon Black and Velocity Green with matching Touch Plus controllers, a limited edition Xbox controller, an Elite Strap, and a 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.”.So, to clarify, the regular price of a Meta Quest 3S headset is $US299, while an Xbox One controller costs around $US49.99. Add to this the 3-months of Xbox Live access ($US24.99) and it’s not actually a bargain, in terms of price. But the color looks cool, and you can bet that some Xbox fans will be keen to purchase the limited edition design, as part of their gaming set-up..And as Meta points out, Meta Quest already integrates Xbox functionality, effectively: .“Meta Quest is an Xbox - and has been for a couple of years now, ever since we partnered with Microsoft to launch the Xbox app on Quest. Put on your Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, and you can play hundreds of Xbox games like South of Midnight, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Avowed, and Towerborne on a larger-than-life screen. And of course, you can play all the incredible immersive experiences across gaming and entertainment from the Meta Horizon Store.”.Yeah, in terms of value, it’s not actually that great of a package, but really, the pitch here is not that this is a great deal, as such, but rather that this is a better alternative than buying an Xbox..Which seems like a bit of a conflict for Microsoft, but presumably, it's getting a fair share of revenue from the collaboration..And again, it’s another means for Meta to boost the appeal of its VR headset with the gaming community, by integrating its advanced headset with Xbox more directly, and inviting gamers to accessorize their set-up with a VR unit. .And while Meta has broader ambitions for its VR experience, gaming remains a key gateway for adoption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-launches-xbox-edition-quest-170738470.html,"```json

The company's proprietary supercomputers, full suite of AI solutions, and competitive pricing mean that revenues will soar in the coming years.","Zacks Rank #3 stock Nebius Group (NBIS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure company that offers its customers a full-stack AI solution. Currently, Nebius AI is benefitting from the hottest and fastest-growing area on Wall Street – AI infrastructure. Essentially, the company provides the backbone and compute power for companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) that are building the most powerful AI systems in the world, like the ChatGPT and Gemini large language models (LLMs). Building and training these complex, technologically advanced AI systems requires a massive amount of computer power and equipment..In simple terms, Nebius is akin to a specialized electricity company, but rather than providing power, the company provides the lightning-fast computer power and technology needed for AI. However, what makes Nebius special and unique is how they offer their products:.·       NBIS has its own supercomputers: Nebius builds and operates its own data centers that it fills with the latest and most advanced graphic processing units (GPUS). In other words, rather than building their own data centers and setting up the complex AI technology themselves, big tech companies like Microsoft can rely on NBIS data centers and use them as a service..·       NBIS has competitive pricing: Because Nebius is focused solely on AI solutions, the company can provide more competitive pricing than general cloud providers, for example..·       NBIS offers supplemental products: Nebius’s laser-focus on AI also allows the company to offer a full suite of products that extend beyond just compute power. Its add-on software solutions make running AI models simpler and more efficient..Nebius AI builds proprietary hardware like servers and racks, allowing it to vertically integrate its business. In addition, NBIS has partnered with Nvidia (NVDA) (the top AI chip company) to leverage the industry-best Nvidia GPUs and access powerful ‘GPU clusters’ to run AI models at scale. Meanwhile, Nebius also has an essential partnership with big tech juggernaut Meta Platforms (META). Meta leverages NBIS technology to train its Llama large language model. While the details of the partnership are under wraps, investors should not underestimate the significance of the partnership. META and its iconic CEO Mark Zuckerberg not only spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI, Zuckerberg is so serious about AI that recent reports claim that he has been poaching top AI talent from other AI leaders, offering staggering $100 million pay packages as incentive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nebius-ai-infrastructure-leader-165900988.html,"```json

To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia.   .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage.. .Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares.. .Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-vs-nvidia-ai-stock-161500955.html,"```json

Specifically, Zuckerberg explained how these companies often restrict Meta’s ability to innovate within their ecosystems, citing Apple’s iMessage as a powerful “lock-in” that discourages users from switching platforms. This competitive environment has influenced Meta’s decision to invest heavily and early in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, even before the market is fully mature..Zuckerberg says the strategy is actually working, as shown by the latest release of Apple Vision Pro, which largely failed due to its poor design, $3,500 price tag, and lack of relevant features or utility. Zuck touted this win, saying “our VR products are better and 10 times cheaper than Apple.”.Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Says the Technology They’re Developing Will ‘See What You See and Hear What You Hear’.The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..'Record-Shattering': Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Has Now Paid $101 Billion in Cumulative Federal Income Tax.Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox.

His vision for the “metaverse” — a persistent, shared virtual space — has driven Meta’s substantial investments in VR and AR, despite significant financial losses in Reality Labs, which have exceeded $60 billion since 2020..Zuckerberg’s assertion about Meta’s VR products being superior and more affordable than Apple’s fits within his broader strategy to democratize access to emerging technologies. By prioritizing cost efficiency and user experience, Meta aims to overcome the entrenched ecosystems of Apple and Google, which dominate mobile platforms and often limit third-party innovation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vr-products-better-10-times-152428433.html,"```json

This marks the first time that the courts have given credence to AI companies’ claim that fair use doctrine can absolve AI companies from fault when they use copyrighted materials to train large language models (LLMs)..This decision comes as a blow to authors, artists, and publishers who have brought dozens of lawsuits against companies like OpenAI, Meta, Midjourney, Google, and more. While the ruling is not a guarantee that other judges will follow Judge Alsup’s lead, it lays the foundation for courts to side with tech companies over creatives..These lawsuits often depend on how a judge interprets fair use doctrine, a notoriously finicky carve-out of copyright law that hasn’t been updated since 1976 — a time before the internet, let alone the concept of generative AI training sets..Fair use rulings take into account what the work is being used for (parody and education can be viable), whether it’s being reproduced for commercial gain (you can write “Star Wars” fan fiction, but you can’t sell it), and how transformative a derivative work is from the original..Companies like Meta have made similar fair use arguments in defense of training on copyrighted works, though before this week’s decision, it was less clear how the courts would sway..In this particular case, Bartz v. Anthropic, the group of plaintiff authors also brought into question the manner in which Anthropic attained and stored their works. According to the lawsuit, Anthropic sought to create a “central library” of “all the books in the world” to keep “forever.” But millions of these copyrighted books were downloaded for free from pirate sites, which is unambiguously illegal..While the judge granted that Anthropic’s training of these materials was a fair use, the court will hold a trial about the nature of the “central library.”.“We will have a trial on the pirated copies used to create Anthropic’s central library and the resulting damages,” Judge Alsup wrote in the decision. “That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-judge-sides-anthropic-lawsuit-151718562.html,"```json

However, at a little over 16 times estimated profits, its valuation is a fraction of Tesla’s at 150 times, a multiple based heavily on expectations for a service that investors had been waiting years for..“People are underestimating Waymo in a pretty significant way, while overestimating Tesla,” said Samuel Rines, macro strategist at WisdomTree. Alphabet’s valuation “assigns basically zero value to Waymo even though it has the best tech, it is already operating, and it has deals with OEMs,” referring to original equipment manufacturers..Alphabet rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla shares were little changed..Investor excitement about self-driving technology is rooted in the vast size of the potential market. Annual ride-hailing sales could exceed $325 billion by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. As much as $20 billion of that could come from robotaxis, analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a research note on Monday..Waymo currently offers self-driving paid rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and San Francisco and just began offering trips through Uber Technologies Inc.’s platform in Atlanta, with Miami and Washington expected next year. Last week, Waymo applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City, sending Uber and Lyft Inc. shares lower..Waymo was valued at more than $45 billion in October, putting it roughly on par with the market capitalizations of both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. It’s a drop in the bucket for Alphabet, however, with a market value of more than $2 trillion..Still, Waymo is an increasingly attractive part of Alphabet’s portfolio and should offer “long-term upside” for shareholders, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-lacks-tesla-stock-buzz-101252621.html,"```json

It's the technological innovation of our age -- one that will alter the course of humanity for the foreseeable future..Want definitive proof? Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly willing to pay $100 million in bonus packages to poach top AI talent from rivals, personally sending WhatsApp messages to hundreds of researchers and hosting them at his homes to close deals. When one of the world's richest CEOs abandons his executive suite to become his company's chief recruiter, you know you're witnessing something far more substantial than dot-com era vaporware..While everyone obsesses over which company will build the first superintelligence, the smartest money is quietly accumulating positions in the companies that will profit regardless of which company wins. Think of it this way: During the California Gold Rush, the prospectors went bust -- but the folks selling picks and shovels got rich..Today's AI revolution follows the same playbook. The following five stocks are perfectly positioned to profit from every dollar spent in this technological arms race..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) gets all the AI chip headlines, but the real story is its transformation into a full-stack AI computing company. While investors fixate on quarterly graphics processing unit (GPU) sales, Nvidia is quietly building the computing platform for the next generation of humanoid robots, agentic AI systems, and autonomous vehicles..The company's chips and software are becoming the preferred choice for developers building everything from factory robots to self-driving cars. The robotics market alone could reach $375 billion by 2035, yet Wall Street still values Nvidia like a semiconductor company selling commodity chips..Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is deploying 750,000 robots across its fulfillment centers, but that's just the beginning of its automation journey. Its next-generation AI-powered robots are designed to work alongside human employees, handling the most physically demanding tasks while freeing workers to focus on higher-value activities.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-ai-stocks-every-investor-111500156.html,"```json

Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares.  Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such as Nvidia and Amazon -- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed.","Only one ""Magnificent Seven"" company hasn’t yet split its stock..Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such as Nvidia and Amazon -- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed. But one AI stock, in particular, hasn't ever launched a split, and that's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Here's why this company, which has soared more than 300% over the past three years, could be next on the list..Before diving in, though, let's take a closer look at how and why companies split their stocks. These operations are used to lower the price of each individual share -- so companies generally do this after their stock prices have made significant gains and have arrived at a price that may discourage some investors from buying..For example, as stocks approach the $1,000 mark, even if valuation looks fine, they still may be viewed as expensive by certain investors. And investors who don't have access to fractional shares might find it difficult to buy a stock at these levels. These two elements could weigh on demand for the company's stock, limiting its potential for further gains..Companies split their stock by simply offering more shares to current holders -- the number of shares depends on the ratio of the split. So, for example, in a 10-for-1 split, if you originally held one share, you would hold 10 post-split. The value of each share would be worth less than it was prior to the operation, but the total value of your holding would remain the same..All of this means a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about the company or the stock, but it does make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy..As mentioned, Nvidia and Amazon completed splits, along with other technology giants such as Broadcom and Alphabet. And, over time, almost every member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- a group of tech stocks that led the stock market higher last year -- has completed a stock split. The exception is social media and AI powerhouse Meta..Like its fellow Magnificent Seven players, Meta has delivered impressive stock performance -- and actually is the second-best performer over the past three years, after AI chip giant Nvidia..Today, Meta shares trade for more than $600, outpacing the rest of these star tech stocks -- Microsoft is the closest, with shares trading for about $470.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-watch-ai-stock-081000729.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .With Meta making a bigger push to lure sports communities over to its apps, X is looking to fight back, by adding various new sports engagement options which it hopes will enhance game day interaction in the app..X has been working on this since November last year, when it launched its new “NFL Portal” element, which is designed to make it easier for users to stay up to date with key discussions around live NFL matches..As you can see in this example, the NFL Portal brings together posts from NFL teams, as well as key commentators, while also providing access to game schedules, live scores and stats..X added the same for NBA matches in April this year:.And in the last week, X has also added some additional sports engagement elements, including updated share cards for sports games, and new score tracker notes on relevant posts..I mean, maybe you wouldn’t want that, if you were hoping to catch the replay, but if you’re looking up the event hashtag, you’re likely fine with the score being spoiled..X users can also dock conversations about a live match, so they can keep on top of the discussion while X’s video feed provides another means to share highlights in-stream. .X will be hoping that this enhanced focus on sports discussion will prompt more engagement, and keep its top sports communities from migrating to other platforms instead..Because as noted, Meta’s making a push for this audience as well. .Meta already has a deal in place with the UFC, which will see exclusive, live content shared to Threads, while Threads now also has its own live score displays for in progress sporting events, which is a first step towards a similar game day hub like X..Meta has also made a specific point of highlighting that sports discussion is rising fast in the app, with some sports-related communities growing by millions in a matter of months. And amid the recent NBA Finals fanfare, Threads also hosted a live chat with ESPN’s Malika Andrews to promote the event..In combination, you can see how Threads is looking to make inroads with this key discussion element, as another effort to put pressure on X. .And given that sports is the biggest topic of discussion on X, that makes a lot of sense:.The fact that X is now looking to add more sports engagement elements, and fast, suggests that Threads likely is making some progress on this front, and building its own sports-based communities, causing engagement challenges for the app. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/x-adds-more-sports-engagement-204954862.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Another aspect of Meta’s recent shift to re-categorize all videos posted to the app (except live-streams) as Reels is that this will also change how Meta counts views for non-Reels clips..Up till the announcement, Meta counted Facebook video views (non-Reels) at 3 seconds of view time, meaning that the video needed to be on-screen and playing for 3-seconds, at least, to register as a view. But now, Meta’s bringing this into line with Reels measurement, with video views to be counted basically as soon as the video begins playing. .Which, as Mondo Metrics chief Nick Cicero points out, means that, now, every major social platform counts a video view after a second..Well except LinkedIn (2 seconds), while regular YouTube video views (everything but Shorts) are still counted at 30 seconds. 30 seconds feels like a more viable measure of attention and engagement, and it also worth noting that most platforms do also provide 2-second and 3-second view counts within their ad metrics, as well as completion rates to provide more context. But it is important for social media managers to understand what that view count data actually means, and represents, in real world terms. .To keep you up to speed, Nick Cicero has published this updated overview of how each platform measures a view for quick reference..You can get more info on each at:.Snapchat.Instagram.X.Facebook.TikTok.YouTube.LinkedIn.Or the team from Mondo Metrics can provide more in-depth insight..Because as Cicero notes:.“Views are cheap.

In discussing Meta’s artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, he gave some unique insights into where he thinks AI is heading in general, as well as where he plans to steer the $1.75 trillion tech giant..""On the consumer side, we’re very focused on personal AI. Right more than kind of productivity. So, you know, what is that? It's going to be probably more conversational, probably index a little bit more towards voice, be more personalized,” Zuckerberg said in a recent interview. He continued, “I think people are going to want a system that gets to know them well and that kind of understands them in the way their feed algorithms do and honestly that they don't have to ramp up from scratch because it's already connected to some of that stuff.”.Is Tesla a Buy or Sell as TSLA Stock Zooms on Austin Robotaxi Launch?.The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..These 3 Stocks Have Been Hot in 2025.

Sign up now!.While smartphones would probably be the ideal way to integrate AI into a user’s life, Zuckerberg is pursuing a different approach entirely: Glasses. It doesn’t seem like the tech mogul believes smartphones are going away, but rather that glasses will be the next frontier of wearable technology. Smartphones are likely too competitive, and Meta would be vastly too late to the game. Even giants like Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are still struggling to break into the smartphone market, despite investing billions of dollars and dedicating years of work. Instead, Meta is by far the leader in the wearable glasses space, and can carve out a niche for itself while it looks to break into the hardware industry and find some real-life use cases for its AI ventures..Zuckerberg laid out his vision for the future, saying: “As you walk through the world, and you have your glasses, glasses are kind of the perfect form factor for AI, because you let an AI see what you see and hear what you hear and talk to you throughout the day, it should all just kind of get to know you. And it shouldn't be like every time you do a query, you're just starting from scratch and you need to provide it all of the details."".This philosophy is rooted in Zuckerberg’s long-standing emphasis on user-centric design and his belief in technology’s ability to enhance daily life. Under his leadership, Meta has evolved from a social networking platform into a technology conglomerate at the forefront of AI, virtual reality, and wearable devices.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-mark-zuckerberg-says-technology-182139982.html,"```json

102,2025-06-24 00:33:00,"I Predict This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Will Crush Expectations",Nvidia could sizzle as the other six stocks slump.,"Nvidia has grown like a weed over the past decade..It continues to dominate the booming AI chip market..It still looks reasonably valued relative to its growth potential..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla -- have all generated impressive returns for their long-term investors. All seven stocks are included in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, and they often drive the market's performance with their size, growth, and influence..But after years of big gains, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their luster. Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which is vulnerable to high tariffs, competition, and supply chain constraints. Amazon faces stiff competition from cheaper cross-border competitors, Alphabet's Google is being slammed by antitrust regulators and struggling to keep pace with OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) services, and Microsoft might be headed for an ugly breakup with OpenAI as the AI start-up openly rebels against its top investor. As for Tesla, Elon Musk's divisive actions are likely driving away its potential customers in the saturated EV market..Meta and Nvidia face fewer near-term headwinds than the other five stocks. However, Meta generates nearly all of its revenue from ads, and its growth could slow down as the global economy cools off. Nvidia certainly isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but the secular expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset a lot of that pressure. So looking ahead, I believe Nvidia will continue to shatter Wall Street's expectations and outperform the other Magnificent Seven stocks for the foreseeable future..Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. It designs its own chips, but it outsources its manufacturing to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. With that ""fabless"" model, Nvidia doesn't need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade its own foundries or develop the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient manufacturing nodes..Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, which can also be used to mine certain cryptocurrencies. But in its latest quarter, it generated less than 9% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs. A whopping 89% came from its data center GPUs -- which include its older A100 chips and current-gen H100 and H200 chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/predict-magnificent-seven-stock-crush-163300908.html,"```json

The menu included traditional New England staples such as grilled salmon, lobster rolls, New England clam chowder and loukoumades for dessert..“The inaugural meal aboard Massachusetts marks the beginning of countless meals that will sustain the crew as they gear up to integrate this mighty submarine into the fleet,” said Jason Ward, NNS vice president of submarine construction. “We look forward to delivering Massachusetts to the Navy, so that this critical national security asset can do the work of protecting our great nation.”..Photos accompanying this news release are available at https://hii.com/newsroom/..“It's exciting to celebrate another step towards bringing Massachusetts to life,” said Cmdr. Michael Siedsma, commanding officer of the pre-commissioning unit. “The crew has worked very hard to transition to full shipboard operations, and the injection of morale and increased camaraderie that comes with sharing a meal prepared onboard is phenomenal to witness. It’s energizing that we were joined by our sponsor, Sheryl, as well as her husband and son. I am grateful for the time they spent learning about the ship and the sailors who make our mission possible, as well as their continued support.”.“Sharing the first meal with the extraordinary sailors who will soon take Massachusetts to sea was such an honor,” said Sandberg. “Over lunch we listened to their stories, witnessed the pride they carry, and felt the deep sense of purpose that unites them.

Together, they make up the “Prominent 10.""","Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S..It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy..Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%..Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI..But what about China?.Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services..Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years..The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC..E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/move-over-magnificent-7-goldman-094217732.html,"```json

111,2025-06-23 13:00:00,How to avoid finance scams on social media,A significant proportion of 'finfluencers' are actually criminals using you to make money — so here's what to look out for.,"Financial influencers or ""finfluencers"" have always existed, it’s just that while they used to be bank managers, journalists and people’s parents, now they could be anyone with a phone and a TikTok account. Social media has become the go-to resource for investment ideas for a significant number of people aged 18-34..One in five (22%) say they get investment ideas from Instagram, while a similar number get them from Facebook (19%) and Reddit (18%), according to research by Hargreaves Lansdown. Meanwhile, one in six people in this age group get investment ideas from X and the same number from TikTok..Some of these finfluencers will be reliable, regulated experts posting on social media in a professional capacity. However, many will be people who lack the knowledge and experience to give a complete picture, so risk leading investors astray..Read more: Why you can trust an 18-year old with their junior ISA – and how to create one.If you’re seeing this kind of content online, ask yourself whether your expert really knows their onions. It can feel like a social media influencer, operating outside the financial services industry, has uncovered a hack that breaks all the rules of finances to give you a head start. However, they may have misunderstood something — or they’re deliberately misleading you. The same rules apply to us all — higher potential rewards always come with more risk..A significant proportion of finfluencers are actually criminals, using you to make money. Some will post videos showing luxury lifestyles, and encourage people to sign up to a WhatsApp group where they will apparently share the secrets of investing success. Others use deepfakes of well-known people in the industry, including Hargreaves Lansdown founder Peter Hargreaves or celebrities like MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis or entrepreneur Steven Bartlett to get people to sign up to scam WhatsApp groups..These might be ""pump and dump"" schemes, in which the criminals invest in very small stocks, then they put people under pressure to invest too — in order to push the price up. Once the value has risen, the criminals sell up and run, leaving investors with big losses, and in some cases with worthless stocks. Another version of this approach is to persuade you to pay fees or commission in return for their ""tips""..Investment companies proactively identify any scams using their name and contact social media companies to take them down. However, so-called fan pages are more difficult to tackle..Social media companies need to make it easier to stop these fraudsters, but in the interim we need to be alert to the risks. It’s worth knowing that Hargreaves Lansdown founders Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown are not on social media. They don’t have WhatsApp groups and neither does the company. If you see these things, they’re scams.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-avoid-finance-scams-social-media-050001105.html,"```json

That's enough to make a significant difference for your retirement or whatever else you're investing for..With $50,000 to invest, you'll likely want to find stocks that can deliver growth, but with relatively low risk. Luckily, there are a number of stocks available on the market that embody those characteristics. Keep reading to see two of them..Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) may be the best example of a business that can burn through billions in cash on a side project, but is still overwhelmingly successful..Meta has lost more than $60 billion on its metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI)-focused division, Reality Labs. But the success of its advertising business and the growth of its family of apps division has more than made up for it..Over the last three years, the stock is up more than 300%. It's fended off a threat from TikTok with its Reels. Meta's AI tools are also helping the company better monetize its ad inventory and help its advertisers use AI for images and ad copy..Meta effectively has a duopoly in digital advertising with Alphabet, but it's outgrowing its large rival. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 16% to $42.3 billion, and Meta reported an operating profit of $17.5 billion, or an operating margin of 41%..The company benefits from a dream business model where it sells ads on user-generated content, and has more than 3 billion daily active users across its apps, primarily including Facebook and Instagram..Meta's wide-moat advantage in digital advertising and social media isn't likely to go anywhere, and the business should continue to experience solid growth as long as the economy is healthy..Meta is also a top AI competitor. Meta AI's chatbot now has nearly 1 billion users, giving it the biggest user base of any AI platform. The company's deal with Scale AI should also accelerate its AI ambitions..Finally, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27, which looks like a great valuation for a company growing at its pace..Overall, Meta combines solid growth, wide profit margins, a strong competitive advantage, and a good valuation, making it a great stock for a large investment.

Earlier this month, it invested a total of $14.3 billion in Scale AI to take a 49% non-voting stake in the company and bring key personnel into Meta's laboratories. Despite the significant changes this brings to Meta and the industry, it's not what makes the stock a buy today..Artificial intelligence is extremely important to the future of Meta Platforms, and the potential impact of the technology still seems to be underappreciated by the market. Meta's stock price is attractive, and it would be a buy whether it made the move to invest in Scale AI or not..Scale AI provides curated and labeled data sets to frontier model developers for AI training. It can also provide evaluation and help improve reasoning models with the help of human experts. It works with many of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, providing key services to ensure they can put out the best products..Meta's investment includes a commercial agreement to spend $450 million per year on Scale's platform. Meta will likely gain access to proprietary data sets in an industry where good data has become incredibly important. More importantly, though, it brings Scale's founder and CEO Alexandr Wang onto Meta's payroll, where he'll head up a new AI ""superintelligence"" lab..Meta has struggled to attract top talent to its AI labs, and the disappointing results of its latest Llama AI model release have made the talent gap more clear. It reportedly offered huge incentive packages to poach OpenAI employees in an effort to win over talent to catch back up with the competition, but most rejected it. With its investment in Scale, Meta is hoping it can correct that issue..Building a leading-edge model is important for Meta, even though it provides its Llama models to the open-source community, albeit with restrictions for commercial use. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is more interested in the potential the most advanced AI systems could bring to Meta's existing products instead of making a product out of the AI model itself. But to build the best model with the most capabilities, it needs wide adoption from the developer community, and that won't happen if its performance is subpar.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-meta-platforms-massive-14-140500538.html,"```json

As of this writing, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Index are up 2%, up 1%, and down 1%, respectively, year to date.  Jake Lerch (Reddit): 2025 has been an up-and-down year for Reddit stock.","Reddit's revenue stands at an incredible year-over-year growth rate of 61%..AMD’s AI product improvements could inspire a new round of investor interest..Meta Platforms' decision to advertise on WhatsApp unlocks a new revenue stream..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.We're nearly halfway through 2025, and what a ride it's been for the stock market. As of this writing, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Index are up 2%, up 1%, and down 1%, respectively, year to date..So, as attention turns to the second half of 2025, three Fool.com contributing analysts have selected their top buys within the technology sector: Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Here's why..Jake Lerch (Reddit): 2025 has been an up-and-down year for Reddit stock. As of this writing, it's down 13% year to date. However, the stock has been extremely volatile throughout the year. It's been up as much as 37% and down by almost 46%..So, obviously, Reddit isn't a stock for every investor or investment portfolio. That said, growth-oriented investors willing to hold for years might want to take the stock's recent volatility as an opportunity to accumulate shares. .Reddit is a social media stock. It boasts more than 108 million daily average users and is growing fast. As of its most recent quarterly report (for the three months ended on March 31), the company's revenue growth stood at 61%..The company makes money through selling ad space, like its much larger social media rival, Meta Platforms. While Meta's ad ecosystem has existed for more than a decade and now draws in about a half-billion dollars per day, Reddit's ad ecosystem remains in its infancy..This creates a possibility for investors. Meta has already proven that the social media advertising model works -- and works very well. Meta has ridden that model to a staggering market capitalization of $1.7 trillion. Reddit, on the other hand, has a market cap of only $26 billion..In a move that mirrors Meta, Reddit recently announced plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ad tools into its network. This strategy could help marketers increase return on investment (ROI) by improving ad targeting and content. .With its large, increasing user base and blistering revenue growth, there's every reason to think Reddit's long-term prospects remain bright -- and its stock price will rise.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-tech-stocks-second-123000937.html,"{

While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years.  The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years.","Amazon has a clear path toward a $3 trillion market cap through its cloud computing growth and AI investments..While it faces some obstacles, Alphabet has the right collection of businesses to hit $3 trillion in the next few years..The combination of AI and serving ads on WhatsApp and Threads should help drive Meta Platforms to a $3 trillion market cap in the coming years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.While not all have stayed there, there have been three tech giants that have crossed the $3 trillion market cap threshold: Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html,"```json

Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI.  Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead.","Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are all strong plays on expanding AI infrastructure..Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI..Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world we live in, making it a must-invest sector..Let's look at 10 AI stocks to invest in right now..The king of AI, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their fast processing speeds. However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083000803.html,"```json

119,2025-06-22 15:06:00,The Stock Split Announcement All of Wall Street Is Waiting for Is Back on the Table -- and It's Not Netflix or Costco!,This industry-leading business is the only one of its elite peers that hasn't completed a stock split before.,"Investors typically gravitate toward companies announcing and completing forward stock splits..Three brand-name, non-tech stocks have completed forward splits in 2025 -- and there's more to picking out which company is next to split than a high share price..The logical candidate to split its stock next is a cash cow with a sustainable moat whose shares are, once again, within a stone's throw of an all-time high..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Although the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the premier attention-grabber for investors on Wall Street over the last two-plus years, it's far from the only trend responsible for lifting the broader market to new heights..Since 2024 began, the market's major stock indexes have been propelled by some of the most influential businesses announcing and completing stock splits..A stock split allows a publicly traded company the opportunity to cosmetically adjust its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. These changes are superficial in the sense that they don't affect a company's market cap or in any way impact its underlying operating performance..Splits can move a company's share price up or down, but there's a sizable variance in how these two types of splits are perceived by the investing community. Reverse splits, which increase a company's share price, are normally shunned by investors. Reverse splits are often enacted by struggling companies that are attempting to avoid being delisted from a major stock exchange..In comparison, investors typically love public companies that complete forward splits, which are designed to lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who can't buy fractional shares through their brokers. The businesses undertaking forward splits usually have rich histories of recurring profitability..While three brand-name businesses have taken the plunge and become the latest stock-split stocks this year, the split announcement that all of Wall Street is waiting for is officially back on the table..Last year, more than a dozen high-profile companies announced a split, and a number of these companies were high-growth AI stocks, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Super Micro Computer, and Palo Alto Networks..The ""Class of 2025"" stock-split stocks all come from outside the tech sector..Wholesale industrial and construction supplies company Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST) was the first to cross the proverbial finish line by completing a 2-for-1 forward split after the close of trading on May 21. This was the ninth time since Fastenal's initial public offering in 1987 that it's completed a forward split, and it's a clear indication that the company's strong cyclical ties and on-site innovations are helping to strengthen its relationship with core clients.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-announcement-wall-street-070600030.html,"```json

From expediting the licensing process for nuclear reactors to examining the potential for nuclear fuel recycling, Trump addressed a range of issues that had hindered the industry's growth for years..With enthusiasm for the nuclear energy industry surging through Washington, many are eager to find stocks that can benefit from the industry's apparent renaissance. For these investors, NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR), Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG), and Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) look like smart choices to power their portfolios..Long gone are the days of massive nuclear power plants that require enormous capital investments and take years to construct. Nowadays, companies like NuScale Power are developing small modular reactors (SMRs) that offer a variety of advantages over conventional nuclear power plants..For one, SMRs require considerably smaller footprints, making them more attractive to project developers, which can scale these reactors to their individual site's needs. And SMRs have improved safety profiles including the ability to shut down and self-cool indefinitely, unlike traditional nuclear power plants. Among other advantages, NuScale's SMRs are built in a factory, which helps to keep costs down and expedite project development..With $491 million in cash and no debt, the company is on strong financial footing, an appealing situation for those looking to balance a quality growth stock that's not rife with risk. To state its competitive advantage over other SMR providers, NuScale Power says that it's the only near-term deployable SMR company with design approval from the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission..While Constellation Energy's portfolio includes about 10 gigawatts (GWs) of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets, it's nuclear energy that represents the lion's share of its generating capacity -- about 21 GWs, or enough power to meet the demands of 16 million homes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-profit-upcoming-nuclear-163300649.html,"```json

Uh, they're, they've got Patrick Mahomes as one of the, the leading spokespeople, uh, who's advertising for this. And, uh, essentially, it's more or less the same as you would get out of the, the Ray-Ban meta sunglasses where you, you can speak to an AI assistant. Uh, you have built-in cameras, you have built-in, uh, speakers, so you, you can listen to music, uh, that directly into your ears. Uh, but it's the, the new style, it's the, the Oakley Houston style, uh, of sunglasses. So you're going to get that, that new look, uh, new design, uh, potentially bringing a, a new market. They're, they're basically saying that this is great for sports. Uh, you can ask things like, if you're golfing, what the wind direction and speed are, uh, and it'll give you the, the information on that so that you can adjust your shot. I don't know anything about golf, so I'll assume that that's good to know. Um, and the, the prices rather high though. The, the limited edition version is starting out at $4.99. And then the regular version, uh, will be $3.99. So that's a lot of cash for some shades, though Oakleys obviously aren't cheap, Ray-Bans aren't cheap either. So, if you want to get the AI element here, and this is all part, uh, of Meta's push into AI smart glasses. The, the thinking here is that Meta is looking for the next type of big product after the smartphone. They are leaning more into smart glasses. Uh, Google, obviously, also in there as well, Apple, reportedly, uh, in there. Some people think that it'll just be, uh, a peripheral for the smartphone, others like Meta seem to think it will be that gadget. So we'll just have to wait and see if more people, uh, go ahead and purchase these types of devices. Meta's already said they sold millions of units of the Ray-Ban, though. So it looks like there is a, a rabid audience and with, with the Oakleys, it might be more, uh, people who are into the, the sports lifestyle that might want to grab these.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.43 billion people daily. Meta Platforms’ growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Shares of Palantir have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+85% vs. +13%). The company’s AI strategy, driven by Foundry, Gotham and AIP platforms, targets government and commercial sectors, enabling real-time insights and operational efficiency. Notable defense projects like Open DAGIR, and AIP boot camps for commercial clients boost customer acquisition. With $5.2 billion in cash, no debt and S&P 500 inclusion, Palantir enjoys strong liquidity, growing revenues and increased investor visibility. However, PLTR's reluctance to pay quarterly dividends is a minus for dividend-seeking investors. Intense competition from tech giants and rising costs amidst a rapidly evolving AI landscape and an elevated valuation also challenge its appeal. (You can read the full research report on Palantir here >>>)Abbott’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+27.8% vs. +8.9%). The company’s pipeline is unlocking new growth opportunities, supporting the company’s positive momentum and strong growth outlook for 2025. Freestyle Libre, Lingo and Libre Rio CGM devices are on a great trajectory.Alinity, the company’s next-generation suite of systems, is a key driver in the core lab diagnostics business. Abbott is optimistic about its latest progress with biosimilars and expects this to significantly boost EPD sales, beginning 2025. Within Nutrition, despite softness in international pediatric arm, Abbott is regaining market share banking on strong Adult Nutrition business. Yet, the significant runoff of COVID-19 testing-related sales is hurting Abbott’s Diagnostics growth. Headwinds such as tough macro conditions and foreign exchange also adds to the worry. (You can read the full research report on Abbott here >>>)Shares of SandRidge Energy have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - U.S. industry over the year-to-date period (+5.3% vs. -1.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $443.18 million has a debt-free balance sheet and $101.1 million cash position back strong self-funding capacity, and $13.6 million in free cash flow in Q1 2025. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 73% to $25.5 million on higher volumes and better gas prices, with gas now 49% of production. Since 2023, $158 million has been returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, with $70 million repurchase capacity remaining. Cherokee drilling supports reserve growth, but capital intensity and WTI/gas price volatility pose risks. Heavy back-half completions, cost inflation, and natural gas legacy underutilization limit efficiency. Large NOLs support tax sheltering but rely on consistent profits; Section 382 limits apply. Reserve quality hinges on Cherokee execution as legacy reserves decline. Commodity swings and execution missteps could pressure cash flow and returns despite strong capital discipline.(You can read the full research report on SandRidge Energy here >>>)CompX International’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Office Supplies industry over the past year (+18.8% vs. -38%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $293.43 million has first-quarter 2025 results highlight resilient core operations and expanding profitability. Security Products maintained a stable gross margin (29.8%) despite OEM softness, supported by gains in government and healthcare markets. Marine Components delivered a 24% year-over-year sales increase and a structural margin uplift to 22.3%, driven by fixed cost leverage and a favorable product mix. The company-wide gross margin rose to 30.2%, fueling a 58% surge in operating income. Cash remained strong at $56.1 million, with no debt and improved inventory efficiency. However, risks include negative operating cash flow due to rising receivables, a 29% drop in interest income and tariff-driven raw material inflation. Continued OEM channel weakness and DSO expansion raise caution, but internal execution and margin tailwinds position CompX for an upside in 2025.(You can read the full research report on CompX International here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuit Inc.

In recent months, Character.AI has added an array of new safety features in light of an active lawsuit, which alleges that one of the company’s chatbots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old Florida boy..Anand comes to Character.AI with experience running advertising products that reached billions of users on Meta’s apps. Previously, Anand served as Microsoft’s head of product management, overseeing user experience on the company’s cloud platform, Azure. Most recently, Anand served as the president of the fintech startup Brex..Anand is taking over Character.AI just over 10 months after Google hired away the startup’s co-founder and CEO, Noam Shazeer, who had previously led core AI teams at the Mountain View giant. At the time, Google also signed a non-exclusive agreement to use Character.AI’s technology..Character.AI’s deal with Google prompted federal regulators to investigate the companies’ relationship over antitrust concerns. It’s one of many reverse-acquihire deals in the AI startup space that’s received regulatory scrutiny, alongside Microsoft’s deal with Inflection.AI..Character.AI has raised more than $150 million in venture funding, largely from Andreessen Horowitz..In a blog post, Anand said one of his first priorities would be making safety filters “less overbearing.” The new CEO noted that the company cares deeply about users safety, but that too often, “the app filters things that are perfectly harmless.”.Anand also said he plans to improve the quality of AI models on Character.AI’s platform, innovate around memory features, and increase transparency around decision making. He says many of these features are coming in the next 60 days..Chatbots that are purely designed for entertainment, which Character.AI specializes in, are growing into a massive market for generative AI — a trend that’s been surprising to many.

In the video above, Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley discusses the reports and Meta's AI talent push..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here..Meta is on a hiring spree and a bid to beef up its artificial intelligence operations. The company is doling out billions of dollars. The latest reporting says the social giant is hiring former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, the CEO of Safe Super Intelligence, which was founded by an alum of OpenAI. The reports come just one week after Meta invested $14.3 billion into scale AI and hired its CEO, Alexander Wong. Joining us now, we've got Dan Howley. Dan, what do we know about this aggressive strategy here for meta to really bolster its AI operations? .Yeah, Brad. This is all about the kind of war for talent ensuring that Meta has the highest level of researchers and just people who are in the know in the AI spaces possible. So, Daniel Gross, obviously he co-founded Super Safe Intelligence with Ilya Sutskever, who also, by the way, co-founded OpenAI. He also was part of AlexNet. That's uh Ilya. That was basically the thing that helped kick off all of the the AI AI model kind of growth out. This guy is prolific. They they wanted to originally according to these reports, buy safe Super Intelligence, but they were rebuffed. And so Meta then went after Gross to to bring him on board. He's doing that as well as Nat Friedman and he's investing or they're investing Meta that is in their own little their little their own portfolio of AI companies. And so this is again, just a bigger part of what we're seeing across the the tech space in AI where companies are going out trying to invest in, if not invest in, then hire some of the biggest names that they can find so that they have the most cutting-edge models available. For Meta, it's part of, you know, one company that's pouring billions of dollars into this. Meta is not happy with the the state of its llama 4 models right now. They're not the only ones that are pouring billions of dollars. Microsoft, uh OpenAI though, that relationship is reportedly souring. Microsoft and OpenAI though say that that's not true. You also have Amazon pouring billions and billions in with their own chips and you have Google with its own investments that are going on. They have Google Deep Mind. They've been moving around some of their pieces there. So, you know, it really is kind of a race to the top to see who can hire who and at what point they'll be able to kind of take the crown from essentially OpenAI still at this point, but with with these investments, you know, Meta clearly trying to say, look, we're we're not going to sit back, we're not going to sit by. We have the the capabilities, we have the the war chest and we're going to go out there and we're going to try to hire whoever we can to try to dethrone OpenAI. .Dan, thanks so much, tracking all the developments and the investments. We're going to continue this conversation in a hot moment. Thanks. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/metas-big-ai-hiring-push-145855745.html,"```json

In a week when a number of AI stocks were moving higher, Innodata was also a winner, as the stock was up 18.2% for the week, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.","Investors seemed to change their mind about the impact of the Meta/Scale AI deal on Innodata..Some of Scale AI's customers reportedly looking for a new data labeling provider..10 stocks we like better than Innodata ›.Shares of Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD), a fast-growing AI stock, were moving higher this week, seemingly on speculation that the company could benefit from Meta Platforms' deal with Scale AI, a competitor to Innodata..Some of Scale AI's customers are reconsidering working with it now that Meta is acquiring a 49% stake in the company, which could open up an opportunity for Innodata, a rival data labeling company, meaning it helps categorize and prepare data for AI models..In a week when a number of AI stocks were moving higher, Innodata was also a winner, as the stock was up 18.2% for the week, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence..Trading volume has risen for Innodata since earlier this month when Wedbush analyst Dan Ives included the stock in his new Dan Ives AI Revolution ETF..Last week, the stock moved lower in response to Meta's deal with Scale AI, as investors seemed to bet that the deal would give its competitor, Scale AI, an edge. However, that thinking seemed to reverse itself this week in response to talk that Alphabet, Scale AI's biggest customer, could be looking for a new data labeling provider..Scale AI is much bigger than Innodata, meaning any customers that leave it could present a big opportunity for Innodata if it can grab that market share..The AI boom has been dominated by large-cap stocks like the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but Innodata shows that there are small-cap stocks capitalizing on the opportunity as well..Innodata is growing quickly with 120% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, and the stock trades at a reasonable valuation. For investors looking for lesser-known AI stock, Innodata is worth a closer look..Before you buy stock in Innodata, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Innodata wasn’t one of them.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.75 per share, indicating a change of +11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.25 points to a change of +5.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.58 indicates a change of +9.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-meta-platforms-130005300.html,"```json

Testing in Meta’s research facilities confirmed the model could guide robots in executing actions like reaching for, lifting, and placing items elsewhere..Three new benchmarks have been released by Meta to help measure the effectiveness of current models in interpreting real-world interactions via video. By sharing these benchmarks, Meta hopes to accelerate progress in the AI research community..Meta underlined the importance of physical reasoning as a cornerstone for equipping AI systems to interact effectively with the tangible world and to attain higher levels of artificial intelligence..While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Some platform operators had questioned whether a user’s age could be reliably established using current technology..The results of the government-backed trial clear the way for the law to come into force by the end of the year. The findings also potentially allow other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s lead as countries around the world grapple with ways to protect children from harmful content online..“Age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective,” the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial said in a statement Friday announcing its preliminary findings..The trial’s project director, Tony Allen, said there were “no significant technological barriers” to stopping under-16s gaining social media accounts. “These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said..Under the new law, digital platforms including Snapchat, Meta-owned Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches..The trial tested a range of methods and technologies, including facial scans, inferring a user’s age based on their behavior, age verification, as well as parental controls. The tests also took into account the ways teenagers might try to circumvent age checks..“We found a plethora of approaches that fit different use cases in different ways, but we didn’t find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,” the trial said in its statement..More than 50 companies participated in the trial, while Apple Inc. and Google, developers of the most popular mobile-phone operating systems, are also contributing, Allen said on a video conference call on Friday..The trial didn’t assess public acceptance for any particular technology or the costs involved. The accuracy of the different methods, for example the margin of error for facial analysis, wasn’t made available.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-moves-closer-011443922.html,"```json

In the first quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ advertising revenues increased 16.2% year over year to $42.3 billion, driven by a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% increase in average ad price. Meanwhile, Alphabet reported revenues of $66.9 billion, up 8.5% year over year, driven by 9.8% growth in Search revenues and 10.3% growth in YouTube ad revenues. According to eMarketer’s latest projection, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are expected to hit revenues of $209.15 billion (Facebook $116.53 billion and Instagram $67.27 billion) and $183.8 billion (Google $189.74 billion and YouTube $19.42 billion), respectively. Higher tariffs are expected to hurt digital ad spending, which is expected to increase at least 1.5% year over year in 2025. Per the latest dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts report, global ad spending is expected to grow 4.9% in 2025 to hit $992 billion, while digital ad spend is anticipated to grow 7.9% to $678.7 billion. This bodes well for both Alphabet and Meta Platforms.However, macroeconomic challenges, including tariffs and increasing regulatory headwinds, are a concern for both. Meta Platforms shares have outperformed Alphabet year to date. While META shares have appreciated 18.8%, Alphabet has dropped 8.5%.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .So, META or GOOGL, which has an edge now?.Meta Platforms’ focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending has been a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META become better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on integrating AI into its platforms — Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Threads — is driving user engagement to boost ad revenues. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement.These factors are expected to drive Meta Platforms’ top-line growth. Our model expects META’s revenues to grow 11.9% year over year in 2025, with advertising revenues (97.6% of revenues) projected to increase 11.8% year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-vs-alphabet-digital-161200830.html,"```json

The news comes after Trump earlier posted on Truth Social that the U.S. is aware of the location of Iran supreme leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei but had opted not to take any action, then saying “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,” the report notes. The White House has previously said it won’t join Israel’s attacks, the report says..TIKTOK BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump intends to sign an executive order sparing TikTok from a law banning or forcing a sale of the social media platform, again delaying a deadline for enforcement of said law, the Wall Street Journal’s Alex Leary reports. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Publicly traded companies in the space include Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Reddit (RDDT) and Snap (SNAP)..STABLECOIN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to set up the first regulatory framework for stablecoins, Axios’ Stephen Neukam reports.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, has voiced support for psychedelics as a potential mental health treatment and Calley Means, a White House adviser, wrote that psychedelics “should be an important public policy priority for the United States”. Additionally, Casey Means, the president’s surgeon general pick, described psilocybin therapy as “one of the most meaningful experiences of life” and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has made positive remarks on the opportunity the substances could hold for veterans.

Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is not above this trend among companies. In fact, Meta Platforms is doubling down. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone all-in on AI, and Wall Street is clearly taking notice. META stock has jumped a notable 45% from its April low of $479.80 per share as investors rally behind the firm’s growing commitment to AI innovation..The latest jolt of momentum comes from Meta’s massive $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, a leading data-labeling startup whose CEO is now joining Meta’s artificial general intelligence (AGI) team. This move comes right after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast to as much as $72 billion.

With several analysts across the Street hiking their price targets for META stock and optimism running high, this AI-fueled rally is hard to ignore. All signs point to Meta remaining a major player in the next tech era — and that makes shares worth a much closer look..Meta Platforms has evolved far beyond its Facebook roots. As the powerhouse behind Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, it still shapes how the world connects. But now the firm is setting its sights on the future of AI. Aside from its latest $14.3 billion bet on Scale AI, Meta has been steadily integrating AI into its core platforms since last year..In April 2025, the company launched Meta AI, a chatbot assistant that has already reached 1 billion monthly active users across its apps. Meta is also gaining traction in hardware, with AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses seeing user growth surge. Finally, the company is working on harnessing AI to supercharge ad targeting and boost user engagement across its entire app family, including Instagram and WhatsApp. META stock drew fresh attention on June 16, climbing 2.8% after the company announced plans to roll out ads within its WhatsApp messaging platform, unlocking a powerful new revenue stream from the app’s massive global user base.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-doubling-down-ai-130002750.html,"```json

Two examples in that department are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG).,"Meta Platforms and Booking Holdings started paying dividends last year..Both are top players in their industries and have tremendous growth prospects..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Growth and income investing may be two distinct styles, but it's possible to combine them by selecting the right stocks. Some corporations have excellent growth prospects and also offer dividend programs that seem at least somewhat reliable..Two examples in that department are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG). Although they are new dividend payers, these market leaders' strong underlying businesses mean they should reward shareholders with consistent dividends for a long time while also capitalizing on significant growth opportunities..Let me explain..Meta Platforms is the leading social media company. It boasts 3.43 billion daily active users across its websites and apps -- that's pretty close to half of the 8 billion people on Earth, a total that includes many who are too young to be on any of the company's platforms. Meta's deep ecosystem makes it an excellent target for advertisers. That's how it generates most of its sales, and that business is still booming..In the first quarter, Meta Platforms' revenue increased by 16% year over year to $42.3 billion. The tech leader's earnings per share (EPS) came in at $6.43, 37% higher than the year-ago period..Here's the good news for investors: Meta Platforms' business is getting even better thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). The company has used AI-powered algorithms to increase engagement on its apps. That means more time spent on Facebook and Instagram, which naturally leads to greater demand for ads and higher revenue. Meta Platforms is also utilizing AI to enhance the ad launch process. Management aims to fully automate this system by the end of 2026..These initiatives could have a significantly positive impact on Meta Platforms' performance in the long run. That's why the company is doubling down with massive investments in AI infrastructure, to the tune of $65 billion this year, according to some reports..The company also has other growth opportunities, including business messaging on WhatsApp. Although economic and trade concerns could continue to impact the stock -- Meta lost some ad revenue from Asia-based retailers in the first quarter -- the company should still deliver strong results thanks to the lucrative opportunities at its disposal..Lastly, Meta Platforms initiated a quarterly dividend last year. The company offers a quarterly dividend of approximately $0.52 per share. Meta's payouts look safe, and although it doesn't have a substantial dividend history yet, investors can benefit from the growth and income it will provide in the next five years and beyond.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-dividend-stocks-growth-oriented-123200320.html,"```json

Altman says Mark Zuckerberg himself is calling staff directly, trying to build a superintelligence dream team to reboot Meta's AI momentum. Despite these high-stakes pitches, Altman insists none of his best people have taken the bait, suggesting Meta's compensation-first approach isn't resonating with those focused on mission and impact..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META..It's not hard to see why Meta is pressing the gas. After a year of AI setbacksdelays to its flagship Behemoth model, backlash over Llama 4's performance claims, and a quiet exodus of senior AI researchers including Joelle Pineauthe company is scrambling to regain its footing. Zuckerberg recently poured $15 billion into Scale AI and hired its co-founder Alexandr Wang, signaling Meta's urgency to close the gap with rivals. But critics point to a deeper issue: even with aggressive spending, Meta's leadership in AI remains in question..Altman called out Meta's strategy bluntly: a ton of upfront guaranteed comp doesn't build long-term innovation. While Meta's compensation packages can reach $3.7 million, OpenAI's own ranges are no small change, with some engineers earning over $1.3 million. Still, the contrast in culture and direction seems to matter more than the money.

Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots). Another option might be to simply expand the Magnificent 7 to a Magnificent 8..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the must-own stocks over the past few years, but we're still a long way away from full AI deployment, so many AI stocks are still worth buying, even at their current levels.","Nvidia is a key supplier in the AI arms race..Nearly all companies source high-tech chips from Taiwan Semiconductor..Meta Platforms' stock is only valued for its legacy ad business..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the must-own stocks over the past few years, but we're still a long way away from full AI deployment, so many AI stocks are still worth buying, even at their current levels..At the top of my shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three each tackle AI in their own way and could be excellent long-term investments..Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed to train and run AI workloads. Its market share dominance in this industry is impressive, with most estimates pegging it at around 90%. Due to unprecedented AI demand, the GPU market has grown massively, and Nvidia's growth has been nothing short of jaw-dropping..Nvidia put up impressive growth figures over the past few years, and although the growth rate is ""slowing,"" it's hard to say that seriously when Nvidia grew revenue 69% year over year to $44 billion in Q1. It also projects it to grow by 50% in Q2, underscoring its strength..As long as there's huge AI demand, Nvidia will be a successful investment. Even with shares trading at 33 times forward earnings, it's about in line with other big tech stocks. However, Nvidia's growth and potential are far greater than many of its big tech peers, which makes it a solid stock to scoop up in June..Taiwan Semiconductor is a huge beneficiary of the massive demand that Nvidia experienced. Nvidia doesn't have the ability to produce its own chips, so it outsources that work to Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia isn't the only company that does this; nearly every big tech company that makes hardware uses chips from Taiwan Semiconductor's factories. This allows Taiwan Semi to stay neutral in the AI arms race, while benefiting from the massive spending..Investing in TSMC isn't picking a winner in the AI arms race; it's a bet that there will be increased AI spending in the future. That seems like a surefire take, so the stock will stay at the top of my buy list for the foreseeable future..Another reason I'm a Taiwan Semi bull is its stock price. Despite benefiting from multiple tailwinds, its stock hasn't achieved a premium valuation. It trades at 22.9 times forward earnings -- the same as the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-091500328.html,"```json

But the mergers and acquisitions market doesn't look as bad as investors feared, thanks to AI.","Wall Street's hopes that 2025 would be a banner year were abruptly cut short after the deals market froze up in April. But as the first half of the year winds down, the mergers and acquisitions market looks not as bad as investors feared..Bankers can thank AI for that..Corporations and private equity firms aren't letting up on their push to capture the artificial intelligence wave, and it's not expected to slow down..""Anything that's sheltered from tariffs in a shifting and evolving sector is where you're going to see the activity right now, and AI is somewhere with that, where there is an absolute race,"" Lucinda Guthrie, head of data provider Mergermarket, told Yahoo Finance..Between the beginning of January and June 17, the number of US-targeted mergers and acquisitions is down by roughly 18%, according to Dealogic. But the total value of all of this year's deals is up 10% compared to the same period in 2024..Much of that added volume is coming from AI-related deals where ""the traditional tech giants all now need to do something,"" Guthrie said, adding that ""although not necessarily clear-cut,"" these same firms have been anticipating a smoother approval process from antitrust regulators..From Meta's (META) $14 billion acquisition of Scale AI last week to the $8 billion purchase agreement Salesforce (CRM) struck with AI-powered data platform Informatica (INFA) in late May, some of the biggest recent deals have been AI-focused. But that was the case even before the Trump administration rolled out sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs on April 2..In fact, seven of the 15 largest US M&A deals so far this year have been about positioning for AI, according to Dealogic data..The two biggest came in March with Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) all-cash acquisition of New York-based cloud security platform Wiz for $32 billion and Japanese firm SoftBank's (9984.T) agreement to lead a $40 billion fundraiser of ChatGPT maker OpenAI..It hasn’t just been software companies either, according to a first-half deals report from PwC. Companies in industrials, utilities, and even private equity are doing AI deals..""Whether it's the advent of AI and the whole ecosystem behind AI, not just the technology and the language models, but the data centers, the energy, getting the energy to the data centers, all the [telecommunications] that goes around that, there's a tremendous amount of change,"" PwC US deals platform leader Kevin Desai said in a Friday press briefing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dealmaking-in-2025-ai-to-the-rescue-090041282.html,"```json

Some focus on valuation. Others prioritize growth potential. A few look for arbitrage opportunities..But there's at least one common denominator among many ultrarich investors these days: They like artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Billionaires are buying these three AI stocks hand over fist..Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stands out as a top pick for several billionaire investors. Izzy Englander might be the most bullish about the tech stock. His Millennium Management hedge fund upped its position in Alphabet by 150.8% in the first quarter of 2025..Ken Griffin is another billionaire hedge fund manager who's enthusiastic about Alphabet stock. His Citadel Advisors increased its stake in the tech giant by 55.7% in Q1. Appaloosa's David Tepper also bought over 128,000 additional shares of Alphabet, bumping up his holding in the stock by 6.8%..What do these billionaire investors like about Alphabet? Its valuation is probably near the top of the list. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 19. None of the other so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks comes anywhere close to such an attractive valuation..Alphabet has also been showing that it's playing to win in the AI space. The company's Google Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks No. 1 overall on the LMArena leaderboard. Google Cloud continues to be the fastest-growing of the top three cloud service providers..There isn't as much of a consensus among billionaire investors when it comes to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management upped its stake in the e-commerce and cloud service giant by 2.7% in Q1 and Englander's Millennium Management boosted its position in Amazon by 5.3%. However, Griffin's Citadel Advisors reduced its Amazon holding by 43.5%. Tepper's Appaloosa trimmed its position in Amazon by 3.5%..But one billionaire loaded up on Amazon stock in the first quarter. George Soros bought more than 101,000 shares, increasing his hedge fund's stake in Amazon by 30.5%.

Artificial intelligence (AI) got the bulk of interest from tech investors in the past couple of years, but it's not the only tech sector with upside potential.","The streaming sector is regaining momentum after a post-pandemic lull..Roku just made a new deal with Amazon and is making progress toward profitability..The Trade Desk is seeing solid growth, but is trading at a significant discount..10 stocks we like better than The Trade Desk ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) got the bulk of interest from tech investors in the past couple of years, but it's not the only tech sector with upside potential..One industry that is delivering solid growth and still has a long runway ahead of it is ad tech. Digital media has transformed advertising. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are the biggest winners in the industry, but there are others benefiting as well, including ad tech companies taking advantage of continued growth in areas such as connected TV, retail media, better ad targeting, and improvements enabled by AI..Keep reading for more details on two of these ad tech stocks that can make investors a fortune..There's no getting around it: Roku's (NASDAQ: ROKU) performance disappointed investors in recent years. Roku's stock price remains down more than 80% from its peak in 2021. That's when the pandemic-driven boom quickly faded as the economy reopened and the streaming industry's surging growth hit a wall..Roku was forced to do several rounds of layoffs, having overspent during the pandemic. But the business and the streaming industry more broadly underwent a reset and are prepared for growth. Netflix's stock soared to an all-time high recently as its ad tier has taken off. Walt Disney is now making a profit in its streaming division, and the stock recently hit a 52-week high, while Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, one focused on studios and the other on streaming..Streaming services appear to be moving past their post-pandemic struggles, and Roku should benefit. Despite the stock's woes, the business continues to deliver solid growth, with revenue up 16% year over year in the first quarter to $1.02 billion, and its bottom line is improving as well. The company also expects to report an operating profit using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) metrics..There are also other signs of building momentum. The stock price jumped on Monday after the company announced an exclusive integration with Amazon's demand side platform, and it's also gaining share of listings on retail sites such as Amazon and Target, a sign that it's probably gaining market share as well..As the leading streaming distribution platform, Roku is well-positioned to capitalize on continued growth in connected TV, and at a market cap of $11 billion, the stock could easily double, triple, or better from here, especially if it hits its profit goal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ad-tech-stocks-could-080000461.html,"```json

(NASDAQ:META) from $690 to $765, maintaining a buy rating. The analyst cited macroeconomic uncertainties that have eased and the growing optimism surrounding the company’s ability to monetize its platform with AI-assisted marketing and innovative ad strategies. This comes amid META’s growing strategic focus on strengthening its AI capabilities to help marketers..On Thursday, June 12, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) finalized an agreement with ScaleAI to acquire a 49% non-controlling stake in it for $14.8 billion. Scale AI, which is a rapidly growing startup specializing in data infrastructure for AI, develops large language models through advanced data labelling services. The deal is META’s second-largest, under which Scale AI’s 28-year-old Alexandr Wang has been brought onboard and will remain on Scale AI’s board..In response to the deal, Google, the biggest client of Scale AI, severed its ties with the company. Meanwhile, there are concerns regarding the deal’s impact on market competition. While META’s non-controlling stake doesn’t require review by U.S. antitrust regulators, it could lead to an investigation if the regulators believe the deal was structured with the intent to harm competition..U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren commented on the deal:.“Meta can call this deal whatever it wants – but if it violates federal law because it unlawfully squashes competition or makes it easier for Meta to illegally dominate, antitrust enforcers should investigate and block it.”.Meta Platforms, Inc.

We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a memo to employees..“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”.Jassy said Amazon is “using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations” for tasks like inventory management and demand forecasting in its delivery system..The CEO said, because of AI, “We’ll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.” The comments were met with backlash from employees..Some of Amazon's corporate employees are facing an order to relocate closer to their managers and teams, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The mandate would require many of them to move across the US to Seattle, Washington DC and other hubs, its sources said..Meanwhile, Amazon and Microsoft have been spending billions to advance their AI efforts. Amazon has consistently reported higher capital expenditures than its fellow Big Tech “hyperscalers” over the past several years, driven by its investments in AI infrastructure.

174,2025-06-19 01:19:00,Facebook will soon roll out support for passkeys on Android and iOS,Passkey logins make it harder for bad actors to remotely access your accounts because they require physical access to your phone.,"Facebook is rolling out support for passkeys on both iOS and Android, the social network announced on Wednesday..Passkey logins make it harder for bad actors to remotely access your accounts because they require physical access to your phone. Unlike standard logins, passkeys use Face ID or Touch ID, a PIN, or a physical security authentication key to validate logins..Passkeys remove the need to rely on username and password combinations, which can be susceptible to phishing and other issues..Facebook says that passkeys will also start rolling out to Messenger in the coming months, and that users will be able to use the same passkey for both services..Passkeys can also be used to autofill payment information when making purchases using Meta Pay, Facebook says..To set up a passkey, you’ll navigate to the new “passkey” option in Accounts Center within the Settings menu on Facebook. Once it’s set up, you can start using your passkey to log in to Facebook on your phone. You’ll still be able to use other authentication methods, such as your password, to access your account so that you can still access the social network when using a device that doesn’t support passkeys..Facebook is one of many tech companies to introduce passkey support in the past year or so. Other big names that have done so include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, PayPal, TikTok, WhatsApp, X, and GitHub.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-soon-roll-support-passkeys-171957499.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .More reassurance for Meta advertisers, with Meta today announcing that it’s been re-accredited by the Media Ratings Council (MRC) for Content-Level Brand Safety, meaning that Meta’s documented processes continue to meet the MRC standards for brand safety and measurement.  .The MRC conducts audits of ad systems to ensure measurement processes meet quality and assurance benchmarks, providing third-party checking to give ad partners more confidence in such..As per the MRC:.“Accreditation indicates that the Measurement Statistics reported for the Service comply with: (1) the Minimum Standards for Media Rating Research, the Enhanced Content Level Context and Brand Safety Guidelines and the Business Partner Qualification requirements of the Invalid Traffic Detection and Filtration Standards Addendum (version 2.0) published by the MRC; the Ad Verification Guidelines published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB); (2) the procedures described in Meta’s answers to the MRC questionnaire; and (3) the procedures described in procedure manuals and textual materials included in reports of the Service..So it’s based on Meta’s documentation, not its actual process, which is a relevant note, while there are also a lot of exclusions noted in the official document. But even so, it provides some level of additional checking, ensuring that Meta's meeting industry standards, as defined by the MRC..Though there was one particularly interesting note in this latest review:.“Misinformation is excluded from accreditation and remains in process of review as Community Notes applied to this category are being assessed.”.So the MRC isn't willing to provide assurance on the prevalence of misinformation on Facebook, Instagram and Threads at this stage, due to Meta’s change in approach in enforcing such, as it moves to allow more speech in its apps..Depending on your perspective, that could be a valid note..In addition to MRC re-accreditation, Facebook and Instagram have also recently received brand safety re-certification from the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) for the sixth consecutive year, while Integral Ad Science has also launched a new contextual category reporting for Meta Platforms, which further expands its measurement reporting across Facebook and Instagram..As per IAS:.“Total Media Quality (TMQ) for Meta, contextual category reporting provides advertisers with the most accurate and actionable brand safety and suitability measurement. TMQ is powered by IAS’s multimedia technology, providing unmatched insight into video content through frame-by-frame analysis of video images, audio, and text to provide the most accurate measurement at scale.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-gains-ad-safety-certifications-170848276.html,"```json

The new target suggests a potential upside of about 14% from current levels..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META..Mathivanan maintained an Overweight rating, noting that Meta's strategy to introduce ads in the WhatsApp Updates tab, while keeping private chats untouched, could unlock a new revenue stream. He pointed to emerging features like Status Ads and Promoted Channels that offer exposure without disrupting the user experience..The analyst highlighted WhatsApp's vast reach of over 3 billion monthly users, with around 1.5 billion daily visits to the Updates tab. Strong engagement metrics, including an 82% daily active user rate and high story view counts, suggest room for ad-driven growth, particularly outside Western markets..Even if ad penetration on WhatsApp reaches just 5% of the level seen on Facebook and Instagram, Mathivanan believes it could have a material impact on earnings by fiscal 2027..Shares of Meta were little changed in recent trading..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-analyst-predicts-big-upside-170138363.html,"```json

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .Facebook’s adding an extra level of log-in security, by enabling users to log in via Passkeys, which will provide another way to access your account without relying on passwords, or other less secure means..Passkeys, which enable fingerprint and face ID login, utilize cryptographic data transfer to facilitate access, with your actual login info remaining on your device. That makes it a more secure login option, and many cybersecurity experts are now recommending that social platforms support Passkey access..Which Facebook is now moving to align with..As explained by Meta:.“Passkeys will soon be available on iOS and Android mobile devices for Facebook, and we will begin rolling out passkeys to Messenger in the coming months. The same passkey you set up for Facebook will also work on Messenger once this capability launches.”.Meta says that users will also be able to use Passkeys to securely autofill payment information when making purchases using Meta Pay, while it’ll also be enabled to protect your encrypted message backups..It’s a good update, providing more security options for your Facebook info..Several other platforms have already enabled Passkey access, with X adding it early last year, along with TikTok and LinkedIn. And given the ongoing concerns around account hacking, it makes sense that, eventually, all platforms are likely to implement the option as another security measure..So really, Meta’s catching up on this front, but again, it will provide another potentially valuable option to help secure your Facebook info, including payment details, which could provide more assurance for users..Meta says that, once the option is available to you, you’ll be able to set up and manage your passkey in the “Accounts Center” via your profile settings..“Once it’s set up, you’ll be able to use your passkey moving forward to log in to Facebook on your mobile device. You’ll still be able to use other authentication methods, such as your password, to access your account.

The ChatGPT maker was already in the process of winding down its reliance on Scale before Meta, an OpenAI competitor, took a 49% stake in the firm, the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data needed to support increasingly advanced artificial intelligence models..OpenAI’s plans inject new uncertainty into Scale’s business in the wake of Meta’s unusual deal. Meta is investing $14.3 billion in Scale and has poached the startup’s chief executive officer, Alexandr Wang, for a new so-called “superintelligence” unit, focused on building a more powerful, and hypothetical, form of AI software. Other Scale employees are expected to follow Wang to Meta to work on AI..A Scale AI spokesperson declined to comment..Founded in 2016, Scale signed up prominent customers, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta and OpenAI, providing them with the data needed to build AI models. However, Meta’s deal with Scale raised concerns that the social-media company may gain new visibility into its rivals’ AI development efforts. Google plans to cut ties with Scale, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.Right after the Meta deal was announced, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar had signaled that the company intended to keep working with Scale. “We don’t want to ice the ecosystem because acquisitions are going to happen,” Friar said at the VivaTech conference in Paris last week.Over the past six to 12 months, however, OpenAI had determined that Scale was not the best fit for it because the AI developer needed more data expertise than Scale could provide, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI has shifted to building more advanced AI models that can mimic the process of human reasoning, as well as agent-like models that can carry out tasks with limited input from users. Forbes previously reported OpenAI had been winding down its Scale work for months.Scale initially focused on working with an army of contractors to do the grunt work of labeling text and images for earlier AI systems. Scale has gradually enlisted better-paid contractors with doctorates, nursing and other advanced degrees to help develop more sophisticated models.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-phasing-scale-ai-following-150114302.html,"```json

The funding will accelerate Tensec's mission to provide global trading companies and their clients access to cross-border real-time payments and transaction banking services that have historically been available only through large financial institutions..Led by Costanoa Ventures, the round also includes investments from Quiet Capital, WillowTree Investments, Cambrian VC, Ignia Partners, Montage Ventures, Renegade Partners, and Endeavor Scale Up Ventures..""SMBs drive nearly half of global trade but have long been excluded from the financial tools that larger players rely on,"" said Helcio Nobre, CEO and co-founder of Tensec. ""We're flipping the model by empowering global trading companies to deliver these services directly to their partners—making global commerce faster, cheaper and more accessible."".Tensec leverages AI, real-time payments and a global fintech infrastructure to create a no-integration platform that enables global trading companies to offer foreign exchange (FX) services, cross-border payments, treasury and other financial services to their SMB clients. The company is already working with customers who facilitate $10 billion in annual trade volume. Tensec projects this will grow to $30 billion in annual trade volume after its upcoming service expansion into APAC and the EU markets..""Tensec lets global trade companies seamlessly integrate financial services to better serve their clients,"" said Amy Cheetham, Partner at Costanoa Ventures. ""It's a win-win—new revenue for trading companies and modern financial tools for SMBs who've been underserved for decades."".Tensec is targeting the massive cross-border payments infrastructure that still runs on 40-year-old SWIFT technology. With global cross-border payments projected to reach $250 trillion by 2030, there has been significant fintech innovation in consumer and enterprise payments. However, SMB cross-border payments remain largely untouched by innovation, despite representing over 40% of the $25 trillion annual physical goods trade.

We are watching meta social media stocks and names in the crypto space. Yahoo Finance's Josh Shafer here to help me break them down a little bit more and do a deep dive on some of them. First up here, we got to set the stage and talk about OpenAI Sam Altman saying that meta is offering $100 million bonuses to open AI staff in attempt to build up meta's talent pool. The Facebook parent company getting more aggressive in attempts to improve its own artificial intelligence offerings. Meta reportedly delaying the rollout of its latest AI model because of concerns around quality. And CNBC also reporting that Zuckerberg is frustrated with meta's standing in big tech's AI race. This comes as meta announcing it will pay $14 billion for 49% stake in scale AI as well. .A hundred million dollar bonuses? I feel like we got to just press pause on that for a second. That's a pretty significant bonus. .That's crazy. .It makes you want to go on Udemy and start to take some quick coding classes or whatever you need necessary to qualify. .You and I are big sports fans and even someone like Patrick Mahomes, I don't think he's barely getting $100 million signing bonus, right? It's pretty shocking, but I think it gives you an idea obviously what you were just hinting at of where meta feels like they're at here and maybe needing to do a little bit more. Interesting to me because meta is one of the few companies on earnings calls that has been able to show how AI is helping their business, right? When you think about something like what they're doing with reels, how AI is playing a role in that, but this seems to be going for people from OpenAI. It seems to be more of that large language model play and doing something a little bit different and more targeted closer to what OpenAI is doing, not necessarily just using AI and sort of the AI use case space, but meta trying to be an industry leader in that large language model part of the AI story. .Yeah, seemed like he made this acknowledgement on the Uncapped podcast, which is hosted by his brother, we should note. Also here, it's interesting, this has been quite the week for OpenAI and getting some of their own major agreements here, of course, talking through some of the most recent developments here. They've got their first partnership with OpenAI and the government initiative, a pilot program with the US Department of Defense. It's a massive move forward for them and the chief digital and artificial intelligence office contract is worth about $200 million and the ceiling price for it. And essentially this is going to allow the Defense Department to identify and prototype frontier AI and how that can transform its own administrative operations. And so we'll see exactly what that looks like in practice, but this is a major step forward for OpenAI and acknowledgement of the power that they do have behind their engine. .I'm taking a look at our private market data that we have now on Yahoo Finance. OpenAI's estimated valuation per our data, $324 billion. .Yes. .If that company ever comes public, it might be the biggest IPO ever, Brad. .It could potentially be in the throws of it. Yes, for sure. I'm old enough to remember when Saudi Aramco went public though. That was a pretty large one too. Next up, we're checking out shares of social media stocks as President Trump set to delay Tik Tok's divest or ban deadline by another 90 days. The White House confirming that the president will sign an executive order this week extending the deadline, granting the administration more time to close a deal and keep Tik Tok working in the US. This would mark the president's third extension of the ban which requires Tik Tok's Chinese parent company sell off the US version of the app. There you're taking a look at some of the social media stocks on the move here pre-market. And of course it is one big pull for some of the advertising dollars that would go to Tik Tok versus a meta versus Snap versus Pinterest and how they all battle for those dollars. And ultimately, for Tik Tok, they've been able to quickly grow out their user base, make sure that they're also wooing some of those advertising dollars and how they're doing so is also making for a very competitive threat to these companies. .It's starting to feel like this ban just isn't going to happen, right? Because when things continuously get pushed back, continuously get pushed back, I just start to lose a little bit of confidence. .Such a pawn as part of the geopolitical discussions now. .Right, exactly, right? And that's why it keeps coming up. I think when we're talking about the social media stocks, I mean, the most interesting one to me is Snap, right? Just thinking about how Snap has performed as a stock over the last couple of years, I mean, it's down 25% year to date, down almost 50% over the last year. Snap needs some help, right? To bring in more users and drive future growth. Meta has still been successful with the rise of Tik Tok, right? I don't think people have an issue necessarily with where Instagram is at and what meta is doing with some of their social platforms. But Snap could use the boost. And so that's sort of the stock to watch for me as this continues and if we ever do actually get any form of a ban. .Yeah, Snap for their own, you know, defense here, the brand of ghost face chilla, they said that their community grew to 460 million daily active users, an increase of 38 million year over year in the most recent quarter and Q1 here. Q1 revenue increased 14% year over year, 1.36 billion. And it really comes back to some of direct response advertising, DR advertising as they talk about it on the call. We got to get to this last one here as well. Finally, the Senate passing the genius stable coin bill and sending it to the house in a big legislative step for the crypto industry. The bill largely requires stable coin issuers align with the same regulations that tradfi, traditional financial institutions must follow. A broader bill that currently sits in the house called the Clarity Act, seeking to regulate the crypto market as a whole here. There you're taking a look at Coinbase, Robin Hood and Circle on the move to the upside on this passage here for the genius bill. .Another headline that makes Circle stock go up, right? It feels like that stock has gone up almost every day since it's IPO a few weeks ago. .Yes. .But the stable coin conversation feels like it's really starting to heat up right now, doesn't it? I was talking to Julie Hyman about this last week and just we get in these moments where everyone needs to have a coin or everyone needs to have a stable coin or everyone needs to have their AI strategy. And when you think about the report last week of Walmart and Amazon starting to look into this, I just wonder how that conversation grows if as this act continues to work its way through the house. How does that conversation grow to? How many companies are going to try and deploy some version of a stable coin strategy? And is that report that we got last week about Walmart and Amazon, was that a they're looking into it or how seriously are they looking into it and are you and I going to need to get Amazon stable coin at some point to use Prime? .Look, all we've been discussing in our morning meetings and afternoon meeting yesterday was that this might say might make meta say, hey, hold my beer. DM's coming back. You can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page.

Zuckerberg’s remarks provided a candid look at how Meta Platforms (META) is leveraging AI to automate advertising and reshape enterprise workflows, with significant implications for investors and the company’s stock performance..Zuckerberg acknowledged the rapid pace of AI development, stating, “AI is going to transform pretty much every category of product and every part of the economy.” He addressed the ongoing debate over whether the current enthusiasm represents a bubble, noting that even if it takes five to ten years for AI to permeate every enterprise workflow, progress has consistently outpaced expectations..Grains, Unrest, & Gold: What Middle East Tensions Mean for Your Portfolio Now.Solar Stocks Are Plunging on Trump’s Tax Bill.

Sign up now!.“Being even more ambitious has been more predictive over the last few years about where things are likely going to be in the industry,” he said..Zuckerberg’s most striking comments focused on Meta’s vision for AI-driven advertising. He described a future where businesses no longer need to create their own ad creatives, identify target audiences, or measure campaign performance manually. Instead, “any business can come to us and say what their objective is, how much they're willing to pay to achieve those results, connect their bank account and then we just deliver as many results as we can. I think it'll be one of the most important and valuable AI systems that gets built,” he explained..Don’t Miss: .Move over Netflix & Disney: This Pre-IPO Startup Is Unlocking $2 Trillion in IP & Licensing Revenue.Global Content Battles Are Brewing — And This Pre-IPO Studio Just Raised $3.1M to Enter the Fight.Meta’s roadmap aims to enable fully automated AI advertising by 2026, allowing businesses to launch campaigns with minimal input — potentially just a business URL and a budget. AI will handle creative generation, targeting, and optimization, making advanced marketing accessible to companies of all sizes and reducing the need for specialized marketing expertise..Meta’s aggressive push into AI-powered automation is a key driver behind its strong stock performance in 2025. The company’s shares have surged 19% year-to-date, outperforming many of its tech peers. As of June 17, 2025, Meta’s stock currently sits just under $700, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s AI strategy and the broader digital advertising market.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/itll-one-most-important-valuable-134131299.html,"```json

Here's what investors need to know today..U.S. stock futures are little changed as investors continue to watch developments in the Israel-Iran conflict and prepare for today's Federal Reserve interest-rate decision. Stock and bonds markets will be closed tomorrow for the Juneteenth federal holiday. Nasdaq futures are flat after the tech-focused index fell 0.9% Tuesday amid a broader market downturn on geopolitical concerns. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures also are little changed. Oil futures are edging higher to trade around $75 a barrel. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and gold futures are lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is barely changed..The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it concludes its meeting at 2 p.m. ET today. Financial markets early Wednesday were pricing in nearly a 100% likelihood that the Federal Open Market Committee would leave the benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level it's been since December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. If the Fed leaves rates intact as expected, President Donald Trump could renew his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not moving to lower them. Powell is slated to address the media at 2:30 p.m. ET..Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy said in a company memo that he expects the online retailer to trim its corporate workforce over the next few years with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Jassy suggested AI agents could help accelerate innovation at Amazon by taking on rote work previously handled by human employees. Amazon had nearly 1.6 million full- and part-time employees as of March 31, according to its latest quarterly results.

191,2025-06-18 18:30:00,Meta Platforms Stock Will Soar Over the Next 5 Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.,"Meta plans to roll out AI-powered ads across its various platforms.  Over the last five years, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has been one of the best names to own.  Its shares have generated a total return of 192%, far exceeding the S&P 500' index's total return of 102% over the same period.","The shares have advanced by nearly 200% over the last five years..Meta plans to roll out AI-powered ads across its various platforms..This could provide a new source of revenue for the social media titan..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Over the last five years, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock has been one of the best names to own. Its shares have generated a total return of 192%, far exceeding the S&P 500' index's total return of 102% over the same period. Yet, I think Meta can match -- or even exceed -- its past performance thanks to the rise of AI-powered advertising..First, some background. Meta generates an incredible amount of revenue, nearly $175 billion annually, or roughly $500 million per day. Almost all -- around 97% -- comes from selling ad space across its platforms like Facebook and Instagram..Currently, most of those ads are designed and produced by advertising agencies. These companies work with brands to develop and track ad campaigns. Think Mad Men but updated for the 21st century. .That's where AI comes in. Meta has announced plans to begin rolling out AI-powered ads on its platform to allow brands to fully automate their advertising on Meta's systems by 2026..This is a big deal, because according to Statista, ad agencies in the U.S. alone generated nearly $64 billion in 2022. If Meta's AI-produced ads are a hit, the company could begin to take some share of this lucrative market away from traditional ad agencies..What's more, it's not a far-fetched idea. Many brands may be intrigued by what Meta's powerful AI could produce. In particular, Meta could use proprietary data to personalize ads, placing a custom-built ad into a user's feed..For example, Meta's AI could potentially use its powers of deduction to highlight the features most important to the prospective customer (safety, cost, reliability, etc.). In other words, these ads might be more effective than what ad agencies could ever hope to produce for a mass audience..In turn, Meta might land a new source of revenue, leading to further growth and a higher stock price. So, while there is still plenty of work to be done, AI-powered ads are one reason why investors should consider buying Meta stock right now..Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

It is crazy.”.“I am really happy that so far none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,” he added..It comes as Meta (META) plays catch-up in the race to develop next-generation artificial intelligence, a field pioneered by OpenAI. Mr Zuckerberg has taken a personal interest in the technology and has been spending billions to close the gap with rivals..Last week, Meta announced it would pay $14bn to take a 49pc stake in Scale AI, a fast-growing Silicon Valley AI company, and hire its 28-year-old founder Alexandr Wang to lead a new team dedicated to so-called “super-intelligence”..Mr Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally recruiting developers from rival businesses, including Google, by messaging them over WhatsApp..The billionaire is said to have rearranged the desk at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters so his AI leaders sit near to him..The billionaire has been racing to bring in new experts after its most recent AI product, known as Behemoth, was delayed..Speaking on a podcast to his brother, Jack, Mr Altman said he believed Meta’s “current AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped”. Mr Altman said that Mr Zuckerberg “thinks of [OpenAI] as their biggest competitor”..However, Mr Altman suggested that the huge signing bonuses could damage Meta’s company culture..He said: “I think the strategy of a tonne of upfront guaranteed [compensation] and that being the reason you tell someone to join, really the degree to which they are focusing on that and not the work and not the mission, I don’t think that is going to set up a great culture.”.OpenAI raised $40bn in funding in March as it seeks to develop powerful AI tools that Mr Altman has claimed could change society, work and scientific discovery..Its ChatGPT tool is used to write emails or automate tasks in the workplace, but Silicon Valley is betting hundreds of billions of dollars that a super-powerful “artificial general intelligence” could be on the horizon..Silicon Valley has been engulfed by a war for talent as tech giants seek to hire the brightest minds to develop new AI tools after the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT..Last year, Google paid $2.7bn to invest in Character AI, a chatbot business, in effect to re-hire its founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-offers-100m-signing-101630808.html,"```json

However, its revenue growth over the past few years has been modest, while much of its stock gains have come from multiple expansions, as its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been increasing..The company also appears to have fallen behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, with Apple Intelligence features reportedly consistently running into delays. In addition, some high-gross-margin revenue from a revenue-sharing agreement that allows Google to be the exclusive search engine for Safari on Apple devices is at risk after Alphabet lost an antitrust trial where the agreement was at the center of the case. While the company likely wouldn't lose all of this revenue, there is a risk that some of it would go away if it gave users the option to choose their default search engine..Against this background, the upside for Apple may be limited over the next several years, opening the door for other companies to become larger than Apple. Let's look at two companies that could exceed Apple's market cap in the next five years..With a market cap of roughly $2.3 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is well-positioned to overtake Apple in size over the next few years. The company is the market-share leader in two important segments: e-commerce and cloud computing. And while Apple has lagged on the AI front, Amazon has gone all in, incorporating AI throughout its businesses to help make them more efficient and drive growth..Its e-commerce business has settled into being a high single-digit, low double-digit percentage revenue grower. The segment is seeing strong margin expansion and operating leverage, which are powering profitability growth. Its high-gross margin, sponsored-ad business is playing a big part, with revenue climbing 19% year over year last quarter to $13.9 billion..Amazon is also seeing a lot of operational efficiencies. The company now incorporates AI throughout its warehouse and logistics operations to improve efficiencies and lower costs. It is developing AI-powered robots that can perform multiple tasks and even detect damaged items, helping the company save money on labor and costly returns. Meanwhile, it's using AI in its logistics business to help drivers save time and fuel by planning better routes and helping them more easily locate hard-to-find addresses in places like large apartment complexes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-thatll-worth-074500784.html,"```json

197,2025-06-18 13:00:00,Why the UK's AIM is struggling 30 years on,The UK's alternative investment market has seen some major successes since launching 30 years ago but has recently struggled to attract and retain companies.,"The UK's alternative investment market (AIM) has seen some major successes since its inception 30 years ago but has struggled to attract and retain companies in recent years..Launched on 19 June 1995, AIM was set up to help smaller and high-growth companies get more access to capital. When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L). ""As a result, we’re seeing many of the biggest and best AIM companies moving to a main market listing.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-uk-aim-struggling-alternative-investment-050024609.html,"```json
