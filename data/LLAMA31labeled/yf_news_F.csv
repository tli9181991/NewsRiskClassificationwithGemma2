Cox data shows that in March, the industry's supply stood at 92 days. In June, that figure fell to 70, with some automakers like Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC) having around half that amount..""The supply this year has been falling dramatically since March as the tariff-induced buying surge drew down available inventories,"" Chesbrough said..Read more: 6 steps to find cheap car insurance in 2025.Cox division Kelly Blue Book reports the average selling price of a new vehicle crept up to $48,799 in May, up from the month before but below the $50K mark seen in the height of the pandemic..As prices are poised to rise, sales may soon drop accordingly..May's sales pace fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.6 million, Chesbrough said, with June slumping even further to 15.3 million, with more declines to follow..""The impact of tariffs have not been felt, and that will change in the 2nd half of this year,"" Chesbrough said..Chesbrough said the Cox team predicts that if tariffs remain in place, sales will fall around 1% to 2% to 15.7 million for the year, down from 15.9 million last year..The pain from falling sales won't hit all automakers uniformly. While GM (GM) performed well in the first half of the year, Cox predicts Toyota (TM) and Ford (FORD) could outperform in the second half, based on strong results in the second quarter.

2,2025-06-26 20:30:00,Why Ford's EV Sales Could Hit a Speed Bump,"Ford has a healthy balance sheet but faces many headwinds right now.  For Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) investors, the company's recent EV sales growth is about to hit a speed bump thanks to its popular Mustang Mach-E. Here's what's going on.  Ford has had a rougher time with recalls than many of its competitors recently.","The Detroit carmaker issued a stop sale for all Mustang Mach-E vehicles..It recalled roughly 317,000 Mach-E vehicles for a door lock malfunction..Ford has a healthy balance sheet but faces many headwinds right now..10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›.When it comes to the global automotive industry, all signs point to an electrified future. Already, China's automotive market is testing 50% market share of electrified vehicles, but electric vehicle (EV) sales progress has been slower to gain traction in the U.S. market..For Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) investors, the company's recent EV sales growth is about to hit a speed bump thanks to its popular Mustang Mach-E. Here's what's going on..Ford has had a rougher time with recalls than many of its competitors recently. The Detroit icon is no stranger to leading in recall volume, and in the past it's dinged the company's bottom line and hindered profitability. Not all recalls are created equal, and issues that can be fixed with over-the-air updates can be considerably cheaper than having customers bring in their vehicles for a hardware fix..Unfortunately, the recent recall for Ford's Mustang Mach-E could be a little problematic. The automaker issued a global recall for roughly 317,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a malfunction that could cause drivers to be locked in or out of their vehicle, leaving a potentially dangerous scenario if a person were unable to exit the vehicle..On the bright side, Ford noted that so far no injuries or accidents have been linked to the defect, and that it's currently working on a software fix that will be available during the third quarter. Here's the kicker, though: Ford issued a stop sale for all Mustang Mach-E vehicles until the issue is fixed..For investors, that likely means a dip in EV sales in the near future. Year to date through May, Ford's Mustang Mach-E posted a modest 2.8% gain over the prior year -- far ahead of the gasoline-powered Mustang, which recorded an 18% drop in sales. Meanwhile, Ford's total electrified vehicle sales were up 18%, driven largely by a 31% uptick in hybrid vehicle sales..The problem is that the vast majority of EVs currently aren't profitable, and losing what little scale Ford has built due to the stop-sale pause on the Mustang Mach-E isn't going to help matters. Consider that Ford's Model-e business segment lost $4.7 billion in 2023 before losing almost $5.1 billion during 2024..This all comes at a time when Ford is already dealing with tariff headwinds and the strategies necessary to offset added costs. While Ford believes it can offset some of the tariff impacts, it still sees a net negative impact of roughly $1.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2025.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-fords-ev-sales-could-123000549.html,Operational Risk Industry Risk Regulatory Risk

Sustainable practices face cost and supply hurdles..Dublin, June 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Green Materials in Cars: A Strategic Analysis"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The automotive industry is undergoing a profound shift towards sustainability, driven by environmental regulations, consumer demand, and a growing awareness of the environmental impact of traditional materials..This report comprehensively analyzes green materials in the automotive sector, examining their definition, evolution, key categories, and applications. The report delves into the strategic implications of adopting green materials, analyzing their environmental impact reductions and comparing OEM approaches. The report also explores the regulatory landscape and future trends, providing a roadmap for sustainable material adoption in the future.Traditional automotive materials, such as steel, aluminum, and plastics derived from fossil fuels, pose significant environmental challenges:.High Carbon Footprint: These materials' extraction, processing, and manufacturing contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions..Resource Depletion: Reliance on finite resources like fossil fuels and metal ores raises concerns about resource depletion and supply chain vulnerability..Pollution and Waste: Manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal generate pollution and contribute to landfill waste..As an alternative to traditional materials, OEMs are increasingly experimenting with green and sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, recycled PET bottles, recycled metals, natural fibers, plant-based composites, bioplastics, and organic wastes from plants, trees, and consumers in different automotive applications within a car to offer lightweight and sustainable benefits. Recycled plastics and metals are the most adopted in the automotive industry. It provides a compelling combination of cost-effectiveness, reduced carbon emission benefits, and circular economy advantages compared with other green materials, making it the leading choice among OEMs.However, challenges persist with the full-scale implementation of these materials in vehicles. Implementing green and environmentally sustainable materials involves huge investments, which especially burdens small- and medium-scale automotive OEMs. Recovery and recycling processes are not compelling enough to obtain high-quality recycled products at a cost that can compete with primary raw material prices. Though bio-based materials are environmentally friendly, they are not entirely sustainable owing to inefficient sourcing methods (e.g., deforestation of trees), low biodegradability potential in some materials, and higher production costs.The base year of the report is 2024. It comprehensively analyzes each material and discusses different initiatives in the automotive ecosystem, highlighting the sustainability potential of materials, trend analysis, and strategic developments to provide a comprehensive understanding of the industry's trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/green-materials-cars-strategic-analysis-080700702.html,Regulatory Risk  Supply Chain Risk Environmental Risk  Operational Risk

15,2025-06-25 04:00:00,"Auto Tariffs Add $2,000 to New Car Prices","New tariffs are increasing car prices by nearly $2,000 per vehicle, impacting consumer sales and shifting the outlook for electric vehicle adoption in the US.","President Trump’s tariffs are hitting car buyers hard, with prices expected to rise nearly $2,000 per vehicle, according to consulting firm AlixPartners. The firm estimates that automakers will pass on 80% of the $30 billion tariff cost, adding about $1,760 per car, according to Bloomberg..“These tariffs bring a big wall of cost,” said Mark Wakefield, AlixPartners’ global auto lead. “We see consumers taking the majority of the hit.”.General Motors and Ford have already projected tariff-related hits of $5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and plan to offset some of it through price hikes. Wakefield warned this will result in around 1 million fewer cars sold in the U.S. over the next three years. Still, AlixPartners sees a rebound, projecting U.S. auto sales to hit 17 million by 2030..Bloomberg reports that while the 25% tariff is steep now, the firm expects it to ease as trade deals evolve, predicting a drop to 7.5% for assembled cars and 5% for parts. “This tariff wall is not likely to last forever,” Wakefield noted..What may have longer-lasting consequences, however, is the Trump administration’s rollback of EV incentives, including the $7,500 consumer tax credit. Without that support, Americans are expected to “follow their pocketbook,” Wakefield said, and stick with gas-powered cars..As a result, AlixPartners slashed its EV forecast for 2030. They now see battery electrics making up just 17% of U.S. car sales—down from an earlier prediction of 31%. Internal combustion engines, previously expected to fall to one-third of sales, are now projected to hold at 50%. Traditional hybrids are forecast to reach 27%, while plug-in hybrids will make up only 6%..Wakefield warned that these policy shifts could seriously undercut U.S. automakers in the global EV race, potentially making them reliant on Chinese platforms and technology..“It makes it much more likely that they end up licensing or joint venturing or otherwise using platforms and EV technologies from China,” he said..And while American automakers might still dominate one segment, Wakefield had a biting prediction: “They’ll have the world’s best V8 engines by 2028. They’ll probably also have the world’s only V8 engines by 2028.”.By Zerohedge.com.More Top Reads From Oilprice.com.Alberta Exceeded Its Flaring Limit for Years Before Scrapping It.Europe Struggles To Find Diplomatic Role in Israel-Iran Conflict.Russia Considers AI Data Centers as Collapsing Gas Sales Create Glut.Read this article on OilPrice.com",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-tariffs-add-2-000-200000473.html,- Market Risk - Economic Risk - Consumer Risk
16,2025-06-25 00:32:00,Feds question Ford in hands-free driving investigation,The top federal vehicle safety regulator has sent Ford an exhaustive list of questions about its hands-free driver-assistance system known as BlueCruise. It's the latest development in an investigation that started more than one year ago following two fatal crashes involving the software.,"The top federal vehicle safety regulator has sent Ford an exhaustive list of questions about its hands-free driver-assistance system known as BlueCruise. It’s the latest development in an investigation that started more than one year ago following two fatal crashes involving the software..The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) sent a letter to Ford on June 18 that contains 25 questions. Many of them are basic, such as asking Ford for a detailed list of vehicles that have been equipped with BlueCruise. But the NHTSA also wants internal Ford documents related to the crashes that sparked the probe, the development of BlueCruise, descriptions of any changes made to the software, and much more..It’s the first “information request” that the NHTSA has sent Ford since it upgraded the investigation in January to a level known as an “engineering analysis.” That progression is a required step before NHTSA can ask Ford to issue a recall..A Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the company is working with the NHTSA to support this investigation..The ODI opened the investigation in April 2024 after two fatal crashes. In each of those incidents, the drivers were using BlueCruise when they crashed into vehicles that were stationary. They were the first known fatalities resulting from crashes involving the use of BlueCruise..Ford only allows drivers to use BlueCruise on pre-mapped highways. The hands-free system uses cameras, radar sensors, and software to handle steering, speed, and braking on certain highways. The software is paired with an in-cabin camera with an eye-tracking system that is supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention to the road ahead. The system, which costs $495 a year or $2,495 as a one-time purchase, is available in the Ford Explorer, Ford Expedition, Ford F-150 truck, and the all-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E..The crashes in early 2024 raised the question of how capable Ford’s system is at recognizing stationary objects — a problem that has plagued Tesla’s own driver-assistance software for years..The NHTSA said in January, when it upgraded the investigation, that it has discovered “limitations in the detection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions” and that BlueCruise’s performance “may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination.” (Both fatal crashes occurred at night.).In the new letter, the NHTSA has asked Ford for more information about the BlueCruise software’s “logic and/or algorithms used in the detection and classification of hazards in front of” the vehicle..Ford has until August 6 to submit its responses to the 25 questions or face civil penalties.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-ford-hands-free-driving-163237631.html,- Regulatory Risk - Product Liability Risk - Financial Risk - Reputation Risk

It’s brought together industry lobbies from the Crypto Council for Innovation to the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Even Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are finding common cause, along with predictable parts of the tech sector including chipmakers and wireless providers..The reason is that chips are now in almost everything: refrigerators and microwaves, tire pressure sensors and navigation systems, electronic bidets and sonar equipment and, of course, smartphones and computers. Tariffs threaten to snarl supply lines and jack up costs for consumers..“There’s a large mismatch between the amount of chips we use in this country in various products and the supply created here in the US,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview. “Putting a tax on those imports will simply raise the cost, and that’s not a good thing for consumers.”.Case in point is the marine association, which warns the impact would be felt by more than 1,300 manufacturers who face higher expenses for essentials like propulsion technology, engines and GPS systems..“These systems are not optional luxuries — they are fundamental to safety, function and performance,” the association said. “Many components have no US equivalent or are only available from highly concentrated suppliers overseas.”.The boating sector’s concerns were among comments from 154 stakeholders submitted to a Commerce Department review of whether to slap tariffs on chips as part of Trump’s campaign to redraw global supply lines and boost domestic manufacturing. Predictable tech sources weighed in, including chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp. But feedback also landed from a wide spectrum of sectors, along with trading partners like Japan and Brazil..The companies, trade groups and individuals who commented on the chips investigation largely signaled support for the president’s vision of deepening the US manufacturing base and expanding the American workforce. Yet most expressed concern over the potential consequences and urged making any levies that emerge as targeted as possible.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-chip-tariff-threat-sparks-140000127.html,- Economic Risk - Trade Risk - Supply Chain Risk

However, at a little over 16 times estimated profits, its valuation is a fraction of Tesla’s at 150 times, a multiple based heavily on expectations for a service that investors had been waiting years for..“People are underestimating Waymo in a pretty significant way, while overestimating Tesla,” said Samuel Rines, macro strategist at WisdomTree. Alphabet’s valuation “assigns basically zero value to Waymo even though it has the best tech, it is already operating, and it has deals with OEMs,” referring to original equipment manufacturers..Alphabet rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla shares were little changed..Investor excitement about self-driving technology is rooted in the vast size of the potential market. Annual ride-hailing sales could exceed $325 billion by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. As much as $20 billion of that could come from robotaxis, analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a research note on Monday..Waymo currently offers self-driving paid rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and San Francisco and just began offering trips through Uber Technologies Inc.’s platform in Atlanta, with Miami and Washington expected next year. Last week, Waymo applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City, sending Uber and Lyft Inc. shares lower..Waymo was valued at more than $45 billion in October, putting it roughly on par with the market capitalizations of both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. It’s a drop in the bucket for Alphabet, however, with a market value of more than $2 trillion..Still, Waymo is an increasingly attractive part of Alphabet’s portfolio and should offer “long-term upside” for shareholders, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-lacks-tesla-stock-buzz-101252621.html,Market Risk

The company plans to replicate the successful footprint it has established in the European market, where it powers computer vision-aided robots at major manufacturers, including Stellantis, Renault, Volkswagen, Ford, and Beko..Powered by 3D vision and AI, Inbolt’s solution enables industrial robots, such as those from ABB, FANUC, and Universal Robots, to perceive production lines and adapt to real-world changes in industrial environments, just as humans would..Currently deployed in over 50 factories worldwide, Inbolt has powered more than 20 million robot cycles in the first half of 2025 alone. Delivering performance up to 100 times faster than competitors, the company has enabled customers to achieve remarkable returns on automation, including reducing downtime by up to 97% and cutting part rejection rates by 80%..“Manufacturers today don’t have the luxury of time. They need to launch new products quickly, respond to shifts in consumer demand overnight, and continue production without costly retooling. That level of agility starts with intelligent automation,” said Albane Dersey, co-founder and COO of Inbolt. “As we expand into the US and Japan, we’re partnering with manufacturers that see the strategic advantage in 3D vision and AI powering systems that evolve with demand, switch models in hours, and keep production moving.”.The entrance into the US and Japanese markets reflects the Paris-based startup’s strategy to accelerate its global expansion and tap into the growing demand for automation, ranked as the top strategic priority for 46% of global manufacturers over the next two years, according to Deloitte. Backed by its $17 million Series A funding round in 2024, Inbolt is launching local teams in the US and Japan and kicking off a hiring drive for robotics application engineers to support its next phase of growth..The move to the US reflects America's growing commitment to reshoring, as it leads global efforts to bring manufacturing back to domestic soil and power automation.

They include: Heightened global uncertainty due to fears of a wider war in the Middle East and higher US tariffs; South Africa’s potential exclusion from a trade deal that gives African nations preferential access to the world’s biggest economy; a shift to electric vehicles in key export markets; and a flood of cheap imports..South Africa is the world’s most unequal country and its economy has barely grown over the past decade. Still, the automotive sector remains a key driver of output, accounting for about 5% of gross domestic production. Averting a fourth-consecutive deadlock in pay talks and a potential strike by more than 100,000 workers is seen as key for the survival of an industry that has long been hobbled by electricity-supply constraints and logistics challenges..“The economy isn’t performing well and a flat 10% increase along with some of the other challenges will negatively impact the performance of businesses,” said Siyabonga Mthembu, a partner at BDO South Africa. “International companies operating in South Africa’s automotive sector are particularly at risk and will have to consider survival strategies such as market diversification. Sometimes, looking at pay in isolation of other factors at play can be very dangerous and I think all the parties need to sit around a table and understand the entire ecosystem.”.Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, Numsa’s spokesperson, has said that asking for an inflation-linked increase is “unrealistic” because its members are struggling to survive.

It will manufacture lower-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries for future EVs.,"MARSHALL, Mich. — Despite political headwinds, pushback from some local residents and now costly tariffs on equipment that has yet to reach U.S. shores, Ford Motor Co. executives say they still think building a $3 billion battery plant here was the right move for the automaker..Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of technology platform programs and electric vehicle systems, told reporters here that the company has taken a substantial hit from import tariffs on equipment that will be coming to the U.S. from China..The 2 million-square-foot plant is slated to open in 2026 and produce lithium iron phosphate batteries for future EVs using some intellectual property from China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL)..But Drake said the added costs are bearable in the long run..“Even with the tariffs, this is still the right thing to do versus the choice of importing this technology into the U.S.,” Drake said. “I’d still rather have the equipment here.

Ford already scaled down the project from a larger planned investment in response to slowing EV adoption..Executive Chair Bill Ford said in May that the site was in peril if production tax credits from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act were eliminated in a federal budget bill making its way through congress..Drake said the tax credits essentially became a lifeline to the site after EV adoption rates slowed and that the automaker believes it’s unfair to take away something that was promised when the project began..“Because our timeline for investment is so long, when these rules change so fast, they’re very material for us,” Drake said. “We don’t want to back off on this facility. If anything we want to go faster.”.Sign up for the quarterly Automotive News U.S. Sales report to get data and news sent to your inbox as soon as it’s compiled..Roughly 1,800 workers are currently building the site, and Ford Motor eventually expects to employ 1,700 people there building batteries. CATL will train the workers initially, but the equipment and work force will belong to Ford..Drake said the size of the workforce could change depending on the tax credits..“It would be a shame to build these facilities and all of a sudden you have to scale back on the most important part of it, which is people,” Drake said. “There are 1,700 jobs that don’t come around that often.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-says-michigan-battery-plant-180000172.html,1.

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman chat with Washington Crossing Advisors senior portfolio manager Chad Morganlander and Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz about the event and what it means for Tesla investors..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here..All right, now let's turn to my stock of the day. That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

29,2025-06-23 21:07:00,Ford Stock Looks Cheap at 0.26X P/S - But is It Worth Buying?,"F appears attractively valued and yields over 5%, but mounting EV and tariff headwinds raise caution.","U.S. legacy automaker Ford F is currently trading at a 0.26 forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, below the industry levels as well as its own 5-year average. The valuation also stacks up favorably against its closest peer, General Motors GM, and the electric vehicle giant, Tesla TSLA. General Motors has a P/S of 0.27X, while Tesla is trading at a much loftier 9.88X multiple. Of course, Tesla’s valuation is less tied to current fundamentals and more driven by optimism around unproven future bets, like robotaxis and artificial intelligence..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Ford looks undervalued despite the stock rising roughly 7% year to date against the industry’s loss of more than 19%. Over the same timeframe, shares of General Motors have declined almost 10%, and Tesla slid 20%..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.With Ford’s valuation looking cheap, the real question now is whether Ford has the momentum and fundamentals to deliver a real upside from here..Ford remains a key player in the U.S. auto market, with a lineup that continues to resonate with American buyers. The F-Series trucks continue to be a best-seller, and models like the Maverick pickup, Escape, Explorer, Expedition, and Edge keep Ford well-positioned in the SUV and crossover space..One of the major key catalysts for Ford currently is its Ford Pro business, which is focused on commercial customers. The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future for the Ford Pro segment. The growing interest in its software and service offerings is also driving the unit’s earnings. The segment has around 675,000 paid software subscriptions, with strong ARPU growth driving incremental revenues. Software services also serve as a countercyclical measure for the segment..Ford’s healthy balance sheet and investor-friendly moves instill investor confidence. The company ended the first quarter of 2025 with roughly $45 billion in liquidity, including around $27 billion in cash. Its superior liquidity profile provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities. Encouragingly, Ford is on track to deliver $1 billion in net cost reductions this year, excluding tariff effects..Ford’s dividend yield of over 5% stands out as an attractive option for income-focused investors, especially when stacked against the S&P 500’s average yield of just more than 1%. With plans to return 40-50% of its free cash flow to shareholders, Ford underscores its commitment to rewarding investors, even as it navigates a major transformation of its business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-looks-cheap-0-130700382.html,1.

The factory was to make cylindrical battery cells for BMW’s next-generation Neue Klasse EVs..Despite the delay, BMW said it remains on track to begin EV production at its Greer, S.C., assembly plant late next year..AESC, majority-owned by China’s Envision Group, attributed the halt in construction to “policy and market uncertainty.”.Japan-based AESC, which has invested more than $1 billion in the Florence plant, said it anticipates resuming construction once “circumstances stabilize.”.This year, AESC canceled a $1.5 billion expansion at the site. The supplier has struggled to secure financing for the battery project, and U.S. tariffs have escalated startup costs because AESC planned to import some factory equipment from China, according to people with knowledge of the matter..The federal budget bill making its way through Congress could imperil Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Mich., Bill Ford, the company’s executive chair, said in May. That’s because the company is relying on a Biden administration battery production tax credit that would be eliminated if the bill becomes law..However, construction at the site continues and is now more than halfway complete, a spokesperson said. Equipment is set to be installed in the plant in the coming months, as Ford remains on track to begin production there in 2026. Ford originally planned to create 2,500 jobs, but the company in 2023 downsized its plans to roughly 1,700, with planned annual capacity of the lithium iron phosphate batteries falling by more than 40 percent to 20 gigawatt-hours.

Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same. So, which company is better placed to thrive in the future?.Tesla's launch of its full-self-driving (FSD) robotaxi is sometimes seen as a tactical move as its electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share come under pressure in 2025, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that major automakers, including Ford, and leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving, and it's an integral part of the future of the auto industry..The reason behind the investment is a recognition that robotaxis have huge profit potential, not least because they offer a long stream of recurring income from ride-per-mile revenue..Another reality is that EVs are not cheap, and if they are the future of the auto industry, automakers need to make them more affordable. They also need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable..However, don't take my word for it. Here's Ford's CEO Jim Farley in 2019 on autonomous driving and robotaxis: ""The self-driving system is incredibly important to develop, but it's just one part of building a safe and scalable self-driving service that consumers can trust."" Farley went on to outline a timeline for a ""commercial self-driving service"" in 2021, which Ford would fail to achieve..As for affordable EVs, last year, Farley reiterated the need to offer smaller and more affordable EVs to achieve profitability as an EV maker..The two things are strongly connected. You can't have robotaxi EVs if the vehicles aren't affordable. That's a point that resonated during a recent CNBC interview with Waymo, which has a robotaxi service already in place, yet co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana declined to outline a timeline for the company's profitability. Waymo's lack of profitability means its owner, Alphabet, is going to have to invest significant sums, at a loss, if it wants Waymo to build scale. That creates a huge opportunity for a company like Tesla that is just entering the market and potentially offers a much more commercial and scalable service.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-200500011.html,1.

China’s system is improving but remains cumbersome, they said, contrary to Trump’s assurances rare earths would flow “up front” after a June 11 accord struck in London..The delays are holding an array of American industries hostage to the rocky US-China relationship, as some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China. That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing in Geneva last month, and triggering fresh rounds of retaliation..Interviews with multiple Western buyers, industry insiders and officials familiar with discussions revealed frustration over vague policies in both countries and lingering confusion about what level of magnet approvals from China would trigger Trump to abandon his tit-for-tat export curbs..“Even if export approvals accelerate, there are so many unknowns about the licensing regime that it’s impossible for companies to have a strong sense of certainty about future supply,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “At a minimum, they need to factor in a real possibility that talks could break down again, and exports will be halted.”.In response to China’s sluggishness on magnets, Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China until President Xi Jinping restores rare-earth exports. Companies subject to Washington’s curbs have halted billions of dollars in planned shipments as they wait for players in unrelated sectors to secure permits from Beijing, which could take weeks or even months to process, given the current pace..Corporate chiefs affected by the export-control spat have sought clarity from the administration on its strategy, according to people familiar with the matter.

The industry-wide supply chain is yet to wholly grasp the impact of tariffs on production, changes in the implementation of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs. In this context, Ford announced its prediction of a net adverse adjusted EBIT impact of about $1.5 billion for 2025. It logged $1 billion adjusted EBIT in the first quarter of 2025, but due to prevailing instability in the industry, guidance has been withdrawn..Although there remains uncertainty, Ford, being one of the largest auto manufacturers in the United States, might expect certain advantages. Ford, compared with its competitors, built 300,000 more vehicles in the United States last year. This provides the company with a competitive edge. Its peers will face difficulties in increasing manufacturing capacity in the country, as that would entail huge costs, compromising affordability. Ford’s 80% parts in use are already USMCA trade rules compliant. The company seeks other ways to build more parts locally..It has also implemented smart changes to tackle impacts. Ford now ships vehicles from Mexico to Canada using bonded carriers, which avoids U.S. tariffs. A similar strategy is also followed for auto parts that only travel through the United States. Ford seems confident as it has been building more in America since 2020, investing $50 billion to grow vehicle and battery production..General Motors Company (GM), an auto giant of America, has predicted declines in profit this financial year. It imported the highest number of cars into the United States in the last year. General Motors lowered guidance owing to an estimated $4 million to $5 million exposure to the impacts of auto tariffs. However, a mitigation of 30% of cost increases due to tariffs can be expected through General Motors’ tailored initiatives..Stellantis N.V.

The White House has previously said it won’t join Israel’s attacks, the report says..TIKTOK BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump intends to sign an executive order sparing TikTok from a law banning or forcing a sale of the social media platform, again delaying a deadline for enforcement of said law, the Wall Street Journal’s Alex Leary reports. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Publicly traded companies in the space include Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Reddit (RDDT) and Snap (SNAP)..STABLECOIN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to set up the first regulatory framework for stablecoins, Axios’ Stephen Neukam reports. The GENIUS Act, which has been criticized by many Democrats over corruption concerns surrounding President Trump’s growing cryptocurrency empire, was passed with a 68-30 vote, with two GOP members voting no on the legislation, the author says. Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital (BTBT), Bitfarms (BITF), Coinbase (COIN), Core Scientific (CORZ), Greenidge Generation (GREE), Mara Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Strategy (MSTR), Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) and TeraWulf (WULF)..PSYCHEDELIC FIELD: Companies, advocates and investors in the psychedelic field are hopeful the Trump administration will support the space after favorable sentiments by several key officials, STAT News’ Olivia Goldhill and Meghana Keshavan report, citing sources. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, has voiced support for psychedelics as a potential mental health treatment and Calley Means, a White House adviser, wrote that psychedelics “should be an important public policy priority for the United States”. Additionally, Casey Means, the president’s surgeon general pick, described psilocybin therapy as “one of the most meaningful experiences of life” and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has made positive remarks on the opportunity the substances could hold for veterans. Publicly traded companies in the space include Atai Life Sciences (ATAI), Clearmind (CMND), Compass Pathways (CMPS), Cybin (CYBN), GH research (GHRS) and Mind Medicine (MNMD).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-trade-president-said-weigh-141055103.html,1.

37,2025-06-19 22:09:00,Ford Pauses Mustang Mach-E Sales Due to Door Lock Issue,F halts Mustang Mach-E sales globally after door defect raises safety concerns; software fix expected in Q3 2025.,"Ford Motor Company F is issuing a global recall for around 317,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a malfunction that could cause drivers to become locked out or, in some cases, leave the occupant trapped inside the car.The recall affects Mach-E models from the 2021 to 2025 model years, both in the United States and abroad. Ford has instructed its dealers not to sell or deliver any affected vehicles, which are manufactured in Mexico, until a forthcoming software update addresses the problem.The issue arises when the car is shut off and the occupants exit using the mechanical interior door handles. The doors might stay locked after closing, posing a danger if a child or pet remains inside. Ford warned that in such situations, a person who exits may be unable to quickly re-enter and assist someone still inside who cannot open the door from within, potentially leading to serious harm, especially in high temperatures.So far, Ford says no injuries or accidents have been linked to the defect. The automaker is working on a software fix, expected to become available in the third quarter. Until then, the stop-sale order remains active. While current owners will be eligible for the update, some may need to visit a dealership rather than receiving it over the air. Once the fix is ready, Ford will contact owners via mail to arrange a service appointment at no cost.From January through May this year, Ford sold 19,258 Mach-E units in the United States, up 2.8% from the same period last year. In contrast, sales of the gas-powered Mustang fell 18% to 19,309 units.The company recently increased the Mach-E's price by up to $2,000, partly in response to a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts imposed by President Donald Trump. Ford estimates these tariffs will cost the company $2.5 billion in 2025, though it aims to offset $1 billion of that through pricing and cost-cutting strategies..Ford carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.Some better-ranked stocks in the auto space are CarGurus, Inc.

As ever, innovative vehicles is how it could get there. One such will be a ladder-frame chassis small SUV. Back in 2021 we saw the Compact Cruiser EV concept and now patent application pictures have revealed how a larger, evolved model will look. Small windows, a pronounced dark plastic perimeter of bumpers linked to side cladding, deep ridges in the roof and a spare tyre on the side-mounted tailgate all feature..Pairing up with the Indian market’s long-time dominant force was a smart move. One example of why will be launched in European countries during the fourth quarter. Revealed at the Brussels motor show in January, the Urban Cruiser is an electric 4.3 m long SUV for Europe supplied from Suzuki’s Hansalpur plant in Gujarat. Supplementing the Yaris Cross Hybrid, this FWD/AWD model will offer 49 kWh and 61 kWh (gross) battery options in combination with 106 kW, 128 kW and 135 kW motors..The next ‘FJ Cruiser’ (name TBC), on the other hand, will have as its basis the existing IMV platform. This has been around for some time and presently underpins all manner of vehicles including not only the Hilux but its Hilux Champ derivative. The future SUV should be manufactured in Thailand and/or Indonesia with India another possibility. Look to 2026 for its debut..XA60: Toyota’s next global number one model.Images and some details of what will be Toyota Motor Corporation’s next best seller were revealed on 21 May. XA60, the next Robust Accurate Vehicle with 4 Wheel Drive, is a rebodying of the existing GA-K platform XA50. It even has the same 2,690 wheelbase. As keeps happening with many big-volume Toyotas, non-electrified powertrains are to be dropped as part of the redesign..The new RAV4 2.5-litre HEV gets a 22.7 kWh battery and with it, the claim that range in EV mode extends to as many as one hundred kilometres. For the PHEV, add a further fifty. Existing owners will also love the expansion in boot space, claimed to be 749 litres, up from 733. There are also different front-end treatments, something which many Japanese OEMs have long given their models in the home market..Toyota Motor Sales USA says deliveries of what will be its 2026 RAV4 will start towards the end of this year. Just a few months later, an electric-only alternative will be launched, this being the C-HR. All-wheel drive will feature, along with a combined 338 hp from motors front and back, plus the same 74.7 kWh battery soon to be fitted to the 2026 bZ.

The $2.5 billion factory is being geared up to launch production next year of lower-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, a pillar of the automaker’s strategy to expand market share with more affordable EVs..But the plant is a lightning rod for controversy because Ford is licensing technology from Chinese battery behemoth CATL.

47,2025-06-18 02:53:00,Could GM rival Tesla in EV sales by 2026? These electric vehicles are the ones to watch,General Motors electric vehicle sales have skyrocketed in the first few months of 2025. Here's what you need to know about the company's EVs.,"General Motors is one of the Big Three American automakers alongside Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) and Ford. Like Ford, GM has made incredible headway in the EV space, rolling out competitive electric vehicles across its portfolio of brands. Some of its nameplates are giving the company the potential to overthrow Tesla as the dominant EV sales leader..Affordability, brand recognition, and Tesla's recent fall from grace are all contributing factors in GM's sudden EV sales boom. Does the automaker have what it takes to dethrone a brand that has become synonymous with electric vehicles in America?.GMC electric vehicle sales increased by a whopping 183% from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025, according to Cox Automotive, an automotive research company. The American automaker sold 4,728 EVs, up from 1,668 EVs in the first quarter of 2024. Its Chevrolet brand sold 19,186 electric vehicles, a 114% increase from 8,957 in the first quarter of 2024..Cadillac, GM's luxury division, saw electric vehicle sales increase by over 37% from 5,800 to 7,972 year-over-year. On paper, General Motors is gaining serious traction in its mission to become a competitor in the EV space. A closer look at some of its most popular offerings across its portfolio of brands shows just how easy it could be for the company to overtake Tesla in the future..◾Chevrolet Equinox EV (10,329 units).◾Chevrolet Blazer EV (6,187 units).◾Cadillac Lyriq (4,300 units).◾GMC Hummer Truck/SUV (3,479 units).General Motors offers 10 electric vehicles across its GMC, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands. Of the 10 EVs, the Chevrolet Equinox EV is its bestselling model by thousands of units. Chevrolet has sold 10,329 Equinox EV models in Q1 2025. Its pricing and specs explain why the electric family SUV is becoming so popular among drivers..The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV LT 1 front-wheel drive starts at $34,995. According to Chevy, it's eligible for the federal electric vehicle tax credit of $7,500, bringing its true cost closer to $27,495. The Equinox EV is the most affordable electric SUV in its segment (factoring in the tax incentive)..Chevy's EV has an estimated 319 miles of driving range.

With that in mind, this article will...","One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), by way of a worked example..Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..ROE can be calculated by using the formula:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ford Motor is:.11% = US$5.0b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025)..The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.. See our latest analysis for Ford Motor .One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Ford Motor has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Auto industry average (11%)..So while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Ford Motor by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here..Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same..It seems that Ford Motor uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 3.46. We consider it to be a negative sign when a company has a rather low ROE despite a rather high debt to equity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/good-ford-motor-company-nyse-120037348.html,Market Risk

They eventually separate, and in the Trump-Musk scenario, rather dramatically..Sign up for Automotive News Canada’s weekly podcast newsletter for a lively and in-depth discussion of the biggest stories..While Musk was busy angering his liberal customer base by aligning with Trump in the most visible manner possible as the chainsaw-wielding head of the Department of Government Efficiency, the leaders of other auto companies were largely out of the news and focused on battling Trump’s tariffs..What they were not doing was making their brands unpopular..Tesla gained a cult-like following partly because Musk was seen as a rebel, but, as we’ve witnessed, the potential volatility cuts both ways..Interest in Tesla among Canadians with intentions of buying an electric vehicle has fallen to 13 per cent from 29 a year ago, according to the J.D. Power 2025 Canada Electric Vehicle Consideration Study, released May 29. The survey, detailed in a separate story, doesn’t get into the reasons Canadians are turning their backs on Tesla, but Musk’s politics — and saying Canada isn’t a real country — are likely the key driver. In one fell swoop, Musk became a pariah, and Tesla is paying the price..Aside from public protests, several provinces removed Tesla from their EV rebate programs, and Ottawa froze Incentives for Zero Emission Vehicle (iZEV) payments as it investigated the validity of a large number of last-minute Tesla rebate claims..Before the Musk-Trump bromance, people would buy Teslas, seemingly no matter how good or bad the vehicle was, because of Musk. Now, no matter how good or bad the vehicle is, they’re less likely to buy because of Musk..It’s all so unnecessary..The lesson, which most people in business know, is don’t mix in politics. Regardless of whether that’s seen as commonplace or even expected in the Trump orbit, the obvious problem is that sharply divisive politics can make permanent enemies out of customers..Musk, in aligning with Trump, had everything to lose and little to gain. Trump for years has openly berated EVs, so it’s not like his supporters would be suddenly swayed by the tacky and now-infamous Tesla sales pitch on the White House lawn.

Through all the noise, however, Ford Motor Company's (NYSE: F) aggressive employee pricing for all customers has been a huge success and could be setting the company up for a stronger quarter..A couple of months ago, Ford announced that it would offer employee discounts to all customers through June 2, which was later extended through July 6, covering nearly all Ford and Lincoln models. The employee discount will be applied in addition to any other incentives. It's an aggressive move that can save several thousands of dollars on most vehicles at a time when many people are concerned about rising new vehicle prices..The good news is that the pricing strategy has driven substantial demand for Ford and increased its market share over the past two months, compared to the prior year. More specifically, Ford posted a 14.7% share of the U.S. market at the end of May, up 1.9 percentage points compared to the prior year. It's a big gain for Ford, which typically competes with its rivals for tenths of market share..There's plenty of uncertainty in the U.S. market, and Ford believes its employee pricing program is a way to provide consumers with a little more stability while executives try to better understand the effect of tariffs..""There's no question that obviously prices are going to rise as more things come out,"" said Rob Kaffl, Ford's director of U.S. sales, when speaking to Automotive News.

I'm talking about the F-Series pickup trucks. To achieve a feat like this in any industry is amazing. And it makes this business a staple of the American economy and a visible brand for consumers..Ford has had a great year thus far. As of June 11, shares are up 9% in 2025, tripling the gain of the S&P 500 index. Maybe this automotive stock can continue the momentum as we look ahead..Should investors buy Ford shares while they currently trade below $11? Here are the most important variables to consider..Investors don't typically view Ford as a fast-growing enterprise. However, the company's growth this year has been impressive. Unit sales soared 16.3% in May. This follows double-digit year-over-year gains in March and April as well..After President Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported vehicles in April, Ford's leadership team made a strategic move to boost demand. The business implemented an employee pricing program for customers. This will be in effect until the Fourth of July weekend..Ford registered strong gains with its internal combustion and hybrid cars, but electric vehicles (EVs) remained a notable weak point. Unit sales for EVs were down 25% in May, underscoring the troubles facing this niche of the auto market. Consumer demand for what many thought was the future of the industry is slowing..Investors who intend to own a stock for the next five or 10 years need to figure out if they're looking at a high-quality business. I believe there is a best way to test this, at least from a purely quantitative perspective..During the first quarter, Ford reported a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 8.6%. This is too low for me; I'd only look at companies that have a figure of more than 20% here, as it indicates the ability to allocate capital in a lucrative manner. Ford's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), on the other hand, is estimated at 11.1%, so the business could very well be destroying value with its decisions..Ideally, investors want to buy and hold businesses that report ROIC that's well ahead of their WACC. I don't think Ford will ever fall into this category. The nature of the auto industry requires companies to invest huge sums in product development, manufacturing capacity, labor, and marketing. And this is just table stakes. That's why Ford's profitability is low.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-ford-while-below-11-124500982.html,1. Market risk 2. Credit risk 3. Liquidity risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed..Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is another car company that has featured regularly on Cramer's morning show. He has commented on the firm because of its financial problems and exposure to tariffs. Cramer has shared on multiple occasions that Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s warranty expenses have dragged the firm's stock down. He has also indicated that the firm is not as exposed to tariff-induced disruption as its peer and rival, General Motors. The CNBC host's recent comments about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) surrounded the firm suffering from having invested in electric vehicle infrastructure while the Trump administration seeks to rollback some incentives:.""I'm just very concerned about Ford. . . I just think that they, like many companies, built a lot of infrastructure, that was around, electric vehicles. They are under pressure."".However, while Cramer has criticized Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s warranty costs, he believes the firm is in a better position to navigate through tariff-induced disruption. In a recent morning show, after CNBC's Phil Lebow interviewed GM's CEO, Cramer remarked:.“You know, listen, Phil, you had an amazing interview with Mary Barra, I’ve got to ask you, it looks like that Ford has an edge on GM. When it comes to what’s going on. In terms of tariffs. Because I think that Jim Farley for whatever reason makes much more in pure America than GM does."".Overall, F ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of F as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On its latest earnings release, Ford Pro clocked $1.3 billion EBIT. Ford Blue reported $96 million EBIT, a slump from the prior-year quarter’s $901 million, losing significant momentum. The Model e segment could not break its streak of continuous losses. Thus, Ford Pro has proven to be the only competitive advantage in Ford’s stride..The Ford Pro segment offers products and services to its commercial customers, including small businesses, fleet operators and government agencies. The lineup of customer favourites, such as F-150, Transit Van, Super Duty, Maverick, makes it a strong product-driven segment. Ford also provides additional services like fleet management and financing options to its customers..Ford Pro currently holds 40% market share in North America and aims to maintain EBIT margins in the mid-teens. The segment has around 675,000 paid software subscriptions, with strong ARPU growth driving incremental revenues. Software services also serve as a countercyclical measure for the segment. Ford Pro plans to emerge as a growth engine by accompanying traditional automotive services with software-defined vehicles and connected services to fleet customers..The sustainable methods adopted in this segment, while also ensuring capital efficiency, have provided Ford with a firm foundation and improved capabilities.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years..A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:.2025.2026.2027.2028.2029.2030.2031.2032.2033.2034.

Meanwhile, betting site Polymarket lists only a 30% chance that Tesla (TSLA) launches the service before July, highlighting Musk's rosy predictions on self-driving that have been constantly pushed back..While Tesla is on the verge of starting a new chapter for the company, Alphabet’s (GOOG) Waymo has been quietly racking up mile after mile, trip after trip, providing actual paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin — where Tesla’s test will begin..At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently, but could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver..Waymo has an early lead, and it seems a big one. Rivals like Argo AI and GM-backed Cruise are gone, leaving only smaller players like Zoox (backed by Amazon), China’s Pony AI (PONY), and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla..Waymo (before it was even called that) started off as an in-house startup as part of Google’s X initiative way back in 2009..After some testing and securing of permits, the project officially became Waymo in 2016, and it started testing its Pacifica hybrid vans kitted out with cameras, LIDAR laser sensors, and radar..In 2018 Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker’s I-Pace EV for its testing; these are the vehicles most users are accustomed to seeing..Waymo's combination of vision, radar, and LIDAR, which the company calls its “multimodal” approach, has the company claiming it has the best and safest robotaxi solution..Since 2020, anyone in a service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that the company performs around 250,000 trips a week..A Waymo spokesperson said that the company has not yet seen a vision-only system that can achieve the levels of safety its current system has achieved, asserting that multiple sensors with overlapping fields of view are the best solution..Experts tend to agree..“Waymo is undoubtedly the leader in autonomous driving technology, with their self-driving software (SDS) being widely regarded as best in class,” said University of San Francisco engineering professor William Riggs, an expert in autonomous technology. “They have been around the longest, had patient capital, and have the most miles on the road proving that self-driving tech works.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-waymo-got-the-edge-on-the-competition-and-teslas-robotaxi-so-far-090019552.html,1.

Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it’s free..We're swiping left on Ford for now. Here are three reasons why F doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own..Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful Automobile Manufacturing company because there’s a ceiling to what customers will pay..Over the last two years, Ford failed to grow its vehicles sold, which came in at 971,000 in the latest quarter. This performance was underwhelming and implies there may be increasing competition or market saturation. It also suggests Ford might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability..Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king..As you can see below, Ford’s margin dropped by 13.4 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it’s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Ford’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 5.1%..Debt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency..Ford’s $155.3 billion of debt exceeds the $35.23 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 8× net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $14.21 billion over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged..At this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company’s rating if profitability falls. Ford could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly – a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-f-risky-1-040141412.html,"Credit risk, Market risk, Liquidity risk"

(NYSE:F), explains Alex Tsepaev, the chief strategy officer at B2PRIME Group. What Happened: Unlike globalized ...","Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below..Donald Trump‘s tariffs on steel and aluminum are likely to have a deep impact on the input costs of the U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), explains Alex Tsepaev, the chief strategy officer at B2PRIME Group..What Happened: Unlike globalized automakers like Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), Ford remains deeply tied to U.S.-centric manufacturing, Tsepaev told Benzinga, suggesting that “A 50% tariff could inflate COGS significantly just as pricing power erodes in both EV and ICE segments.”.The cost of goods sold, or COGS, refers to the input costs paid by the firm to manufacture its final products..Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today..Thus, according to Tsepaev, “Trump's call to double steel tariffs hits straight on Ford's core. Steel makes up more than half of the weight of a vehicle, and Ford can't do anything with this reality. In 2018, similar tariffs were estimated to cost Ford over $1 billion annually. When your business runs on metal and tariffs make the metal more expensive, Wall Street notices it.”.Earlier in May, Ford suspended its financial guidance during the first quarter results, which included full-year adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow, due to tariff-related uncertainty. According to Tsepaev, this was due to a 65% decline in profits, with revenues falling to $40 billion..He forecasts that increased input volatility for Ford could lead to downward revisions..“In today's environment, policy uncertainty is the new supply chain risk. For investors, Ford looks exposed, rigid, and margin-constrained in all the wrong places,” Tsepaev added..See Also: Invest Where It Hurts — And Help Millions Heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold..Why It Matters: Trump doubled U.S. tariffs on imported steel from 25% to 50% on May 31, which took effect on June 4..Trump said he initially considered a 40% tariff but raised it after feedback from industry leaders. “At 25% they can sorta get over that fence,” he said, adding, “At 50% nobody’s getting over that fence.”.In 2018, Trump-era tariffs prompted a minor rise in U.S. steel production. However, a 2023 report by the International Trade Commission found that these same tariffs increased costs for downstream industries, leading to a more than $3 billion reduction in output for vehicle, machinery, and tool sectors by 2021, suggesting a net negative economic impact.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-steel-tariffs-hits-straight-183146203.html,1.

That's perfect timing for one of the automotive industry's most highly anticipated presentations: Car Wars, by Bank of America auto analyst John Murphy..This year's edition recently arrived, and it had a few important takeaways for auto investors as well as automakers -- from the young and niche players such as Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), all the way to more historical players such as General Motors (NYSE: GM)..""The unprecedented EV head-fake has wreaked havoc on product plans,"" Murphy said in the bank's annual report, according to CNBC. ""The next four-plus years will be the most uncertain and volatile time in product strategy ever."".The electric vehicle (EV) industry is still growing, but it's just growing in the U.S. at a pace much slower than originally predicted. While countries such as China are testing EV market share around 50%, the U.S. is lagging behind, and the current administration could make things worse by pulling federal support for EVs..But automakers' product plans, designs, and vehicle strategies span years, so changing course surrounding something such as EVs could get expensive, and that's partly what Murphy sees happening..This is important for investors because big changes in plans could mean big charges and write-downs. One example is Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and its $1.9 billion in expenses and write-downs due to the cancellation of its planned electric three-row SUV. And it's just one of what will be many such developments in the coming years..In his report last year, Murphy said, ""I think you have to see the [Detroit Big Three] exit China as soon as they possibly can,"" according to Reuters..Now, the situation in China is even worse, and the brutal price war has engulfed the entire EV industry.

73,2025-06-10 21:43:00,Head-to-Head: Here's How Ford and Toyota Stack Up in the Auto Space,"TM's hybrid gains, global scale and a stronger operational execution give it a lead over F in the evolving auto showdown.","Ford F and Toyota TM are two well-recognized names in the global auto industry and fierce rivals in the U.S. market. Toyota, the Japanese heavyweight, currently holds the No. 2 spot in the U.S. market, selling 2.33 million vehicles last year. That’s a 3.7% increase from 2023. Not far behind is Ford, the homegrown challenger, with 2.07 million vehicles sold, up 4.2% year over year..But the gap widens on a global scale. Toyota’s massive reach helped it move 10.8 million vehicles worldwide in 2024, while Ford sold just 4.5 million. That difference is visible in their market caps too — Toyota is valued at around $250 billion, compared to Ford’s $40 billion..Year to date, shares of Toyota have declined 5.5%, while Ford has grown 4.4%. Nonetheless, both have outperformed the auto sector over the same timeframe..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.So, which stock is the better pick right now? Let’s dig into the fundamentals, growth drivers, and potential risks to see which automaker deserves a spot in your portfolio..Ford remains a key player in the U.S. auto market, with a lineup that continues to resonate with American buyers. The F-Series trucks continue to be a best-seller, and models like the Maverick pickup, Escape, Explorer, Expedition, and Edge keep Ford well-positioned in the SUV and crossover space..The company’s hybrid strategy is paying off. As full EV adoption slows, hybrids are gaining traction. Ford’s growing hybrid sales give it a nice middle ground—appealing to buyers who want better fuel efficiency without fully committing to electric..Financially, Ford is in a relatively strong position. The company exited the first quarter of 2025 with $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity. This provides room to invest in its Ford+ priorities, including digital innovation and electrification. Another appealing factor for Ford’s investors is its dividend, which currently yields roughly 6%, much higher than the S&P 500 average. The company also aims to return 40–50% of free cash flow to shareholders, signaling a continued focus on income investors..Ford Motor Company dividend-yield-ttm | Ford Motor Company Quote.A major growth engine for Ford is its Ford Pro business, which is focused on commercial customers. With strong demand, a successful Super Duty launch and growing interest in its software and service offerings, Ford Pro could become a real earnings driver. Ford’s push into tech and fleet solutions is showing promise..That said, Ford faces real challenges. Its traditional gas-powered vehicle unit, Ford Blue, is under pressure. Sales are expected to fall, and foreign exchange issues could further dent profits. Meanwhile, its EV division, Model e, is bleeding money. Losses reached over $5 billion in 2024 and may continue to rise as competition intensifies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/head-head-heres-ford-toyota-134300759.html,Market Risk

US and Chinese negotiators — decamped to London to hash out their nations’ differences over trade — opted for delivery from one of the British capital’s best Middle Eastern restaurants, Ottolenghi, during an extensive round of talks Monday. It sounds like the hummus went over well..Envoys from the world’s two major economic powers worked through dinner, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the day’s six-hour talks a “good meeting” while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hailed them as “fruitful.” Buoyed by negotiators from the two sides breaking (one assumes pita) bread together, the S&P 500 approached its February high..READ ALSO: New Home Construction Sinks to Lowest Point Since Pandemic and Magnificent 7 May Need to Make Room for Broadcom.The on-off dynamic of the US-China economic relationship so far this year would make the writing rooms of most soap operas blush. President Donald Trump started by increasing tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy, culminating with a 145% tariff on Chinese imports in early April, which prompted China to retaliate with a 125% tariff on US goods in response. In the wake of Trump’s “Liberation Day” levy announcement, the World Trade Organization’s chief economist warned that global trade would fall 0.2% in 2025, ending up 3% below where it would have been without a trade war..Days after the announcement, the S&P plummeted to as much as 19% below its record high of 6,144.15, set on February 19. Markets steadily recovered and banks, which had slashed year-end projections, grew more optimistic. But both sides dug in for leverage in advance of talks: Washington banned the use of advanced Chinese-made microchips and put new restrictions on selling some chip design and jet engine technologies to China. Beijing restricted the export of critical rare earths — which it produces about 90% of — leaving the supply chains of automakers, semiconductor manufacturers, defense firms, and aerospace manufacturers in jeopardy. For markets, Monday yielded a day free of that drama, pointing toward calm:.Kevin Hassett, the head of the White House’s National Economic Council, told CNBC that after a “handshake” between negotiators in London on a deal between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the administration expects that “any export controls from the US will be eased and the rare earths will be released in volume” from the Chinese side. The S&P 500 rose a cautious 0.09% and closed at its highest since February 21, just over 2% away from a new record high..China issued its latest trade figures, showing ample cause for it to make a deal: Export growth slowed to 4.8% year over year in May, down more than three percentage points from April’s 8.1% expansion. More dramatically, rare earth exports fell 48.3% year over year to $18.7 million in May, according to General Administration of Customs data.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/washington-trade-talks-beijing-drive-103000134.html,Geopolitical Risk  Market Volatility Risk  International Trade Risk  Macroeconomic Risk

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Automotive Dive newsletter. .Ford Motor Co. has recalled more than 492,000, 2016-2017 Explorer models for exterior B-pillar door trim on the driver and front passenger side that may become loose or detach while driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration..The recalled trim piece was introduced into production in June 2015. In April 2017, the automaker introduced assembly process improvements to ensure the part was adequately secured. .According to the NHTSA, Ford currently does not have a remedy available for the nearly half a million recalled Explorer models, but it will notify customers about the recall and potential safety risk by June 9. A second letter will be mailed once a remedy is made available. .Ford has been aware of the problem since July 2019, when the company published a technical service bulletin instructing dealership service technicians on how to repair loose B-pillar door trim on the driver’s side of 2011-2019 Explorer models..In the TSB, the automaker cited a potential lack of adhesion of the “front door upper molding to the door.” However, at the time, Ford did not consider the issue an unreasonable risk to safety due to the “low mass/geometry of the part,” and after prior discussions with NHTSA about a separate trim detachment topic in 2018, the details of which were not identified in the recall report..On March 24, the NHTSA’s Office of Defect Investigations notified Ford of 38 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires (VOQs) it received with complaints of driver and/or passenger front door B-pillar trim partially or fully detaching on 2016-2017 Explorers. Following this notification, Ford’s Critical Concern Review Group (CCRG) opened an investigation on March 25..From April through May, Ford’s CCRG and body exterior team investigated the root cause of the trim detachments, which included collecting Explorer doors from scrap yards for analysis at the automaker’s Central Labs facility. The investigation also included a review of photos of parts associated with warranty claims..Ford concluded that the loose trim was a result of improper application of the adhesive wet-out during assembly. Ford’s Field Review Committee then approved a recall on May 16. An estimated 4% of the recalled Explorers are believed to have the defect, according to the recall report. .As of April 7, Ford is aware of 1,482 warranty claims received between Dec. 4, 2015, and Feb. 10, 2025, but is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to loose or detached door trim.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-recalls-492k-suvs-exterior-090300477.html,Product Liability Risk

There's a truth in Detroit for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors, and that's that trucks are king.","Multiple automakers' truck offerings have disappointed in sales..Towing with full-size trucks requires bigger and more costly batteries..Truck enthusiasts may be much slower to adopt EVs..10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›.There's a truth in Detroit for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors, and that's that trucks are king. The dirty little industry secret, if you can call it a secret, is that full-size trucks cost only marginally more to produce than a passenger car, yet the former can sell for two to three times as much..Full-size truck sales are the backbone of Detroit automakers, but as the industry transitions to electric vehicles the scene may be set to change. In fact, the EV industry might have a truck problem, and that would be horrible news for auto investors..Long, long ago Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk essentially mocked stereotypical trucks noting their stale design. Perhaps that's why the young EV maker swung for the fences with the Cybertruck's controversial design..But the unique design didn't stir up sales as much as it stirred conversation. Originally predicted to reach annual sales between 250,000 to half a million units, the Cybertruck has been a commercial flop. It reached only 40,000 U.S. registrations last year, and while that was good enough to be the top EV pickup truck, it was a fraction of original estimates. Because Tesla doesn't break out its sales per model, registrations can serve as a proxy to sales..Ford's highly anticipated F-150 Lightning also disappointed compared to initial hype. Ford noted before the truck's launch it had 200,000 reservations and anticipated producing 150,000 trucks annually. Its actual results were a more modest 24,695 registrations in 2023 before growing to 32,893 in 2024..Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), which only offers the R1T, R1S, and its electric delivery van, relies on its truck for a substantial chunk of its business, but also saw less-than-thrilling results. Rivian last reported its backlog in late 2022 at 114,000 for the R1T and R1S combined, and not only did its registrations of 11,311 feel lackluster in 2023, they actually declined to 9,876 last year..The problem facing investors and their love of truck profits is twofold. On one end, we have the consumer issue, which is the stigma that electric powertrains are forced to their brink when it comes to performance and towing. Consumers that use their trucks as tools sometimes have difficulties with the concept of EVs performing at the required level.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-ev-industry-truck-problem-072300208.html,1.

The company’s Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning EVs have been received well by customers. The segment, however, has failed to generate profits for the company despite continued improvements..After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024, exacerbated by ongoing pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. The segment incurred losses of $849 million in the first quarter of 2025, owing to stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. The company is expected to incur huge losses in its EV business this year as well..The persisting pricing pressures caused by stiff competition in the industry are significantly ailing margins. China’s markets, led by BYD, have been slashing prices, forcing others to follow. The industry also remains prone to supply-chain disruptions. To keep up with the contemporary developments in the industry, Ford has to consistently invest ample amounts..Although the investments are weighing down cash flows, these remain indispensable. Ford is working to improve charging infrastructure throughthe Ford Power Promise campaign, the success of which has already provided customers with a home charger in standard installation. Further plans to drive volumes in the upcoming quarters with recent launches are in place..Toyota Motor Corporation TM, a Japanese auto giant, also remains cautious in its approach toward fully electric vehicles. Toyota’s EVs did not constitute more than 1% of its sales globally in fiscal 2025. This has led Toyota to plan on cutting down its EV production target by 20%, reducing from 1.5 million to 1 million units by 2026. However, the company has started to unveil several new EVs. In China, Toyota launched its most affordable EV, the bZ3X, in March, starting at just over $15,000, to regain the market..Honda HMC, TM’s closest peer, is also cutting down its EV production as global demand remains stunted. Honda rather seems to shift its focus toward hybrid cars, aiming to launch 13 new hybrid models globally between 2027 and 2030. With rising pressure in China and loosened emission targets in the United States, Honda is expecting a rise in hybrids’ popularity, leading to a 30% lowered investment target in EVs..Shares of Ford have lost around 10% year to date against the industry’s growth of 11%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fords-model-e-business-dragging-155800711.html,- Credit Risk - Liquidity Risk - Market Risk - Operational Risk

Quality improvements will take time to filter through Ford's U.S. fleet.,"Ford recently issued two recalls that are not necessarily concerning..The company's higher warranty costs have hurt earnings in the past..Quality improvements will take time to filter through Ford's U.S. fleet..10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›.Let's take a moment to rewind back almost a year ago, when Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) reported second-quarter earnings for 2024..""It's a code-red situation at Ford after a disaster quarter,"" Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in comparison to healthy results at crosstown rival General Motors, according to The Detroit News..Part of Ford's ""disaster"" quarter was due to rising warranty costs, which cover vehicles leaving the factory with defects that later require repairing. In recent years, Ford has continuously found itself near the top in the volume of U.S. vehicles recalled, and it has weighed on the Detroit icon's bottom line..After a couple of recent recalls, is this problem rearing its ugly head again? Not so fast -- let's dig in..In late May, Ford issued a recall for 1,075,299 vehicles in the U.S. over an issue that could prevent the rearview camera from displaying images, which increases the risk of a crash, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)..At first glance, this number is alarming, considering Ford's annual recall volume is generally around 4 million to 6 million total. But not all recalls are created equal, and that's the case here as well..Within months of being contacted by the NHTSA, Ford was able to reproduce the camera failure and fix the software through an over-the-air update, free of charge. That's the clear difference between hardware, which requires a consumer to bring the vehicle to a dealership for repairs, and software that can be fixed over the air..This isn't a recall that's going to cost Ford much, and it certainly won't noticeably weigh on earnings. The next example is a different story..Ford also recently announced that it will recall nearly 30,000 F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks sold in the U.S.. The reason is a suspension nut loosening or missing entirely. The majority of affected vehicles, or 20,528, are from the 2024 model year, with the remaining from the 2025 model..This is where the hardware vs. software aspect comes into play. To fix the issue for affected vehicles, Ford and Lincoln dealers have to inspect the torque of the nut on the ball joint of the left and right upper control arms. If it passes inspection, the nut is replaced; if it fails inspection, the knuckle and nut will be replaced. This is not only a physical process, but far more expensive than a simple over-the-air blast to fix a million vehicles, essentially all at once.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fords-big-problem-rearing-ugly-124500849.html,Operational Risk.

Does that mean the US has won the first big battle of the trade war? Well, it’s complicated..READ ALSO: Can Blue Origin Fill NASA’s SpaceX Void? and BlackRock’s Virtual Investment Analyst ‘Asimov’ Ushers in AI Era on Wall Street.So just how big was the drop? In April, the trade deficit narrowed to just $61.6 billion — way, way, way smaller than the record-setting, Grand Canyon-sized $138.3 billion chasm seen in March. That marks the largest month-over-month deficit contraction on record, according to the Commerce Department, and comes in below consensus expectations of approximately $66 billion. Overall, imports of foreign goods fell about 16% month-over-month to $351 billion, the report said. According to a data analysis by The New York Times combining figures from the Commerce Department and tracking by Moody’s Analytics, the decrease included importing fewer cell phones from China, pharmaceuticals from Switzerland and Ireland, and automotive parts from South Korea, Japan, Mexico, and Canada. Canada reported a record trade deficit of its own on Thursday, of about $5.2 billion (in US currency) in April, as its auto industry gets crushed by tariffs..Curbing America’s reliance on imports was just Step One of the White House’s economic plan. In April, at least, it looks like Mission Accomplished (Note: Economists don’t tend to think deficits are inherently negative). But Step Two in the plan was reviving America’s manufacturing core, and it remains unclear if tariffs will prove an effective tool to that end:.Helping shrink the deficit gap was a 3% bump in US exports to $289.4 billion in April, per the Commerce Department — also good for nearly $16 billion more than recorded in April 2024. From March to April, the US swung from a trade deficit to a trade surplus with several countries, including Australia, Switzerland, and Spain..That said, US manufacturing isn’t exactly thriving under the new stop-and-start tariff regime. Manufacturing activity contracted for the third consecutive month in May, according to an Institute for Supply Management survey released earlier this week, as tariffs spike the prices and delivery times of inputs; the materials shortage has caused particular headaches in the auto industry, with Ford even temporarily halting production at a Chicago plant last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-deliver-record-drop-us-103000628.html,1.

But automakers have been quietly cutting rebates and limiting cheap financing deals, adding hundreds of dollars to buyers’ monthly payments even as the companies say they’re holding the line on pricing. Several have boosted delivery charges — a fee everyone must pay when buying a new vehicle — by $40 to $400 dollars, according to automotive researcher Edmunds.com Inc..Some dealers, meanwhile, have decided to charge more for the cars already on their lots, knowing it will cost more to replace them..These stealth increases could help automakers cope with Trump’s 25% levies on imported vehicles without risking his wrath, particularly once cars that landed in American ports after the tariffs were imposed finally start reaching showrooms this month. They’d all like to avoid the social-media fury he unleashed on Walmart Inc. (WMT) after the retail giant said the trade war had forced it to raise prices..But the auto industry’s subtle price hikes are already having an effect. The average sale price for a new car jumped 2.5% in April, the steepest monthly increase in five years, according to the Kelley Blue Book car buying guide. The average reached $48,699, almost a record. Incentives, which once knocked 10% off the price, fell to 6.7%. Zero-percent financing deals — a key come-on in this age of high interest rates — dropped in April to their lowest rate since 2019, according to researcher Cox Automotive. And at some point, car buyers may balk..“On the consumer side, they’re seeing several thousand dollars of actual-experience price increase, whereas the factory is saying, ‘No man, we didn’t raise prices at all,’” said Morris Smith III, a Ford (F) dealer in Kansas. “Stealth is a good word for it.”.While the steps have helped car companies avoid outright price hikes until now, those are coming. Ford Motor Co. told dealers it will raise sticker prices as much as $2,000 on three models it builds in Mexico — the Maverick pickup, the Bronco Sport and the electric Mustang Mach-E. Japan’s Subaru Corp. (FUJHY) is boosting prices $1,000 to $2,000 to help offset tariff costs, according to people familiar with the matter. Hyundai Motor Co. (HYMLF) is considering a 1% increase to the suggested retail price of every model in its lineup, a hike of at least several hundred dollars, Bloomberg reported last week. The Korean company also is likely to jack up shipping charges and fees for options such as floor mats and roof rails, which could turn off some inflation-weary consumers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carmakers-stealth-price-hikes-cope-100019846.html,1.

Wards Intelligence reported that the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of light vehicle sales in May dropped to 15.65 million units from a revised 17.25 million in April and 17.83 million in March. Cox Automotive also saw a similar drop in its May SAAR calculation..The ""hangover for vehicle sales has set in,"" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a note to client this week..""Headwinds for vehicle sales are unlikely to change quickly as consumers remain pessimistic, inventory on dealer lots is declining, and there could be additional payback from front-running of tariff increases,"" Sweet wrote..In addition to declining inventory leading to higher prices as dealers replace supply with higher-priced vehicles, consumer sentiment will also weigh on sales..Read more: How your vehicle's make and model affect car insurance costs.""Though sentiment generally explains little of the fluctuation in real consumer spending, particularly in the short run, confidence matters more for certain segments of consumer spending,"" Sweet noted. ""As our past work has shown, sentiment shocks take a heavy toll [on] durable goods consumption, which includes big-ticket items that typically require financing and are often the first areas consumers cut back."".Oxford and Sweet see ""the peak impact of tariffs on inflation occurring this summer."".Sweet adds that lower inventory, higher prices, depressed sentiment, and weak income growth will weigh on auto sales.

At the same time, China cracked down on illegal smuggling of the valuable elements that had made previous export curbs less effective. Last year, China halted exports of three rare minerals critical for making computer chips, EV batteries, and military weapons systems..Now, auto manufacturing seems to be the first major industry feeling the effects of its mineral deficiency:.Ford temporarily stopped churning out SUVs at a Chicago plant last week because of a shortage of magnets, which are used not only in electric vehicle power systems but also in various components of gas-powered cars, such as power windows and headlights.

For now, the auto industry has a stockpile of magnets to fall back on, but it’s only expected to last a few months at most..Digging Deep: The US has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to bring rare earth production stateside since 2020, but it’s still in the early stages of building the complicated supply chain (rare earths require more than 100 steps to process). In the meantime, US officials are pushing for access to Ukraine’s rare earths, while automakers are trying to develop parts that require fewer or no rare earths. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to have a discussion this week that’ll highlight export restrictions. It could be a tad awkward after Trump posted on social media that Xi is “VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH.”.This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

For more on the latest numbers and the state of the auto industry, let's welcome in here Kevin Roberts, Car Gurus's director of economic and market intelligence. Kevin, always good to see you. So, auto sales for May, Kevin, just looking, I mean, nice sales gains. I'm looking at Ford sales jumped about 16%, Kevin. Truck sales, strong, hybrid strong, EV not great. Toyota looks like an increase about 7% in May. We heard from Hyundai and Kia as well. Just broadly, when you looked over that data, Kevin, how would you characterize it? What would you make of it? .Yeah, it was, uh, I would say a return to normal. So, uh, I like to say end of March, early April was kind of a crazy time for the auto industry when the tariffs were first announced. May was a little bit more back to normal, uh, traditionally a really strong kind of sales month for the industry. Um, you know, end of tax season, we have, uh, Memorial Day sales. So that's been really kind of helpful for the industry. And you mentioned it, several automakers really had some strong months. Couple things I think really kind of helped there. Ford had their employee pricing for all, uh, you know, vehicle affordability has been a trend we've really been highlighting for a while now. So I think that kind of discounts really kind of helped drive sales there. And then you mentioned hybrids. That's one that helped for both Ford and Toyota. Um, hybrid sales continue to see really strong growth. Consumers really like hybrids, and Ford and particularly Toyota are really dominant in hybrid power trains, which is helping to drive sales. .Do you think we saw some pull forward in those numbers too, though, Kevin? You know, folks trying to get ahead of tariffs? .That is the million dollar question for the auto industry right now. Uh, how much, if if we did see pull ahead, how much did we see pull ahead? And where might that start to bite back? Um, you know, was that kind of Q2 sales towards the end of the quarter that we pulled that from, or was it later in the year? It's really an unknown at this point. Uh, did we just kind of shake people off the sidelines who, you know, weren't in the market, or did we kind of pull ahead a lot of volume, uh, in those kind of crazy weeks after the tariffs were announced? And it's, it's, it's a major unknown for the industry right now. .Kevin, you know, tariffs in place. So do you think these automakers, do they maintain pricing, Kevin, or would you expect, no, starting here in June, perhaps, we're, we're going to see prices start rising? .Yeah, so we've been monitoring what's been happening to the average list price of vehicles on the site. Uh, somewhat surprising, we haven't seen large shifts, uh, to this point. However, like you said, a lot of automakers I think we're kind of in a wait and see approach after the tariffs were announced. And we're starting to see a trickle of some announcements of, uh, price increases as we get into June. Uh, and that's going to be a trend we kind of monitor, um, to see if that continues and if we start to see some of that expected price inflation, uh, for vehicles as we move into the second half of the year. .What did you make of the reaction in some names, um, this week, Kevin, for GM, for example, moving lower as Trump talked tough on steel tariffs? .Yeah, so it, it's a little bit of a different situation than if we would have talked a month or two ago. Uh, we had another executive order signed towards the end of April, uh, which gave hierarchy to stop stacking of a number of tariffs. And so that should stop, um, section 232 auto tariffs from being stacked with those steel and aluminum tariffs. So there is some protection for the auto industry. Now, it's important to keep in mind that those, that kind of protection only exists for, uh, finished vehicles and parts covered in those tariffs specifically. So for parts not covered there, we could see an impact there. And I think that's what you, that, uh, uh, that kind of risk is where you're seeing that shift this week. .By the way, should kind of just see a breaking news headline here. Uh, according to the White House, UK steel tariffs, they're going to remain at 25% for now. Um, lastly, Kevin, on Tesla, I want your views there. There, we did get some numbers this week. Broadly, weak sales for Tesla in Europe. What do you make of that, Kevin? Is that branding? Is that, you know, the Model Y change over? Is that more competition for Musk over there? Is it all three? .So, uh, we, Tesla is a direct to consumer automaker, so we don't get their data in, in our listing data, so a little bit difficult to say there. What I can say from the used side of the market, even with all the noise around Tesla recently, still, uh, still seems pretty strong, uh, demand for used Teslas out in the marketplace. So can't, can't comment as much on the new side of the market, but used side still sees, uh, uh, strong interest for used Teslas. .Interesting. Kevin, always great to have you on the show. Thanks so much for your time. .My pleasure. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/auto-sales-see-return-normal-214420358.html,Market Risk  Regulatory Risk  Trade War Risk

Yahoo Finance's senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian has the latest. Pras, let's start off with Ford. You said there was strength by the way across the board, but let's kick it off with Ford. .Yes, so far, so far. Big gains by Ford but for how long is is is the question there. So, Ford sales up 16% led by trucks and SUVs. Hybrid surging too, still very popular amongst Ford customers in the US. Uh now Ford introduced employee pricing, uh, right soon soon after the tariffs were announced. Uh, it was seen as sort of a cynical move but they it actually worked. They're eating into market gains, they're getting market gains there through that, that pricing program. Uh, so that's a good move there. Um, the question is how long they can be they can maintain that, right? Price hikes are coming. They've already said models made in Mexico like the Maverick and the Mustang Mach-E you're gonna get price hikes too. So, real quick also the Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia, both doing well. Hyundai up 8%, Kia up 5%. Uh, Hyundai kept pricing the same through June 2nd. Sorry, June 3rd now. So the question is how long are they gonna make are they gonna raise prices? Are they gonna keep the same? Can they even cut prices? We'll see. .And what are you hearing about how these companies are thinking through the price increases when the tariff policy continues to change? .I mean, the tariff policy for at least with autos is has been the same. Uh, 2.5% since April 2nd or 3rd. Uh, now countries like the UK had a trade deal where they went to 10%. So that's helping them out. So the the Koreans and and in the USMCA they're waiting for can we get some pricing relief here from tariffs. It hasn't been the case so far. The ink is not yet dry or even wet on any of these deals. That's the big question. So, uh, I think you're right about with with Hyundai and Kia in particular, they're trying to move as much production as they can to the US, and that's a tough move. So, uh, we'll see because right now they're they're probably eating into their profit margins right now, uh, and they but they don't want to lose customers, they want to lose market gains or or some market share here, and that's sort of that balance, right? Is how do I maintain market my market share without destroying my profits? .How much of the price increases can they actually pass through? Is it a portion of it? And then how many, you know, percentage-wise? And are some some automakers having a different perspective than others in terms of their their plan here? .Yeah, you know, so so for instance, uh, Porsche for instance has said that they want to pass on as much, not they'd want to, but they're going to pass on as much as they can to the the consumer because they have a a product set that people want, right? 911 sports cars are highly desirable. You can maybe pass on a good amount of that tariff uh, price change to them. Cars in a competitive price price set, volume cars, mid-market cars, you can't pass on that much to the consumer because they're gonna get hit by another by another competitor. So that's a problem. .And to that end, which automakers stand to potentially use this as an opportunity to eke out market share from competitors by keeping prices low. Does anyone have that luxury? .So Ford just just is blowing it out of the water because they're they did that employee pricing, and I heard other automakers complain about that like, ""Why are they doing that? I don't understand."" This is why they're doing it because they're seeing it as an opportunity to say, ""Hey Americans, we're going to help you out here. We know price hikes are coming. We're gonna lower prices for you."" And that was a good sort of PR marketing goodwill move by them. Hats off to them for doing that. Other automakers saying, ""We might want to preserve our sort of pricing power here and our and our profits here and maybe do that later."" And maybe you'll see other automakers follow that in those footsteps, but right now you see the Ford warning at 1.5 billion in lost profits, GM almost potentially 5 billion without mitigation efforts and lost profits. So that's where we're standing. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ford-kia-automakers-approaching-pricing-150152697.html,1. Economic Risk 2. Business Risk 3. Market Risk

The Trump administration has said the decision to reduce tariffs hinged on a Chinese agreement to lift controls on some rare earths..The US is “aggressively moving to onshore critical supply chains, including the production of magnets,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The administration is actively monitoring China’s compliance with the Geneva trade agreement and President Trump will speak directly with President Xi very soon.”.As China keeps constraints on metals critical to America’s national security, Washington is ramping up tech restrictions. In recent weeks, the US has barred the shipping of critical jet engine parts to China, throttled Beijing’s access to chip-design software and slapped fresh curbs on Huawei Technologies Co. chips..That’s sparked anger in world’s second-largest economy. Chinese officials on Monday vowed to respond and accused the US of undermining the Geneva consensus, dimming the chance of a leaders call..For years, Washington was believed to have the advantage over China in the fight for technological dominance thanks to its grip on semiconductor supply chains. Xi has shown he’s ready to fight back, in part by tightening controls over critical minerals in a bid to force the US into easing its restrictions..While the Trump administration has shown little sign of relenting on chip curbs, it has discovered replacing China as a supplier of rare earths could take years and cause pain for key industries. The Asian nation produces almost 70% of the world’s metals crucial for making fighter jets, nuclear reactor control rods and other critical technology..Washington is still a decade away from securing rare earths independently from Beijing, said Cory Combs, associate director at consultancy Trivium China who specializes in supply chains, noting that Chinese firms have developed capable alternatives to most US chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-rare-earths-grip-gives-151513862.html,Geopolitical Risk Trade Risk Supply Chain Risk

That's why they're willing to call out Trump's tariffs as the cause.,"If prices go up, do you care why?.Businesses certainly think so, which is why they’re calling out the Trump tariffs, even at the risk of provoking a combative president..Trump’s new taxes on imported goods haven’t reignited inflation yet, but many economists think they’re about to. Overall, Trump has raised the average tariff on some $3 trillion of imported goods from 2.5% to about 18%. Most goods on shelves now come from pre-tariff inventories. But those supplies will soon start to run out, and many goods — including clothing, medicine, appliances, toys, cars, and car parts — will bear the higher cost of tariffs that in most cases add 10% to 30% to the cost of imported goods..The battle is fully underway over who should get the blame when higher prices hit consumers. Companies such as Walmart (WMT), Mattel (MAT), Microsoft (MSFT), and Ford (F) have said openly that tariffs will lead to higher costs for consumers. Trump has fired back, saying American businesses should “eat” the tariffs by fully absorbing the higher costs without charging consumers more..Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet.Trump’s bully megaphone works, to some extent. Amazon (AMZN) considered, then abandoned, a plan to highlight the added cost of tariffs in a line item on its website, then backed down when Trump complained to executive chair Jeff Bezos. Some companies hope to avoid Trump’s ire by using elliptical language to explain price hikes. Subaru  (7270.T), for instance, recently said it’s raising the price of several models because of “current market conditions,” with no mention of tariffs..But there's thorough evidence that consumers will end up bearing the cost of Trump's tariffs, and the blame game will intensify as consumers start to notice higher prices and get angry at… somebody. Businesses see it coming, and they have good reasons for trying to head off another hit to their reputation..Many consumers already blame corporate America for the elevated inflation that began in 2021 and peaked at a punishing 9% in 2022.

106,2025-06-02 22:01:00,Shortage of Rare-Earth Magnets Endangers US Vehicle Production,"Rare-earth magnet supply shortages from China threaten U.S. auto production, putting key parts and plant operations at risk.","Top global auto executives are warning of an imminent shortage of rare-earth magnets from China, essential components in systems like windshield wipers and anti-lock brakes, which could lead to U.S. car plant shutdowns within weeks.In a previously undisclosed letter dated May 9 to the Trump administration, the head of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents General Motors Company GM, Ford Motor Company F, Volkswagen AG VWAGY, and major automakers, raised alarm over the shortage of rare-earth magnets from China.Per the letter, without consistent access to these elements and magnets, auto suppliers would be unable to manufacture vital automotive parts such as transmissions, throttle bodies, alternators, sensors, motors, lights, seat belts, power steering systems, speakers and cameras. Losing access to these critical components would soon disrupt U.S. vehicle production. Per Alliance CEO John Bozzella, the matter was discussed during Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer’s recent meetings with Chinese officials in Geneva. Per Greer, while China had agreed to ease export restrictions, it was not moving swiftly enough to restore access for key U.S. industries..China, which controls more than 90% of global processing for these magnets, used in everything from vehicles and military aircraft to household electronics, had introduced new rules in April requiring exporters to secure licenses from Beijing. Exports of rare-earth magnets from China dropped by half in April as companies struggled with a complicated and unclear permit application process, which can require hundreds of pages of documentation.President Donald Trump, in a social media post, accused China of breaking the terms of a recent agreement meant to ease tariffs and trade restrictions. In response, China’s embassy in Washington claimed it was the United States, not China, that was misusing export controls, particularly in the semiconductor industry.A U.S. official familiar with the discussions told Reuters that the Geneva talks only addressed tariffs and China’s non-tariff trade measures, not U.S. export controls. Per the official, China was slow to deliver on its promise to issue export licenses for rare-earth materials. This delay could prompt retaliatory actions from Washington if U.S. automakers, already at risk due to the shortage, are forced to halt production.So far, only a few licenses have been approved, including for some Volkswagen suppliers. Meanwhile, Indian car manufacturers reported they haven’t received any permits and may have to shut down production as early as June.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shortage-rare-earth-magnets-endangers-140100181.html,Supply Chain Disruption Risk

The repairs will be free and owner notifications letters are expected to be mailed June 16..The NHTSA notified Ford of the problem on Jan. 17, after receiving rearview camera complaints from customers driving 2021-2023 Ford F-150 pickup models. The agency provided the company with 37 vehicle owner questionnaires (VOQs) related to backup camera display issues. .Ford’s Automotive Safety Office reviewed the VOQs and found 15 reports of the issue, with 18 related to APIM software and four others which alleged an intermittent or persistent loss of the rearview camera image that were “not categorized,” according to the NHTSA..Though further investigation by Ford’s Critical Concern Review Group (CCRG) between February and April, engineers reproduced the camera failure and traced it to specific SYNC4 software versions installed in the vehicles..Between April 2 and May 1, Ford’s CCRG reviewed service records and OTA software data to determine if other versions of its SYNC software could lead to backup camera issues. However, its investigation determined that only vehicles equipped with SYNC4 software versions 1.7 through 1.9 experienced camera issues. All of the recalled vehicles are suspected of having these software versions..Ford’s investigators also identified 232 warranty claims of backup camera faults in the North America market, leading Ford's Field Review Committee to approve the recall on May 2. .According to the NHTSA recall report, the problem is described as an “improper operational sequencing within the wireless communication subsystem of the SYNC software,” which may cause unexpected system resets. If the backup camera system restarts while the vehicle is in reverse, the center infotainment screen may freeze, show a delayed image or black screen. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-recalls-over-1m-vehicles-090200235.html,- Risk Classification: Product Liability - Risk Subcategory: Safety Recall - Risk Severity: Moderate to High - Risk Impact: Consumer Product

If that were to happen, it would harm the business case in Marshall, said Bill Ford..“We have built the business case on Marshall around that,” the chairman told reporters after a panel discussion at the Mackinac Policy Conference. “My point is politicians can agree or disagree whether those kind of things are desirable, and that’s fine. But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness, and that’s unfair.”.The company likely will press hard to change the language of the final bill to ensure the factory, located about 107 miles West of Detroit and set to launch production next year, makes it to the finish line. While some lawmakers are seeking to keep tax credits away form “foreign entities of concern,” as CATL is labeled in the proposed bill, the factory in Marshall would create 1,700 jobs and serve as an economic catalyst, the automaker and proponents has argued..Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected..“I don’t know the likelihood, but I do know that if it goes away, it puts in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan,” he said..The chairman made the remarks after an on-stage interview alongside his daughter and Ford board member Alexandra Ford English at the Mackinac Policy Conference. The discussion, moderated by former TV anchor Christy McDonald, centered on the father-daughter dynamics in one of America’s most famous family businesses..Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, is the automaker’s fourth leader named Ford in its more than 120-year existence. English was elected to the automaker’s influential board of directors in 2021, along with her cousin Henry Ford III, son of Edsel B. Ford II, a former board member and director at the company..English began her career in retail, working at Gap Inc. and Tory Burch. Even if she had wanted to jump straight from college to the automaker, her father wouldn’t have allowed it. Bill Ford’s rule is that family members cannot go right into the business..“We cannot be a family employment agency,” Ford said. “We want to make sure the young people that come into our company are incredibly well qualified and motivated.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ford-says-michigan-battery-213254908.html,Regulatory Risk Industry Risk Company Risk Financial Risk

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford's projected $3 billion investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant that is 60% complete and slated to employ 1,700 workers.

""We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made."".Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026..The tax-reform bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms..Ford’s factory would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL..""I'm spending a lot of time talking about that with politicians. It's a federal issue, but it's also a state issue,"" Ford said on Thursday..Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company..The company touted a letter from more than 100 Marshall-area business owners, school leaders, elected officials calling on Congress to retain the tax incentives, which noted the area has ""lost thousands of jobs over the past several years."".The House bill would also end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..Good news, investors! Ford Motor is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $13.76, but it is currently trading at US$10.31 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.. View our latest analysis for Ford Motor .Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Ford Motor. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation..Are you a shareholder? Since F is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation..Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on F for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy F. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-ford-140017453.html,Market Risk: High Company-Specific Risk: Medium Regulatory Risk: Low Event Risk: Low Liquidity Risk: Medium

If access to short-term debt tightensdue to a recession, rate spike, or market shockthese companies may find themselves trying to refinance obligations while still on the hook for multi-year consumer loans..This article analyzes Ford's financial structure and compares it with peers: GM, Toyota, Subaru, Ally, and CACC. We examine two critical areas: capital investment per vehicle and the maturity profile of automotive and financial debt..A key metric of capital efficiency is how much fixed investment (PP&E) and finance exposure (receivables) a company carries per vehicle produced..Ford's capital efficiency is middlingbetter than GM, but behind both Toyota and Subaru. The high fixed investment per car reflects Ford's transitional asset base: older factories across North America combined with newer plants built for electrification..Subaru, meanwhile, stands out as a model of discipline. With relatively modest fixed assets and a light financing footprint, Subaru runs leanoutsourcing customer loans and focusing on a simplified product line..Ford stands out not only for the steepness of its maturity profile, but also for the absolute scale of its debt. Among all peers analyzed, Ford has both the highest total debt load and the most front-loaded maturity schedule, placing it in a uniquely exposed position should credit markets tighten. Ford Credit is heavily reliant on short-term borrowing..Nearly half of its obligations come due within the next three years, putting pressure on the company to continuously access short-term capital markets. Not only are Ford's maturities the steepest, but it also carries the largest overall debt burden among its peersboth in absolute terms and relative to near-term obligations. This dual pressure makes Ford Credit uniquely exposed to disruptions in short-term capital markets..This risk is amplified by industry trends:.Higher loan-to-value ratios: In 2024, the average LTV reached ~97.5%, up from 93% in 2020..Longer loan terms: Nearly half of all auto loans now stretch beyond 72 months. That's six yearsalready beyond the horizon of Ford Credit's visible debt maturity schedulemeaning the company could be holding loan risk longer than it holds the funding used to issue it.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-finance-future-190724122.html,Financial Risk Operational Risk Market Risk Liquidity Risk

Ford's free cash flow was already on track to fall even before the impact of tariffs.  UPS's free cash flow has also felt the impact of tariffs.,"Enbridge backs its high-yielding payout with very stable cash flow..Ford's free cash flow was already on track to fall even before the impact of tariffs..UPS's free cash flow has also felt the impact of tariffs..10 stocks we like better than United Parcel Service ›.High-yield dividend stocks are alluring if you like to collect dividend income. In theory, the higher a stock's dividend yield, the more income you can generate from every dollar you invest. The reality is that higher-yielding dividend stocks often have higher risk profiles. .When it comes to high yields, Ford (NYSE: F), UPS (NYSE: UPS), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) certainly look enticing. Their payouts range from nearly 6% for Ford and Enbridge to almost 7% for UPS. That's significantly higher than the S&P 500's sub-1.5% dividend yield. .However, only Enbridge offers a very bankable income stream. That's why you should buy the energy stock to earn income while skipping the high-yield payouts of Ford and UPS..Enbridge operates a diversified energy infrastructure platform built around stable utility and pipeline operations. Its four core franchises -- liquids pipelines, gas transmission and midstream, gas distribution and storage, and renewable power -- produce very stable cash flow, with 98% coming from cost-of-service or contracted frameworks. The company's low-risk business model produces extremely predictable results. Enbridge has achieved its annual financial guidance for 19 years in a row. That's impressive, considering it experienced two significant recessions --- the financial crisis and the pandemic -- and several other periods of energy market volatility. .The company pays out 60% to 70% of its stable cash flow in dividends each year. It also has a strong investment-grade balance sheet. That provides it with billions of dollars of annual capacity to invest in organic expansions and bolt-on acquisitions. Enbridge has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured expansion projects that should come online through the decade's end. The company estimates that it has the fuel to grow its cash flow per share at a 3% to 5% annual rate in the future. That should enable it to increase its dividend by around a similar annual rate, further extending its growth streak, which hit 30 straight years in 2025. .Ford has a spotty track record of paying dividends. The iconic automaker has had to suspend its dividend twice over the past couple of decades because of adverse market conditions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ultra-high-yield-dividend-123800415.html,1.

If we zoom out and look at the past decade, shares of the Detroit automaker have generated a total return, including dividends reinvested, of just 16% (as of May 22). This pales in comparison to the 228% total return of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)..Ford is an icon of the American economy. I don't believe anyone will argue that. But should you buy this auto stock right now? Let's consider key bull and bear arguments that can better inform investors about their decision..By simply looking at the stock price, investors will find a clear reason to be bullish. That's because the valuation is so low. As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 8.3. Given the valuation of the overall market, investors are likely struggling to find any businesses that provide this type of perceived value..Consequently, Ford pays a hefty dividend yield of 7.2%. Most investors might only care about capital appreciation. However, there are undoubtedly some market participants who would love to add this income stream to their portfolios. .Ford Model e, the company's EV segment, continues to burn cash. But the rest of the business, which includes the legacy Blue segment, as well as the Pro segment that focuses on commercial customers, remains firmly profitable. .Ford is a leader when it comes to pickup trucks and SUVs. And in the commercial division, the company is creating high-margin and recurring revenue, with a focus on software and subscriptions. This could have positive implications for the future of the company..Assuming that most readers are looking to pick individual stocks in an effort to outperform the S&P 500 in the next decade and beyond, Ford provides no shortage of reasons to be extremely pessimistic. There are some very unfavorable traits of the business that should make quality-minded investors pump the brakes..Ford's cyclicality is something to keep in mind. To be fair, this isn't specific to this company, as it's something nearly all automakers must deal with. Because cars are usually the second-largest purchase a person will make in a lifetime (after their home), a lot of thought and planning goes into the decision. When times get tough and money is tight, it makes sense that this purchase can be delayed. Pressured demand will have a negative impact on Ford's sales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-buy-now-161000571.html,1. Market Volatility Risk 2. Economic Downturn Risk 3. Business Risk 4.

Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable.

The list of companies announcing price changes as a result is equally daunting.,"President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have given many Americans whiplash. The list of companies announcing price changes as a result is equally daunting..Among the levies Trump has imposed is a 10% baseline tariff for most imports and a 30% tariff on most Chinese goods. Some goods, such as steel and aluminum, face higher rates..Many retailers have issued warnings that they won’t, as Trump has suggested, “eat” the additional costs caused by those import taxes. That means anything from groceries and clothing to toys and cars could cost Americans more..Walmart is one of the latest major retailers to say it would sell more expensive goods soon because Trump’s tariffs are “too high.” Other retailers suggesting they could hike prices soon include Ford, Best Buy and others..Here are some of the companies that could raise prices on everyday items – whether or not companies are directly blaming Trump’s tariffs..Walmart said on April 15 it would increase prices because Trump’s tariffs were “too high,” particularly when it came to products made in China..“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said in an earnings call..Price changes at Walmart will likely take effect by the end of May and prices will increase “much more” in June, the company’s chief financial officer John David Rainey, told CNBC..On May 6, toy manufacturing giant Mattel said that it would raise prices due to tariffs. Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz told investors that “under the current scenarios we are considering” in response to tariffs, he expects 40% to 50% of its products to remain priced at $20 or less. However, he also advocated for zero tariffs on toys and games around the world..Trump threatened Mattel, saying he would “put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market.”.Electronics retailer Best Buy warned during a March earnings call that “vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.”.Some electronic components and devices are temporarily exempt from Trump’s tariffs. That won’t last forever..Nintendo, for instance, delayed the pre-order date for its Switch 2 video game console because of concerns regarding tariffs. The company later said pricing for the console won’t change from the initial $450, but the accessories “will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions.” The same could happen to any product because of “market conditions,” the company noted.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-raise-prices-because-trump-130050640.html,1.

Trump has a history of not following through on these warnings.","President Trump threatened Apple (AAPL) on Friday with 25% duties on overseas-made iPhones, the latest entry in a long list of company-specific tariff threats from the president stretching back to his first term in office..He also has a history of not following through on these warnings, often ending them with a claim of victory or by simply dropping the issue..Trump himself alluded to the frequency of his threats, writing Friday that he ""long ago informed [Apple CEO] Tim Cook"" of his position and his focus on iPhone manufacturing in India. The president added that not complying would take the form of a tariff that ""must be paid by Apple to the U.S."".The companies that Trump has singled out in a similar manner since his first administration range from John Deere (DE) to General Motors (GM) and others. He has also made previous threats against Apple dating back to 2016, even before he took office..""Companies like Apple will start making their iPhones and other products inside the United States,"" Trump promised that year when part of his first campaign's platform was 35% tariffs on companies if they move overseas..In recent weeks, Trump has also called out at least four other companies by name — Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Ford (F), and Mattel (MAT) — over the possibility that they could raise prices due to tariffs..The threats from Trump do have the ability to affect investor sentiment. Apple's stock fell more than 2% on Friday morning following Trump's warning, issued on Truth Social..In Apple’s case, in spite of Trump’s years of threats and the recent opening of new US Apple manufacturing facilities around AI and silicon engineering, no iPhones are currently made in the United States now, as in 2016, and that isn’t seen as likely to change anytime soon..Wedbush analyst Dan Ives quickly reacted to Trump’s threat by posting that a scenario of Apple acceding to Trump “would result in an iPhone price point [of ~$3,500 and] that is a non-starter for Cupertino."".He offered more details as to why in a note to investors, citing an “upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative.”.Also Friday morning, Trump announced he was ""recommending"" a 50% tariff on the European Union in a separate post that quickly drove down broader markets alongside the Apple broadside..Another company often in focus for Trump during his most recent presidential campaign was John Deere, with Trump last September promising a 200% tariff on the company over ""everything that you want to sell into the United States"" amid concerns that the company would move operations to Mexico.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-threatens-apple-with-tariffs-he-has-been-making-such-threats-since-2016-151849148.html,Economic Risk Market Volatility Risk Currency Risk Trade War Risk Supply Chain Risk

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ford F, Nissan NSANY and Honda HMC..Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:.U.S. auto biggie Ford is scaling back its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions once again—this time by opening the doors of its battery plant to a rival. In a move that highlights the growing pressure facing automakers, Ford will allow Japan's Nissan to use part of its underutilized Kentucky battery facility. This factory was originally part of Ford's $7 billion EV investment push in 2021, built in partnership with South Korea's SK On. Today, one plant sits idle, and only a portion of the other is producing batteries. Now that part will make batteries for both Nissan and Ford..Partnering with Nissan will help absorb excess capacity.Nissan incurred a $4.5 billion loss in the last reported quarter and just scrapped plans for a battery plant in Japan. Local U.S. production will help reduce its tariff exposure, which is a strategic move by Nissan..Nissan's peer Honda is also rethinking its EV roadmap. As global demand cools, Honda is slashing its EV and software investment target by nearly a third and pivoting toward hybrids. Honda now plans to launch 13 new hybrid models globally by 2030, while scaling back expectations for fully electric vehicles..These moves underscore the challenges Ford and other automakers are facing as EV demand stalls and costs climb. Ford has suspended its full-year 2025 guidance, citing tariff-related uncertainties. The company incurred a $5.07 billion EV loss in 2024, and we expect another $5 billion at least in red ink this year..At this stage, investors may be wondering if the automaker still has a compelling long-term case. Let's dig into the investment thesis..Ford is navigating through some tough terrain. One of the biggest hurdles is the impact of Trump tariffs, which are expected to cost the company a staggering $2.5 billion. While Ford plans to cushion the blow by offsetting $1 billion through various efficiency and cost-cutting measures, the remaining $1.5 billion hit in 2025 looms large. With potential retaliatory tariffs and ongoing supply chain disruptions, the road ahead remains unpredictable. On a broader scale, tariffs could slash U.S. auto industry sales by around 500,000 units, a drop that would undoubtedly weigh on Ford's own sales and bottom line.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-ford-140400135.html,"Low Market Sentiment Risk, Moderate Financial Risk"

Ford (NYSE: F) stock plummeted in early April on the initial tariff rollout but has since rebounded and is up nearly 9% year to date..But investors may want to temper their enthusiasm. Ford continues to face significant headwinds on multiple fronts. Here's why Ford stock isn't a millionaire maker and why it's probably best to avoid it right now..The Trump administration said recently that it wouldn't ""stack"" automotive tariffs on top of each other. For example, a steel tariff wouldn't be applied to imported auto parts that have already undergone a tariff. Moreover, the administration said automakers could receive a rebate on some tariffs for the first two years..But the damage has already been done to Ford and its peers. The company pulled its full-year guidance for 2025 and said tariffs will cost $1.5 billion this year, even after attempts to offset some of the impact..To understand just how much the tariff turmoil is hurting Ford, consider that the company's previous guidance was for about $8 billion in earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) for the full year. Yet the company had just $1 billion in EBIT earnings for its first quarter, far below the pace required to meet that goal, which was set just three months ago..Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the company's earnings call that, ""it's still too early to fully understand our competitors' responses to these tariffs.

But what could Trump do if he's serious about trying to make companies quote unquote eat the increases? Here with Moga who finances Ben Worshkol. So how could he sort of make good on some of his threats, Ben? .Sure thing. So, he's, so President Trump has offered kind of harsh words for four retailers so far on around around tariff price hikes: Walmart, Amazon, Ford, and Mattel. And the strategy so far is kind of a public pressure one. It kind of so-called name and shame. He told Walmart, ""I'll be watching."" But what I looked at for the story is what options are available to the president if he decides to go further. And the bottom line is there's quite a few. Experts point to things like a federal trade commission investigation by sector, other government investigations around issues like specific products and or profits, capital hill legislation. There's some ideas there and then the big one would be price controls via executive order. But the interesting thing about all these tools is that if Trump were to avail and him and his folks aren't saying whether any are under consideration. The the man he might have the most to thank for this is Joe Biden because a lot of these are tools that the Biden administration availed themselves to for very different reasons. They essentially stress tested them around around charges of price gouging during inflation. There was an investigation on meat packers for example, that that could be very similar if Trump were to go further. And this is all part of a larger trend. There's a economist at the Cato Institute named Ryan Bourne, I spoke to for the story, who talks about sort of a bipartisan push towards increasing government intervention, especially on prices. It's essentially a building up of government, both the bureaucratic and the legal apparatus to to be more involved in in in private business pricing decisions. How this specific with Trump plays out, it remains to be seen. Again, the Trump administration isn't saying that they're they're pondering this beyond the kind of, ""I'll be watching you,"" message that they're sending. But but Bourne and others make a pretty convincing case that interventions by companies could become more common in the years ahead because of because of what they're they're building up in in both the Biden and the Trump administration. .Ben, thank you.

But so far, only one of the two plants is partially operating, while the other sits idle. Now, the active site is likely to produce batteries not just for Ford, but also for Nissan, indicating a shift from exclusive internal use to a more open, revenue-generating model..This change comes as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) steps back from earlier EV plans. In early 2024, the company said it was rethinking its approach, including whether it still needed to make batteries in-house. It has already delayed or scaled back $12 billion in EV spending, citing rising costs, softening demand, and uncertainty over tariffs..Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s EV unit posted a $5 billion loss in 2024 and is bracing for another $5 billion hit this year. The company recently withdrew its full-year financial guidance, again pointing to concerns over tariffs as a key factor..A Ford spokeswoman redirected questions regarding the Kentucky battery facility to its BlueOval SK joint venture. Meanwhile, a representative from the venture chose not to comment on the possibility of Nissan becoming a client..Although Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) hasn’t officially confirmed Nissan’s involvement, the deal could work to both companies' advantage. For Nissan, using a U.S. plant helps reduce exposure to import tariffs and supply chain disruptions, at a time when it's also under pressure, having posted a $4.5 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025..F has surged by nearly 9% in 2025 so far..While we acknowledge the potential of F to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.  If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than F and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock..READ MORE: 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024 and 10 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.Disclosure.

Dividend yield is solid, and so are the EV losses.","U.S. auto biggie Ford F is scaling back its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions once again—this time by opening the doors of its battery plant to a rival. In a move that highlights the growing pressure facing automakers, Ford will allow Japan’s Nissan NSANY to use part of its underutilized Kentucky battery facility. This factory was originally part of Ford’s $7 billion EV investment push in 2021, built in partnership with South Korea’s SK On. Today, one plant sits idle, and only a portion of the other is producing batteries. Now that part will make batteries for both Nissan and Ford..Partnering with Nissan will help absorb excess capacity.Nissan incurred a $4.5 billion loss in the last reported quarter and just scrapped plans for a battery plant in Japan. Local U.S. production will help reduce its tariff exposure, which is a strategic move by Nissan..Nissan’s peer Honda HMC is also rethinking its EV roadmap. As global demand cools, Honda is slashing its EV and software investment target by nearly a third and pivoting toward hybrids. Honda now plans to launch 13 new hybrid models globally by 2030, while scaling back expectations for fully electric vehicles..These moves underscore the challenges Ford and other automakers are facing as EV demand stalls and costs climb. Ford has suspended its full-year 2025 guidance, citing tariff-related uncertainties. The company incurred a $5.07 billion EV loss in 2024, and we expect another $5 billion at least in red ink this year..At this stage, investors may be wondering if the automaker still has a compelling long-term case. Let’s dig into the investment thesis..Ford is navigating through some tough terrain. One of the biggest hurdles is the impact of Trump tariffs, which are expected to cost the company a staggering $2.5 billion. While Ford plans to cushion the blow by offsetting $1 billion through various efficiency and cost-cutting measures, the remaining $1.5 billion hit in 2025 looms large. With potential retaliatory tariffs and ongoing supply chain disruptions, the road ahead remains unpredictable. On a broader scale, tariffs could slash U.S. auto industry sales by around 500,000 units, a drop that would undoubtedly weigh on Ford’s own sales and bottom line..The traditional Ford Blue division, which sells gas-powered vehicles, is also showing signs of fatigue. The company anticipates lower sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles this year compared to 2024 A shift in product mix, combined with foreign exchange headwinds, is expected to further compress profits.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fords-ev-retrenchment-deepens-buy-153700727.html,1.

This decision comes amid ongoing trade and tariff negotiations between the United States and China.GM had been exporting vehicles to China through its premium import brand, The Durant Guild, which accounted for less than 0.1% of its total sales in the country, per a company spokesperson. Due to major shifts in economic conditions, GM has decided to restructure the Durant Guild and streamline its operations in China. Previously, U.S.-made goods imported into China were subject to tariffs exceeding 100%, though these were temporarily reduced as part of a 90-day agreement between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2025, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 442,000 vehicles in China, marking year-over-year sales growth and the third straight quarter of increasing market share. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, jumped 53.2% compared to the same period last year. GM, which already offers the most extensive NEV lineup among global automakers in China, plans to expand its portfolio further in 2025 by introducing extended-range electric vehicles, ensuring at least one NEV option for every new locally launched model. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In April, GM’s rival, Ford Motor Company F, paused shipments of several U.S.-built vehicles, including the F-150 Raptor, Mustang, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator, to China due to retaliatory tariffs that pushed import taxes as high as 150%. Ford is considered one of the automakers most capable of handling tariffs, as roughly 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built domestically. However, Ford may still increase prices on new vehicles if tariff woes deepen.Last month, Tesla, Inc. TSLA also halted new orders for its Model S and Model X on its Chinese website after China increased tariffs on U.S. imports. New orders for both Tesla models were also no longer accessible through the automaker's WeChat mini program in China.

He has an array of tools if he decides to escalate further.,"President Trump has taken aim at at least four retailers over possible tariff price hikes with an effort that, for now at least, is largely about applying public pressure to CEOs..""I'll be watching,"" he told Walmart (WMT), with harsh words also directed toward Amazon (AMZN), Ford (F), and Mattel (MAT)..It's just one front in a largely one-way war of words between the president and corporate America in recent weeks over tariffs, with Trump also threatening new tariffs for both Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (005930.KS) Friday over overseas phone production..But it's the tariff-fueled price hikes already being felt by his base of voters that hit the closest to home for Trump politically as he drops hints that he could do more than just watch prices rises for consumers in the months ahead..Threats of additional tariffs in response to price increases have already been offered with an array of additional tools at the president's disposal if he decided to escalate further..Options range from things like industry-wide investigations by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), other government investigations into specific products and company profits, pushing for new Capitol Hill legislation on the issue, or even price controls via executive order..If some of those options sound familiar, that's because many of these tools were considered and even employed during Joe Biden's presidency as part of the then-Democratic charges of ""price gouging"" amid inflation. Formal inquiries were even launched in certain areas like meatpacking..Other options for Trump stretch back much further, notably a Richard Nixon-issued executive order in 1971 that imposed a 90-day freeze on wages and prices during that inflation crisis..Ryan Bourne, an economist at the Cato Institute, has studied the issue and says the US remains a long ways politically from something like those draconian Nixon-era policies..But he nevertheless sees a sort of bipartisan elevation in recent years in government willingness to interfere in business pricing decisions..""I do worry that we're on the conveyor belt towards that type of policy,"" he said of price controls in a recent interview..For now, he added, businesses are in an environment where CEOs ""increasingly have to second-guess how the president or the administration will react to them."".Trump has not suggested that price controls are in the offing.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter. .Automotive companies are accelerating AI adoption while battling headwinds from economic uncertainty driven by shifting U.S. trade policy. .The financial strain cannot be overstated, as General Motors projects up to $5 billion in tariff costs this year, Toyota Motor Corp. forecasts a net income decline of 21% amid levies and Ford Motor Co. expects tariffs to cost the company about $2.5 billion in gross profit this year.  .In the face of economic uncertainty, major carmakers are turning to AI, automation and strengthened data analytics capabilities to unlock efficiencies, save costs and help buoy the business..Ford COO Kumar Galhotra said the company is working with several partners on AI projects that will “save us substantial amounts of costs” during its Q1 2025 earnings call earlier this month. .The company is implementing AI within its product development system, which is already saving weeks worth of effort as part of the design process, Ford executives said. The carmaker is also experimenting with AI-powered robotics, such as its Boston Dynamics robot dog deployed in an assembly plant in Spain. .“It has sensors on it that can see, hear, feel vibrations, smell any leaks of oil,” Galhotra said. “It just literally walks around the plant all day long and has changed how we do our preventive maintenance because it can see and hear and look for errors well before a human being could.”.General Motors has relied on partners to beef up its AI capabilities, too. The company partnered with chipmaker Nvidia in March to accelerate the integration of AI-powered hardware and software in its vehicles. The partnership was announced just a few weeks after the automotive manufacturer appointed its first chief AI officer..“We have many other partnerships going on because we think we can leverage AI to make our business much more efficient and faster,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call earlier this month. “We just hired a new head of AI who's working across each area of the business, and each of my directs has a goal to demonstrate how they're leveraging AI to either improve the way we do business or the cost of how we do business.”.GM is using AI to bolster safety, improve quality and unlock efficiencies as well. The company implements digital twins to simulate a running production line to optimize planning processes and save time and money, according to a March blog post. Other use cases include pinpointing potential leaks in battery packs, inspecting welds and painting coats, and locating optimal locations to install electric vehicle chargers. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carmakers-rev-ai-efforts-amid-070000527.html,- Market Risk  - Technology Risk  - Competitive Risk

The committee will also explore alternative ways to compensate Musk for past work should Tesla fail to reinstate his record 2018 pay deal via an appeal at the Delaware Supreme Court this year, the report says..WORSE BEFORE BETTER: Morgan Stanley says investors “struggle to justify the value of Tesla as much as ever before” nearly 15 years after the company went public, adding that the firm expects this “valuation ‘problem’ gets worse before it gets better.” Most investors value Tesla’s core auto business at between $50 and $100 per share, then “they put their pens down,” but stopping there is “akin to valuing Amazon (AMZN) as solely an online retailer or Apple (AAPL) as a seller of glowing rectangles and earbuds,” the firm argues. By the mid-2030s, Morgan Stanley forecasts Tesla’s installed base to approach 50M units and estimates that each $100/month of ARPU generated by this installed base for autonomy, charging, connectivity, upgrades, content, used sales, parts/service, and licensing is worth $80 to $100 per share. The energy storage business is Tesla’s “fastest growing and highest margin hardware business at present,” adds that firm, which values Tesla Energy at $67 per share. While Morgan Stanley says it currently does not include a valuation for Tesla Optimus in either its base or bull case, it estimates that every 1% substitution by humanoid of human labor is worth greater than $300B, or around $100 per Tesla share. The firm has an Overweight rating and $410 price target on Tesla, adding that “the majority of the company’s current $1.1tn market cap is based on businesses that have either poor disclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charged-tesla-restart-shipping-chinese-151016276.html,Market Volatility:  - Company-specific risk: Tesla - Industry-specific risk: Electric Vehicle - Supply chain risk: Logistics and shipping
149,2025-05-20 20:14:00,General Motors Urges Lawmakers to Block EV Mandate as EV Demand Slows,GM urges lawmakers to block California's strict zero-emission vehicle mandate as demand for EVs plummets.,"General Motors Company GM is urging lawmakers to block California’s strict zero-emission vehicle mandate, signaling a significant reversal in the automaker’s stance as demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States begins to slow, per the Wall Street Journal.Per an internal email sent by GM to thousands of salaried employees last week, emissions regulations that are not aligned with market conditions threaten the company’s business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable.Once a supporter of California’s plan to phase out gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035, GM is now lobbying against it. The company is encouraging employees to contact Senators to revoke California’s waiver, which permits the state to enforce stricter emissions rules. These rules have been adopted by 11 other states. GM had previously aligned its EV strategy with California's goals, but declining EV demand and market pressures have prompted a strategic shift. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.California aims for 35% of all new vehicle sales to be electric or plug-in hybrid (PHEV) by 2026. However, in the first quarter, EVs accounted for 20.8% of sales and PHEVs 3.7%, totaling 24.5%, which is roughly 10 percentage points below the target and slightly down from the previous quarter.As EV sales fall short of projections, major automakers like GM and Ford Motor Company F are scaling back their EV initiatives. GM has abandoned its plan to produce 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and postponed several key launches as consumers prefer more affordable options and federal tax incentives face potential rollbacks.In the first four months of 2025, Ford’s EV sales declined 2.9% year over year to 27,409 units. Also, the company's Model e segment, which features all-electric models, continues to struggle amid stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024, exacerbated by ongoing pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. The company is expected to incur huge losses in its EV business this year as well. Another auto giant, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, is also struggling with falling demand for EVs. In the first quarter, Tesla deliveries fell 13% year over year to 336,681 units. Automotive margins are also on the decline amid falling volumes and generous discount offers. The metric came in at 11.3% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 15.5% reported in the corresponding quarter of 2024.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-urges-lawmakers-block-121400474.html,- Regulatory Risk - Industry Risk - Market Risk

It's not hard to see the potential reward for investors in high-yield stocks like Ford (NYSE: F) and UPS (NYSE: UPS).","Both stocks trade with huge dividend yields, but neither may prove sustainable..Ford's EV business is deeply unprofitable..UPS is on the right strategic track, but it may be being hamstrung by its dividend..10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›.Reward matters in investing, but so does risk. It's not hard to see the potential reward for investors in high-yield stocks like Ford (NYSE: F) and UPS (NYSE: UPS). Investors hope to profit from a 7.1% and 6.5% dividend yield, respectively, while waiting for the two companies to turn around their operating performance. Still, what about the risk of both companies cutting their dividends? Here's a look at which company is best positioned when considering reward and risk..The table below explains the problem well. UPS aims to pay out about 50% of its earnings in dividends, with Ford aiming for 40% to 50% of its free cash flow (FCF) in dividends. Focusing on FCF, it's clear that the initial guidance given by both companies in late January/early February didn't imply much cover for potential dividends in 2025..UPS plans to pay out $5.5 billion in dividends in 2025. Ford's situation is a bit more complicated, as it pays a regular dividend of $0.15 a quarter and a supplemental dividend of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The figure you see below is the total for 2024. These figures imply that Ford could use up to 89% of FCF on its dividend in 2025, with UPS using up 96%..Fast-forward to early April and the ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, and the trading and cost environment changed so dramatically that both companies declined to reaffirm or update their guidance. Moreover, UPS management spoke of worse-than-expected declines in average daily volumes (ADV) in February and March and said second-quarter ADV would decline by 9%..Ford suspended guidance due to potential supply chain challenges, tariff implementation changes, and other potential trade restrictions. In addition, Ford's outlook is challenged, as is UPS', by a decline in consumer confidence due to tariff uncertainty..The bottom line is that deteriorating trading conditions could force both companies to cut their dividends in 2025, and investors need to be aware of this..Free Cash Flow and Cash Dividends.Ford.UPS.Initial full-year guidance.$3.5 billion to $4.5 billion.$5.7 billion.Cash dividend paid in 2024.$3.1 billion.$5.4 billion*.Post-""Liberation Day"" full-year guidance.Guidance suspended.No update to guidance.Data source: Company presentations. *Management's guidance for cash dividends in 2025 is $5.5 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-dividend-stock-ups-vs-224100007.html,1.

Unless you have purposefully been hiding (which some could understand), you're aware of the back-and-forth whipsaw of tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, retaliatory tariffs. Sprinkled with a little tariff relief for autos and then a temporary truce with China for 90 days to further negotiate tariffs, it's been an interesting spring..Let's cover how much tariffs could cost some automakers, and which vehicles top the list of most American-made -- based on parts content, the workforce, and assembly sites-- and will thus face less impact..The situation can easily become confusing and is constantly being updated, but essentially there is a 25% tariff slapped on imported vehicles as well as a 25% tariff on imported automotive parts. Here's where it gets a little complicated, and why Cars.com's 2024 American-Made Index is so important: The Trump administration provided a little relief on auto parts tariffs by giving credits for what is produced in the U.S..As expected, these tariffs will have a significant impact on automakers' bottom lines. General Motors said the tariffs would cost it between $4 billion to $5 billion in annual profit, and rival Ford Motor Company expects a $1.5 billion annual hit..Toyota said it anticipates a $1.2 billion profit decline in only two months, while Honda expects its operating profit to drop nearly 60% in the current fiscal year after being hit with tariffs..With that backdrop, here's the list of most American-made vehicles, per Cars.com's index. The list gauges criteria that include assembly location, parts content, engine and transmission point of origin, and U.S. manufacturing workforce..Tesla Model Y.Honda Passport.Volkswagen ID.4.Tesla Model S.Honda Odyssey.Honda Ridgeline.Toyota Camry.Jeep Gladiator.Tesla Model X.Lexus TX.Here's another quick list, which we'll analyze in a second, based on the share of U.S. light-duty (passenger) vehicle sales from domestic assembly for the 2024 model year..Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 100%.Ford: 72.4%.Stellantis: 66.8%.Honda: 61.5%.Toyota: 53.6%.Subaru: 48.7%.General Motors: 47.6%.There are a few takeaways and perhaps questions to answer. You might wonder why Ford and GM didn't have any vehicles in the top 10 most American-made, yet Toyota expects to take the worst profit hit. That's because while Toyota has recently upped its U.S. production, it still has key imported vehicles and parts -- it imports roughly 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. annually.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amid-tariff-chaos-vehicles-most-221400276.html,1.

153,2025-05-17 22:00:00,This week in Trumponomics: Everyday higher prices,Big retailers confirm that price hikes caused by the Trump tariffs are coming this summer.,"In a move that should have surprised nobody, Walmart (WMT) said on May 15 that the Trump tariffs will force it to raise prices on many items, starting at the end of the month. Virtually all retailers will follow Walmart's lead, whether they announce it or not..The Trump tariffs are taxes on imports that directly raise the cost to US businesses and consumers. Trump falsely claims that foreign countries and businesses bear the cost of his tariffs. Americans will now see for themselves that it's not true as prices jump for thousands of everyday items..Trump has raised the average import tax on some $3 trillion worth of products from 2.5% to around 18%. China faces the biggest jump in tariffs, with a new 30% levy on most imports. Trump put a new 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum, and automobiles from most countries. Imports not covered by those taxes face a new 10% ""baseline"" tariff..Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs.Consumers haven't noticed tariff-induced price hikes yet because most of the stuff retailers are selling now comes from inventories built up before the tariffs went into effect. The inflation rate in April was just 2.3%, which is basically back to normal after a surge of inflation that got as high as 9% in 2022. If the Trump tariffs weren't raising prices, the inflation shock would be over..Alas, it's not..After Trump raised the tariff on Chinese imports to 145% on April 9, shipments from China basically stopped. Almost nobody was willing to pay that tax, especially since many importers figured Trump would relent at some point..Trump did relent, lowering the China tariff to 30% on May 12. There's a chance it could go lower if Chinese and US trade negotiators reach some kind of deal. But analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the tariff to remain around 30% for the rest of the year, and maybe for the duration of Trump's second term..Business leaders now seem to be reshaping their plans around the current tariff levels. While the 145% tariff on Chinese goods was prohibitively high, importers may have no choice but to resume purchases from China at the 30% tariff rate as pre-tariff inventories start to run out. And it's normal practice for businesses to pass on as much of the higher cost of tariffs as they can to their own customers..Trump has tried to pressure American importers into eating the cost of the tariffs and even keeping mum about their effects on business. After an April report said Amazon (AMZN) was considering a plan to show the added cost of tariffs on its website, Trump called executive chairman Jeff Bezos to complain.

The company just revealed plans for a new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery technology that could dramatically lower costs and boost the performance of its largest electric vehicles (EVs). If all goes according to plan, GM could become the first automaker to bring LMR prismatic battery cells to market — a move targeted for 2028..These new batteries are designed for GM’s full-size electric trucks and SUVs like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR chemistry swaps out pricey materials like nickel and cobalt for more common and affordable manganese. This shift not only cuts raw material costs but could also help GM improve the range and weight efficiency of its EVs..GM claims that LMR batteries offer 33% higher energy density than today’s top lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, all while maintaining comparable costs. This means more miles per charge without driving up sticker prices..Production is already on the horizon. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution, aims to begin preproduction in late 2027 and full commercial production in 2028. It’s all part of GM’s broader push to scale its Ultium platform and improve EV profitability..But GM isn’t the only auto giant chasing this battery breakthrough. Ford F is also in the race, and it's moving fast. Last month, the company announced that it is developing its own LMR battery chemistry at its Ion Park R&D center in Michigan. Ford has already begun pilot production of second-generation cells and aims to roll out LMR-powered EVs before the decade ends..Ford sees LMR as the “what’s next” solution following its current use of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and LFP batteries. The company believes the chemistry could unlock longer-range, lower-cost EVs, especially crucial for scaling up mass-market adoption..Tesla TSLA, meanwhile, planted early seeds in this space. CEO Elon Musk floated the idea of high-manganese batteries as far back as 2020 during Tesla’s “Battery Day.” At the time, he said Tesla aimed to create cathodes with one-third manganese content to stretch its nickel supply further. Tesla holds patents related to LMR chemistry, but it is yet to share firm production plans..GM looks set to be the first to market with LMR batteries, Ford is close behind, while Tesla's earlier concepts still await a clear update..Shares of General Motors have lost around 6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 13%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gms-lmr-battery-could-change-125100497.html,Commodity Risk Industiral Risk Regulatory Risk Environmental Risk Operational Risk

The issue stems from the front brake lines possibly coming into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, which could damage the lines and cause a fluid leak. A brake fluid leak may lead to longer brake pedal travel and a reduction in the rate of deceleration. A sudden loss or complete depletion of brake fluid can increase the distance needed to bring the vehicle to a stop, increasing the likelihood of a collision. The problem may have originated from the front brake line being bent during installation.The affected vehicles were produced between April 15, 2021, and Nov. 20, 2024. Only about 1% of the recalled SUVs are expected to have this issue and haven’t led to any crashes or injuries. Owners of recalled vehicles are advised to bring their SUVs to a Ford or Lincoln dealership for inspection. If needed, the front brake line and/or air cleaner outlet pipe will be replaced at no cost to the customer.The Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator have been key models in Ford’s lineup since their introduction in the late 1990s. Last year, Ford sold more than 78,000 Expeditions and 15,000 Navigators in the United States. F carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

Including those not named Tesla..Consumer research group J.D. Power's latest EV consideration study found that 24% of car shoppers said they are ""very likely"" to consider purchasing an EV, and 35% said they are ""somewhat likely,"" which is largely unchanged from a year ago..J.D. Power polled 8,164 consumers in January through April who intend to buy or lease a new vehicle in the next 12 months..""Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” J.D. Power executive director of EV practice Brent Gruber said in a statement..Interestingly, with more options available, consumers are shopping across brands. Buyers are cross-shopping on average 2.9 brands when looking at EVs, versus two brands seen with gas-powered cars..And they are increasingly looking at EVs other than Tesla. J.D. Power found that the top five vehicle brands cross-shopped among purchasers interested in the Model Y SUV are Honda, Ford, BMW, Toyota, and Cadillac, in that order..""Manufacturers that didn't have electric vehicles before have now rounded out their portfolios with EV products, and so consumers are considering products from those other brands,"" Gruber said in an interview with Yahoo Finance..Honda's popular Prologue EV, Ford's Mustang Mach-E, and BMW products like the iX, i4, and i5 are gaining traction. Cadillac's Lyriq has been GM's top-selling EV for some time now..Read more: How your vehicle's make and model affect car insurance costs.Gruber added that Tesla brand issues may be behind the cross-shopping..""There's certainly some consumer sentiment for and against some of the actions taken by Elon Musk in the political arena,"" Gruber said. ""So we have seen some impact from that."".But Gruber believes Tesla sales have been affected by the availability of new products coming to market, like the Prologue and Lyriq, rather than perceived brand issues..The broader EV market, however, faces a big headwind: the potential loss of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. House Republicans are pushing a bill that would end the EV tax credit, a signature component of former President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act..Not surprisingly, Gruber believes this would create a major impact on EV sales..""You're potentially looking at a double whammy with tariffs and the elimination of the tax credit,"" Gruber said. ""You're talking about what is conceivably a $12,000-plus swing on the price of an electric vehicle. So if those tax credits go away, you're going to see probably a slowdown in the level of interest for electric vehicles.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jd-power-car-buyers-are-still-interested-in-evs-and-tesla-alternatives-144540737.html,Market Risk  Operational Risk  Environmental Risk

Ford's growth and profitability are disappointing, and the business likely has no economic moat.  Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) recently reported financial results for the first quarter of 2025.","Ford beat Wall Street revenue and earnings estimates in Q1, helping the stock outperform the S&P 500 so far this year..Investors might be drawn to the cheap valuation and the high dividend yield..Ford's growth and profitability are disappointing, and the business likely has no economic moat..10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›.Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) recently reported financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Automotive revenue of $37.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.14 both came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. However, trade uncertainties caused the leadership team to pull guidance for the full year..The market doesn't seem deterred. While the S&P 500 index is flat this year, shares of Ford are up 7% (as of May 13). Perhaps this could be the early indication of a strong run over the next few years..Can this automotive stock double between now and 2030?.If a stock doubles over a five-year period, it means that investors achieve a 15% annualized total return. This is a fantastic outcome..One variable that could drive returns is the dividend, which currently yields 7.03%. This is a sizable payout for investors. In the last 12 months, 60% of Ford's net income went to paying the dividend, so there might be minimal opportunity to increase this. The negative view is that if there is a recession, the company's profitability could take a hit, which will impact the dividend..Ford shareholders have two other factors that must work in their favor as well. One is the potential for higher EPS. If a business is able to grow its bottom line over time, it usually bodes well for the stock..Another powerful variable is valuation. As of this writing, Ford stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.5. This represents a sizable 63% discount to the overall S&P 500. If shares somehow got to their past five-year average P/E multiple of 11.1 by 2030, it would introduce 30% upside for investors..Some investors might find Ford shares an opportunity that's too difficult to pass up right now. However, it's easy to find many traits that point to this being a low-quality business that long-term investors looking to compound capital should avoid at all costs. .Let's look at Ford's track record. In the past 10 years, shares have generated a total return of just 17%. The S&P 500 significantly outperformed the automaker, as investors in the widely followed index would've more than tripled their starting capital.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-double-2030-131000301.html,Investment Risk - Market Risk - Business Risk - Financial Risk

Ford suffered chronic losses while GM was basking in bountiful gains..Quickly and easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks straight to you inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.The auto industry is known for its high cyclicality and capital-intensive nature, requiring companies to effectively navigate macroeconomic fluctuations. Ultimately, those consistently converting capital into earnings tend to come out on top..To determine the better investment, this analysis examines both companies more closely from the perspectives of capital efficiency and current valuations, leading to a bullish outlook on GM and a neutral stance on Ford..Several vital factors merit consideration when evaluating whether Ford or General Motors presents a more compelling valuation and stronger return on capital, particularly within the inherently cyclical automotive industry..The automotive sector is highly capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment in manufacturing infrastructure, research and development, and distribution networks. As a result, the efficiency with which companies allocate and utilize capital is a critical measure of performance..Consider Ford as an example. In 2024, the company reported an operating profit of $5.2 billion, largely unchanged from the $5.3 billion it earned in 2023. Over the same period, its invested capital—which includes net tangible assets and working capital—declined modestly to $60.5 billion from $63.6 billion. Based on these figures, Ford achieved a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 8.6% in 2024, consistent with the 8.5% it posted the previous year..Taking a broader view, Ford’s performance has demonstrated notable volatility in recent years. For instance, the company reported a $4.1 billion operating loss in 2020 amid the pandemic, followed by a strong recovery, reaching $8 billion in operating profit by 2022. Over the past five years, this translates to an average return on invested capital (ROIC) of approximately 7%. Excluding the impact of 2020, that figure improves to a range of 8.5% to 13%. Nonetheless, the data reflect a pattern of inconsistency in capital returns..In contrast, General Motors has shown more robust and stable growth. In 2024, GM reported a substantial increase in operating profit, reaching $12.7 billion, up significantly from $9.6 billion in 2023. Its invested capital also rose to $65.1 billion from $58.4 billion, driven primarily by increased working capital. Notably, reducing inventories suggests improved operational efficiency, as GM effectively converted excess stock into stronger sales and higher operating margins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-auto-stocks-general-motors-124504349.html,"Operational Risk, Industry Risk, Capital Market Risk"

Chief EV, Digital and Design Officer Doug Field shared an update of the company’s future strategy as the automaker navigates the auto industry’s transition to software-defined vehicles, in a May 2 blog post. .Ford’s future-state software project, code-named “FNV4,” will combine with its existing vehicle architecture dubbed “FNV3” into a new version referred to as “FNV3.X.” Field said Ford plans to build on its FNV3.X architecture and offer it across a full portfolio of vehicles..“In today’s automobiles, software is the single biggest lever in advancing a customer’s ownership experience,” Field said in the blog post. .Field said Ford is already far ahead of its competitors in deploying vehicle software updates. The company delivered 9.5 million updates to its fleet in the first quarter of 2025, according to its blog post, and the shift to its FNV3.X vehicle architecture will deliver software innovations even more quickly to customers..The new architecture will facilitate the rollout of new digital services to customers and improve vehicle quality. It will also support advanced vehicle security and deliver driving and infotainment enhancements to more Ford customers, according to Field. .In addition to improving the customer experience, the FNV3.X architecture will allow the automaker to extend the current digital experience — currently offered in the Explorer, Lincoln Nautilus and Navigator — to other vehicles, including the Bronco, F-150, Mustang and Ranger. This approach will also enable Ford to more easily add its BlueCruise hands-free driving technology to additional models that otherwise wouldn’t support it, as the required architecture will be preinstalled..“Whether it’s hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise, intelligent navigation, using your phone as a key, or our Ford Security Package to give you peace of mind, we’re integrating technology that actually makes life better, and doing it across as many of our vehicles as we can,” Field said in the blog post..Unified software across the portfolio.Like other automakers, Ford is migrating from traditional vehicle architectures to electrical-electronic systems powered by software that can be regularly updated over-the-air. .Field said software should be available across Ford’s lineup to reach as many customers as possible. Having a dedicated electrical architecture reserved for some vehicles and a legacy architecture for other models — while simultaneously trying to keep them all updated — is not a good strategy for Ford, according to the blog. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-chief-ev-digital-design-093800079.html,Market Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against other best high volume stocks..On May 9, BMO private wealth chief market strategist Carol Schleif joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy. Reflecting on a market decline in April that reached a ~20% drop, Schleif noted that the market recovered and ended only 3% to 4 % down. She described investor reactions during that period as mixed: about 10% were very eager to buy, but another 10% were quite nervous, while the majority remained measured. She emphasized the important distinction between markets and the economy and noted that markets often move ahead of economic realities and quickly shift focus to new topics as part of their discounting mechanism. This is why markets serve as economic indicators and anticipate future developments..She talked about how individual risk tolerance varies, with some younger clients adopting conservative strategies and some older clients favoring aggressive positions, especially in tech. Schleif acknowledged that tariffs are expected to rise from under 3% to ~10%, but despite this anticipation, she’s confident that markets and companies will adjust to the changes. She noted the unusual shift in US influence, which now extends beyond material control to more intangible domains, and described this shift in responsibility as significant and complex. Schleif also emphasized the value of globally diversified portfolios, which have been challenging to maintain during periods when the US market outperformed. However, she noted that such diversification, which includes fixed income and foreign equities, has provided better performance and protection year-to-date and helps investors weather volatility better than those concentrated solely in US assets..We first used stock screeners to compile a list of stocks with high average 3-month volumes. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024..Note: All data was collected on May 12..Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Prices are down half a percent in April, but still were up 1 and a half percent from a year ago. Meanwhile, new vehicle prices, they were flat last month, but rose slightly on a year-over-year basis. Here with more we've got Greg Migliore, who is the editorial director at AutoGuide. Greg, just take us into your reaction from the print first and then we'll get into some of the other, uh, of course, major drivers of what's taking place broadly here within the mindset of consumers. .Sure, Brad. Well, thanks for having me. Good to see you. I mean, right now, the car business is still trying to sort out the impact of the tariffs, and I think that was evident in the better than expected CPI numbers and some other numbers you mentioned. We haven't seen a dramatic immediate effect on pricing due to tariffs. Uh, I think there just really wasn't enough time to feel the impact. But we are seeing these tariffs hit in other ways. So we're starting to see fallout as companies like Honda and Nissan are expected to report lower profits. Uh, Ford even specifically called out that its tariff hit is going to be $1.5 billion this year. So, uh, I think we're in kind of a wait-and-see mode right now as far as some of these immediate impacts for consumers. .And so, what is the overall kind of sentiment that we're seeing among consumers who are both hearing from car brands that they are, you know, putting vehicles out on the lot, the non-tariff vehicles on the lot, and then additionally, how consumers are just trying to make sure that they aren't seeing a higher price when they know that from a range of countries and how vehicles are produced in in essence that there could be some pass-through costs that they may incur one day and trying to front run that instead. .Well, I think it's actually pretty confusing for consumers right now. You're thinking yourself, hey, should I rush to the dealership and try to get something before the car I want is actually impacted by tariffs? Should I wait? Are the tariffs going to actually happen this week or this month? So, it's definitely a confusing situation. That being said, it's actually been a pretty good year for car buying. The seasonally adjusted selling rate was over 17 million by a lot of metrics the last couple months, which is a very strong performance for the US auto industry. Uh, you are seeing some companies like Stellantis, for example, offering employee pricing, which is where they, you know, try to make it basically a cheaper, you know, one-cost sort of price, and companies are getting aggressive, which I do think that could benefit consumers. The auto industry is used to operating on a very low margin circumstances for many of their products. They're used to this increased competitiveness. They're used to macroeconomic headwinds. It's all sort of par for the course for the car business. So, in some ways, I think the car world is uniquely positioned to deal with these headwinds. .And so, with that in mind, what about on the used vehicle side? I mean, we we've even heard the strategy from companies that are in the rental space, but also have a used vehicle sales arm, like Hertz. And within their own, uh, within their own recent announcements, talking about a company's cornerstone cell-right strategy, trying to maximize value, improve unit economics, and ultimately leaning into how they can communicate their own value proposition amid some of the tariff-driven pricing dynamics that they're seeing with used car prices rising and and what they essentially label as DPU declining here. How what does that ultimately mean, especially as you hear companies like Hertz talking about their best quarter for retail vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025? And where that's moving consumers to? .Well, I think when you're trying to get yourself a deal, you think used car, right? It's just a natural sort of consumer reaction to price hikes that we think will impact the new car market. Uh, I think it's a frustrating time for consumers on the used car front because you're seeing prices basically higher than ever. I saw a figure that said they were $28,000, that was the average price of a used vehicle, uh, earlier this year, which to me is kind of it's almost an astronomical figure. You wouldn't expect to pay that much money for a used car even if it were something more in the premium space. So again, I think it's a frustrating time for consumers. Uh, but for companies, you know, that do have large fleets that they're trying to offload, I do see great opportunity. You have a chance to get in there, perhaps, you know, cycle through some vehicles you might like to, you know, offload from your general rental fleet or whatnot, uh, move the metal, and make a little bit of money. So I think for companies like Hertz, it's a great time to, you know, frankly, make some money and try to even reach new consumers, remind people that you're out there. And it's it's like many things in this economy. It's not really good for everybody, but for certain segments of it, you know, there's really some spotlight opportunity. .So, how is that influencing the summer outlook then for car buying? .So, I think this summer is going to actually be a decent time to buy a car. I think the summer buying season for the car industry, you get into like Memorial Day, then right through Labor Day. People are going to dealerships. That's usually a time, it's nice out. People are interested in into getting something new and setting themselves up for, you know, the rest of the year, school year, you know, the winter. It's human nature, right? So, generally you see decent foot traffic and companies are pretty aggressive. Uh, I saw that the average, um, you know, incentive was over $3,000 last month, which is actually a pretty hefty amount of cash on the hood for vehicles. Credit is still reasonably available. It's not quite as good as it was, but for most people, it's out there. You could use it to finance your new vehicle purchase. We're seeing longer and longer car loans in excess of 72 months because people know that, hey, you can maybe spread out that payment over time. Is that the best financial decision? Probably not, but it helps you get into a new vehicle. So, I actually think this summer is going to be a decent time to buy a car. .All right, Greg. We're going to be watching closely. Maybe I'll go kick the tires somewhere, maybe. Appreciate the time. .Thank you.

Honda will also assemble the upcoming Civic, set for a 2028 launch, in the US instead of Mexico, Reuters reported..Honda's projection of a steep hit to its bottom line from Trump's tariffs on foreign autos and auto parts is the latest disclosure from a major automaker..Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet.Auto sector tariffs are taking a hatchet to automaker profits.

But inventory at dealerships may have shielded car buyers from tariff price hikes, at least for now.","The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report revealed new car prices were flat, a surprise as many felt President Trump’s auto sector tariffs would boost prices. But inventory at dealerships may have shielded car buyers from tariff price hikes, at least for now..In April, new vehicle prices came in at no change from the previous month and up 0.3% year over year. Used vehicle prices were down 0.5%, and up 1.5% from a year ago..The report comes on the heels of Trump’s 25% foreign-made auto tariffs that began on April 3, affecting not only European and Asian manufacturers but also Big Three automakers GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), which import vehicles from Canada and Mexico, as well as a few models from China..The expectation was for new vehicle prices to climb higher, reflecting the passing of tariff costs on to consumers, as well as a concurrent hike in used vehicle prices as buyers shifted to preowned vehicles..Read more: April inflation breakdown: Food, shelter, and medical care pinch consumers' wallets.A big reason price hikes were minimized could have been dealers and automakers eating into their preexisting new car inventory, which includes imports that were not tariffed. Dealers were not shy about promoting tariff-free inventory to buyers as a sales tactic in the competitive new car sales landscape..Not surprisingly, the number of cars on the lot is shrinking..Vehicle data and buying site CarPro reports that overall industry stock in April dropped to 2.6 million vehicles from around 3 million, with days of supply falling to just over 60..The average is around 70 days of supply, CarPro said, with different manufacturers maintaining different levels. For instance, Toyota (TM) has around 10 to 15 days of supply, whereas GM maintains around 50 to 60 days. Stellantis, during its troubled summer of 2024, had over 100 days' supply in the US, though that has come down substantially..Meanwhile, Hyundai (up 19%), Honda (up 17%), Ford (up 15%), and Toyota (up 8%) saw huge sales gains in April. (Note: GM and Stellantis do not report monthly sales.).Another reason why prices may have stayed unchanged is that several automakers, including Hyundai, guaranteed pricing through the end of May, CarPro said. The firm also said shipments will soon be tariff-exposed, and further supply and pricing pressures are expected in the weeks ahead..The question is how long the automakers can hold the line on prices..“Across OEMs, we continue to monitor post-tariff reactions, with GM saying that it will not raise prices across the board but continue to see consistent pricing (up 0.5%-1.0% for the year), and Ford extending employee pricing on most vehicles until July 4 (vs. June 2 previously) while hiking prices on Mexico-built vehicles,” Deutsche Bank’s Edison Yu wrote in a note Tuesday morning.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/car-dealers-shield-buyers-from-tariff-price-hikes-in-april-162713408.html,Market Risk

The American automotive stalwart is pushing into electric vehicles, but it has failed to make the segment profitable in the face of rising costs, upcoming tariffs, and major competition from pure-play electric vehicle manufacturers and other global brands..At a market cap of $41 billion, I think Ford Motor is in for a tough ride over the next decade as it faces increasing competition globally amid the transition to electric vehicles. Here are two stocks of varying size and risk I think can be larger than Ford Motor 10 years from now..First up is a company with a much smaller market cap than Ford today: Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB). This space flight upstart has a market cap of $9.5 billion, but I think it has a chance to head much higher in the next 10 years for patient investors..The company will generate around $500 million in revenue this year, which is a tiny figure compared to Ford's revenue of over $100 billion. However, smart investors know it is about the future, not the past. Rocket Lab's revenue is up 680% since the company went public in 2021, an impressive feat that makes it one of the fastest-growing businesses in the world..The company operates the small Electron rocket, which is one of the only rockets outside of SpaceX to reliably launch products for commercial customers. It has launched five times already in 2025 and is consistently booking new contracts from customers that enjoy the reliability and frequency of Electron launches. The Space Systems segment, where Rocket Lab builds and sells products like satellites and solar arrays to customers, generates the rest of the revenue. This vertical integration has helped Rocket Lab win contracts over the competition..Over the long term, Rocket Lab plans to begin launching its larger Neutron rocket and add-on software and services products to sell to customers. The Neutron rocket will have a much larger payload than the Electron, which means much more revenue potential. All in all, Rocket Lab has a huge opportunity to keep growing and capture more share in the space economy, which is expected to grow into a $1 trillion industry in the near future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-worth-more-110500347.html,High Risk  High Risk  No Risk

Although the auto sector was excluded from the deal, optimism still remains. Joining us now, senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian. So, what changes is it? Does anything change for the auto makers as a result of this? .Nothing's changed. It's all about optimism. Uh Dan Ives telling me that he, they hope that autos are next on the docket for any type of deal. Uh so currently we still have the 100% plus EV China EV tariffs are still in place right now. Uh you also have 25% parts and part and auto tariffs. So that nothing's changed but there's optimism growing that that will potentially be next for Trump and the team. But I mean, that's still a big if, right? And he hasn't mentioned anything about changing sector tariffs for autos at this moment. Uh and we hear, we heard about just this quarter how bad it could be, right? 4 to 5 billion for GM, 1.5 billion for Ford in terms of EBIT full year EBIT hits. And Toyota alone 1.3 billion in the last two months. So .Was it? Was Toyota the worst by the way? Is that? .Yeah, for April and May, they anticipated a 1.3 billion dollar hit to operating profits. So that's like giving us an idea of how bad it could be for them. So a a a deal with Japan could be a big deal for for the for U.S. because more likely than a deal with China for for sector autos. .And and just to be, so just to be clear, the 145% that was imposed the blanket tariff on China, that was not the tariff on auto parts. That was always just the 25%, correct? So it already wasn't the sort of that highest tariff that was out there. .Right. They had sort of hived off all the auto stuff to its own separate sort of sector tariff exactly 100%. .And a company like Tesla, the cars that sells in China makes in China. Yes. Right? So it doesn't really materially affect it. It's more about vibes I guess. .Yeah, but also there's parts that that they there are some parts that come from China that they use that they can't replicate here. So that's part of. But you're absolutely it's more about optimism and these vibes. It's what's coming up next. I think that's sort of why everyone's bidding up the auto makers right now.

196,2025-05-09 21:47:00,Slate CEO: We've raised nearly $700M from backers like Bezos for US-built EVs,EV startup Slate announced the company isn’t done raising funds.,"Electric vehicle startup Slate announced that the company isn’t done raising funds. Slate, which counts backers like Jeff Bezos and Guggenheim's Mark Walter as investors, has closed out its Series A and Series B funding and is now looking at a Series C. Prior to Thursday’s announcement, the company had reportedly raised around $110 million..“We've gone through a couple rounds of funding,” Slate CEO Chris Barman said to Yahoo Finance. “So Jeff Bezos was our lead in our first round, the Walter Group in our second round. We also have General Catalyst as an investor. And we've raised nearly $700 million.”.That whopping figure hadn't been reported before. But when it comes to building an auto business from scratch, it's possible billions will be needed..But with no stamping operation needed (the company will use pre-fabricated composite parts for the body) nor a paint shop (all the composite parts are already slate gray), Barman believes it can accomplish its goals with less capital..The company announced it would house its assembly facility at the former LSC Communications printing plant in Warsaw, Ind., and aims to reach its 150,000-unit run rate by late 2027. Slate has said cars will be on the road starting in late 2026..Slate said it will be cash flow positive shortly after production, a tough ask when competitors like Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are barely gross profit positive..Building in America means tariffs won’t be an issue, and the company believes it can keep its supply chain in the US as well..“We were very focused through the process that we wanted to also source American parts,” Barman said. “So we have a high number of US-sourced parts within the vehicle, so we'll be very insulated against that.”.Slate said previously that its EV pickup, a bare-bones truck with a footprint smaller than a Ford (F) Maverick, will cost somewhere in the mid-$20,000 range and will come in only one color, slate gray..The EV offers two options on the choice of two battery sizes for the rear-wheel-drive truck: a 52.7-kWh battery pack targeting 150 miles of range and an 84.3-kWh pack with 240 miles of range..Slate’s other appeal is to DIYers, who can add a massive number of custom parts, vinyl skins, and even a roof to make it an SUV and install them on their own..Buyers can also choose to do none of these things and have a cheap, utilitarian pickup..Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

He also warned them to not treat investing the same way as gambling and to not chase hype:.“So here’s the bottom line: You want to get started, go small, invest [in] what you know, research intensely, just research, research, research… It’s as simple as a keystroke and the information’s free, including up-to-the-minute financials, analyst presentations, brokerage research, and of course, the conference calls that I tell you are a must if you want to actually know what you’re doing. Simple? No. Lucrative? You bet it is.”.For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during Mad Money episodes that aired on the 5th and 6th of May 2024.
