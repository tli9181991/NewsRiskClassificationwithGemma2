It's the third round of cuts since the start of 2024.","Rivian has laid off around 140 employees, or roughly 1% of its workforce, as it prepares for the launch of its more affordable R2 SUV in 2026, TechCrunch has learned..The cuts were mostly made to Rivian’s manufacturing team and have been ongoing since Wednesday, according to multiple former employees who were granted anonymity to speak about the layoffs. Some employees were told that the company was eliminating roles that created “process inefficiencies.”.Rivian confirmed the cuts in an email to TechCrunch. “We have made the difficult decision to reduce a small number of our salaried manufacturing employees as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,” a spokesperson wrote. The company said affected employees are being encouraged to apply to other open positions inside the company..Rivian began the year with more than 14,800 workers in North America and Europe, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has made multiple cuts over the last few years, including a 10% reduction in early 2024, and another layoff of around 1% of staff in April 2024.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-cuts-dozens-manufacturing-team-165829911.html,1.

2,2025-06-25 21:57:00,Can Rivian Weather Falling Deliveries Amid Demand Uncertainty?,RIVN slashes 2025 delivery outlook amid high uncertainty around consumer demand for high-priced vehicles.,"Rivian RIVN delivered 8,640 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, down from the 13,588 units delivered during the same period in the previous year. This drop was primarily attributed to higher-than-usual deliveries of Electric Delivery Vans (“EDV”) in the fourth quarter of 2024, which led to reduced volumes in the first quarter of 2025.The automaker produced 14,611 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, IL, in the first quarter, up from 13,980 vehicles produced in the same period last year. The company built more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter to make up for lost production later this year, since the factory will shut down for about a month to prepare for the R2 production. Most of these extra vehicles are not affected by tariffs, so the company plans to sell them in the coming quarters.Despite having sufficient in-hand inventory, Rivian's future deliveries are likely to be impacted by several external factors, including shifting government policies, macroeconomic conditions and trade-related supply-chain challenges. Elevated uncertainty around consumer sentiment, particularly regarding demand for high-priced vehicles, also clouds Rivian’s outlook. With an average selling price of $88,500 across its R1 models and commercial vans in the first quarter, Rivian’s premium product positioning inherently limits the addressable market, especially in the current economic climate. As a result of these challenges, Rivian revised its 2025 delivery guidance downward to a range of 40,000-46,000 vehicles compared with the earlier forecast of 46,000 to 51,000..In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla TSLA delivered 336,681 vehicles, comprising 323,800 Model 3/Y units and 12,881 from other models. Deliveries declined from 386,810 units reported in the year-ago quarter due to production pauses for Model Y retooling. Tesla plans to begin delivering the Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck in Saudi Arabia later this year, which will be the Cybertruck’s first launch outside North America.Lucid LCID delivered 3,109 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a rise of 58.1% compared with the same period in 2024. In April, Lucid introduced the Lucid Gravity, a full-size three-row SUV designed to combine practicality with high-end sophistication. The 2026 Lucid Gravity Grand Touring variant is priced starting at $94,900 and currently available for order. The Lucid Gravity Touring version, with a starting price of $79,900, is scheduled for release later in 2025.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-weather-falling-deliveries-amid-135700022.html,Operational Risk Supply Chain Risk Market Risk

Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), meanwhile, hasn't received a lot of press recently, but when you look under the hood, there are several major reasons to get excited..There's one catalyst that few investors are paying attention to right now that could add huge fuel to the stock price in early 2026. That makes now the time to buy for investors looking to stay ahead of the curve..When it comes to sales growth, it's been a tough couple of years for Rivian. The company's sales base today isn't much higher than it was at the end of 2023 due to several factors..Sales of electric vehicles industrywide has been below expectations, and weak consumer confidence has keep interest muted for the company's two luxury vehicles -- the R1T and R1S -- both of which can cost upwards of $100,000, depending on options. Those vehicles were also first released in 2021, adding staleness to the company's vehicle lineup..Fortunately, a big change is expected in 2026. This year, analysts predict annual sales growth of just 5.3%. In 2026, however, sales growth is expected to pick up to 40.5%..What's the cause? One factor: The release of new, affordable models..After years of development, Rivian is expected to begin releasing the first of three new models next year. The R2 will come first, with an expected price of under $50,000. The R3 is expected to follow as an even cheaper model..The R3X, meanwhile, is a high-performance version of the R3. While its details are unknown, the starting price is also expected to be below the $50,000 mark. That's critical, considering a majority of prospective electric-vehicle (EV) buyers are looking to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase..Without these newer, more affordable models, Rivian wouldn't be a viable option. The two vehicles currently in its lineup are simply too expensive..However, with the company's fresher lineup and more affordable options, analysts are very bullish on sales growth next year. But there's another surprising factor that should positively impact Rivian's financials even before these vehicles hit the road..In recent quarters, Rivian has attained positive gross margins for the first time in company history.

One of the best-positioned in the domestic market at this time is Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN). Let's consider which stock has a better chance of outperforming the other in the coming years..When it comes to the EV market, Tesla has not been fairing well lately. While some of this can be attributed to increased competition in the pure EV space and the rising popularity of hybrid vehicles, much of Tesla's recent sales slump can be laid directly at the feet of CEO Elon Musk. His foray into politics as a major donor to President Donald Trump's campaign and his leadership role at the head of Trump's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) angered many liberals, leading to protests and boycotts of Tesla vehicles. More recently, he got into a major spat with Trump that may have alienated him from consumers on the other side of the political spectrum as well..Right now, the most recent publicly available Tesla sales data is from April, which was before Musk's fight with Trump. The company's sales sank by 16% in the U.S. and plunged by 50% in Europe. Meanwhile, its sales in China dropped by 9%, even as the company offered bigger incentives and discounts in the country than it had in the past and introduced its Model Y vehicle in that market..With Tesla sales reeling in all of its primary markets, it is pinning its hopes on its robotaxi business. The company just launched the service for paying riders in Austin, Texas. It's a small pilot program so far -- the rides are only taking place within a geofenced area, use of the service is by invitation only, and the vehicles -- all of the Model Ys, not CyberCabs -- are operating for now with a safety monitor in the passenger seat..Footage has already surfaced of one of those robotaxis driving briefly in a lane designated for traffic going in the opposite direction, among other reports of them violating traffic laws, so questions remain about Tesla's autonomous driving technology. Additionally, there is still the issue of whether the brand damage that Musk has caused will lead to potential customers shunning his robotaxi business, as well.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-rivian-vs-084000735.html,1.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Automotive Dive newsletter. .NOVI, MICHIGAN — A chaotic global business environment fueled by tariffs between the U.S. and its major trading partners has inspired a quick-thinking mindset among automakers, according to representatives from Rivian and Toyota Motor North America..During a panel discussion at AutoTech2025, Chris Nevers, senior director of global policy development for Rivian, stressed the importance of being nimble as long as trade policies remain in flux. He said it's important to be ready to respond but also not overreact and stay on course as much as possible..“You know your North Star, and you have to know what you can either be flexible on or need to be flexible on,” he said..For Toyota, the automaker has streamlined its coordination and communication process companywide, said Adam Farris, director for international trade and supply chains for Toyota Motor North America..“Our ability to more quickly share that information with the right people within our company and with our stakeholders in different equities, get feedback, analyses, has really quickened,” Farris said. It has become a necessity as tariffs “are certainly a cost to our industry,” he added..While also dealing with U.S. tariffs on imports, automakers must also cope with duties placed on U.S.-built products destined elsewhere in the world. In Rivian’s case, Nevers said the EV manufacturer still plans to build delivery vans in the U.S. for use in Europe by Amazon despite the duty that will be charged on those vehicles. Market demand is driving that decision..“We export vans to Germany with Amazon,” he said. Nevers later added that ""if you want to dominate the energy scene, it’s not just burning more energy, it’s being smart about it.”.The recent wave of tariffs has led to automakers spending more time meeting with lawmakers, educating them on the implications of changing trade policies. Farris said Toyota has had numerous meetings in recent months with the White House and members of Congress..But Toyota isn’t alone, Farris noted. “I live in D.C., and I’ll tell you this, I don’t have to look for a hotel room, but the streets are getting crowded.”.A priority for Toyota is preserving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The automaker manufactured 123,456 Tacoma pickup trucks in Mexico between January and July last year, of which 113,611 were shipped to the U.S. in that same period, according to The Mexican Association of the Automotive Industry A.C.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexibility-key-tariff-turmoil-toyota-081900234.html,Market Risk

They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time..Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Rivian Automotive basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price..The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock..For Rivian Automotive, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher..As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions..The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the next 12 to 24 months, the company will experience several major growth catalysts. But as Warren Buffett often advises, keeping an eye on the long term is key to generating the biggest profits..Where might Rivian end up 10 years from now? The answer might surprise you..To understand where Rivian is headed over the next 10 years, we must first look at some near-term factors. That's because Rivian's near-term growth catalysts should help set the company up for the next decade of growth..When it comes to electric vehicle (EV) stocks, one of the most exciting catalysts involves getting new models to market that the masses can afford. Roughly 70% of Americans want their next car to cost less than $50,000. Getting vehicles to market with starting prices under this threshold is critical to putting growth on overdrive..But this is a challenge for most EV makers. On average, electric vehicles still cost more to build than conventional ones, and many EV start-ups lack the scale to sell vehicles at low prices. Plus, they often lack the capital runway to take a big financial hit by pricing vehicles that cost a lot to manufacture at a steep discount for consumers..After years of investment, Rivian is finally poised to release its first ""mass market"" vehicles. The R2, R3, and R3X are all expected to debut with starting prices under $50,000. The first of these three should start production in early 2026, though I don't expect full production of all three to commence until 2027 at the earliest..Still, these vehicles have the potential to revolutionize Rivian's business, changing it from a niche EV producer to a nationally recognized brand. Mass market vehicles like these can finally give Rivian the scale it needs to survive long term..Right now, Tesla's two mass market vehicles -- the Model Y and Model 3 -- contribute more than 90% of its vehicle sales. They are critical for the company's profitability. Rivian's new models hold the same sales growth and profitability potential..But beyond these three new vehicles, the future of Rivian isn't what you might expect. In fact, over the next 10 years, Rivian's most promising opportunity might not involve manufacturing vehicles at all.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-rivian-10-years-104500776.html,Market Risk

TSLA and Rivian Automotive RIVN are two noted names in the electric vehicle (EV) space — one is an established giant, the other a young and ambitious startup..Tesla changed the game years ago, creating massive wealth for early investors when EVs were still a niche bet. Back then, it was the clear frontrunner in a wide-open market. But times have changed. The EV landscape is now crowded, Tesla’s sales are showing signs of weakness, and its once-dominant brand doesn’t shine quite as brightly. The company still holds the title of the world’s most valuable automaker—by a wide margin—but it’s not without problems..Rivian, meanwhile, is still in its early chapters. This California-based company has bold plans and solid products, but it’s also deep in the red, grappling with losses and high cash burn, typical of most fast-growing startups..Over the past six months, shares of Tesla have underperformed Rivian..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.With growing uncertainty around EV policy under Trump’s presidency, the road ahead could be bumpy for both players..So, between Tesla’s legacy and Rivian’s potential, which stock deserves your attention now? Let’s take a closer look..Tesla’s position in the EV market isn’t as untouchable as it once seemed. After reporting its first-ever annual delivery decline in 2024, the company entered 2025 on shaky ground. First-quarter deliveries fell 13% year over year, with steep drops in key regions like Europe and China. Lower volumes, paired with aggressive discounting, have also eaten into profits. Automotive margins slipped to 11.3% in the last reported quarter, down from 15.5% in the first quarter of 2024..Tesla is no longer the only game in town. Legacy automakers are stepping up their EV offerings, while newer players continue to chip away at Tesla’s lead. As a result, Tesla’s U.S. EV market share has dropped below 50%, down from 63% in 2022. Simply put, it’s the only major EV maker with real market share to lose..CEO Elon Musk has already lowered growth expectations. After initially guiding for 20–30% vehicle delivery growth in 2025, Tesla has pulled back and hasn’t even reaffirmed the modest growth outlook. With uncertainty around global tariffs and ongoing weakness in China, investors are still waiting for clarity on this year’s targets..That said, Tesla isn’t without bright spots. Its Energy Generation and Storage division has quietly become its most profitable segment, with energy storage deployments growing at a staggering 180% CAGR over the past three years. In 2024, deployments jumped 113%, and they’re expected to grow by at least 50% this year too.

Hype is growing for this resurgent energy solution to help match demand from data centers and artificial intelligence, which are growing like gangbusters..However, risks abound for investors in this pre-revenue stock with a market cap above $10 billion. Here are two other industrial stocks I predict will be worth more than NuScale Power 10 years from now..First up, we have Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB), which has around the same market cap as NuScale Power. The first advantage Rocket Lab has over NuScale Power is the fact that it actually generates revenue. That's not a high bar, but a clear distinction that needs to be made. It is a disruptive rocket launch and space systems company nipping on the heels of SpaceX's dominant market share in the industry..With the Electron rocket, Rocket Lab regularly performs trips for commercial customers and the United States government, executing 59 successful launches and having 31 planned missions currently in its pipeline. It is the only company besides SpaceX to consistently launch payload rockets for customers, which they pay a pretty penny for..Besides rocket launches, Rocket Lab is working to build the systems that companies actually launch into space. This includes communication systems, solar panels, and payload vehicles. Over the long term, it is aiming to build its own constellation of satellites, although what it aims to do with these satellites is unclear..In the future, Rocket Lab will debut its Neutron rocket system, which is much larger than the Electron, translating into higher revenue per launch. Today, the company generates $466 million in revenue. Over the next few years, Rocket Lab has a chance to greatly grow its sales with the debut of the Neutron, expansion of its space systems, and working through its current product backlog of over $1 billion. This will get the company on a trajectory to be a much larger stock than NuScale Power in 10 years..A second stock that will be larger than NuScale Power in 10 years is Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN). This is a fallen angel in the electric vehicle space aiming to get its mojo back with new product launches. The stock is down 92% from all-time highs after its much-hyped initial public offering (IPO).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-worth-more-005000390.html,1.

The fate of automotive regulatory credits will be equally important.  Despite heavy volatility, Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) share prices have jumped nearly 20% in value over the past year.","Rivian could be hit by lower tax credits for EV buyers..The fate of automotive regulatory credits will be equally important..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Despite heavy volatility, Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) share prices have jumped nearly 20% in value over the past year. Part of that growth is tied to analyst expectations that revenue will jump by 10% this year, with another 48% growth anticipated in 2026. It's definitely a metric to follow. Apart from revenue growth, however, there are two other numbers that investors should be monitoring very closely..A new bill backed by President Donald Trump could eliminate tax credits for electric vehicle (EV) buyers. Currently, qualified buyers can receive anywhere from $4,000 to $7,500 in tax credits when they purchase an EV. While we don't have exact data for Rivian, surveys of other EV brands suggest that 36% to 53% of buyers wouldn't have purchased their EV without a tax credit..Rivian's current lineup largely doesn't qualify for federal tax incentives apart from a commercial leasing loophole. But next year, Rivian plans on releasing three new vehicles priced under $50,000 -- all of which would qualify for the current tax credits. If tax credits are eliminated, these new affordable models could face lower demand, as their effective cost for consumers would be higher..Investors should closely monitor what happens to federal tax credit values. But there's another federal program I'm watching even more closely..Last quarter, Rivian booked a $206 million gross profit -- only the second time the company has ever posted positive gross margins. This figure was significantly aided, however, by $157 million in automotive regulatory credit sales. Rivian accrues these credits from the federal government for producing zero-emission vehicles. It then sells these credits to competitors that don't produce enough zero-emission vehicles. These credits are received and sold at essentially no cost, making their margins nearly 100% profit..As with federal tax credits for EV buyers, these regulatory credits could be at risk. Rivian doesn't break down how much comes from federal versus state programs, but I'll be carefully monitoring their fate..Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Demand for electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next several decades.  While much of this growth is expected globally, penetration for EVs is still expected to rise substantially in the U.S., the primary market for both Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN).","Right now, Lucid Group is growing faster than Rivian..However, Rivian holds a huge, undervalued advantage..Lucid is going to need to produce more affordable vehicles..10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›.Demand for electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next several decades. While much of this growth is expected globally, penetration for EVs is still expected to rise substantially in the U.S., the primary market for both Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN)..If you're looking to invest in a company with the potential to be the next Tesla, there are reasons to consider both Lucid and Rivian. But which is a better stock to buy today?.When it comes to growth, Lucid is the clear winner right now. In fact, Lucid should be one of the fastest-growing EV makers over the next year or two. Analysts predict 73% sales growth this year, and another 96% growth expected in 2026. Rivian, for comparison, is expected to grow sales by just 5% this year, though that is expected to pick up to a roughly 40% pace in 2026..Why is Lucid growing faster than Rivian? Demand growth for both conventional and electric vehicles does vary from year to year. But for EV pure-plays, by far the biggest driver of growth is the introduction of new models..Earlier this year, Lucid began scaling up the production of its new Gravity SUV. SUVs are one of the highest-selling and fastest-growing categories of vehicles in the U.S. The introduction of the Gravity SUV also doubles Lucid's lineup. Previously, it only had a single model -- the Lucid Air sedan -- available to purchase. Now, its more diversified lineup and greater overall production should fuel heavy sales growth in both 2025 and 2026..There's just one problem: An EV from Lucid still costs anywhere from $70,000 to $249,000 depending on the exact model and package. The top of that range is for its luxury Air Sapphire model, but even the low end prices out the majority of North American buyers..To really fuel massive and long-term growth, more affordable options are needed. And while Lucid has teased plans for three affordable models, details about them have been scarce. Moreover, with less than $1.9 billion in cash on the books, it's not clear that the company has the capital to get these new vehicles into production anytime soon..Rivian, by contrast, has a huge advantage in this department..Over the past few decades, numerous electric car start-ups have gone under. Why? They ran out of money. Designing, building, and marketing a vehicle from scratch typically takes billions of dollars and perhaps a decade or more. All of this typically occurs when the start-up is still deeply unprofitable.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-electric-vehicle-ev-stock-114500186.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Regulatory Risk Industry Risk

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has a very promising future.  Starting in early 2026, management expects to start production of three new affordable electric vehicles (EVs).","Rivian is prepared to grow sales significantly regardless of tax incentives..But eliminating tax incentives could have an odd effect on Rivian's competitiveness..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has a very promising future. Starting in early 2026, management expects to start production of three new affordable electric vehicles (EVs). Making affordable EVs priced under $50,000 is a huge milestone for an automaker. When Tesla released its affordable Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, sales boomed. Today, those two vehicles account for more than 90% of Tesla's auto sales..Some recent news, however, could be a giant blow to Rivian's growth plans. President Donald Trump's new bill proposes cutting federal EV tax credits, which would make electric vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive to buyers. How much will Rivian suffer? The answer might surprise you..Many investors are looking over electric car stocks to find the next Tesla. It's a worthy mission. Tesla shares have risen 23,000% in value since 2010. What's the key to spotting the next Tesla? Look for companies that can launch affordable models priced under $50,000. As mentioned, reaching this milestone creates a gigantic growth catalyst, making the automakers' models affordable to tens of millions of new buyers..Right now, Rivian is right on track. After releasing two luxury models with premium price tags -- very similar to what Tesla achieved with its Model S and Model X vehicles -- Rivian is preparing to start production of three new affordable models: the R2, R3, and R3X. Production is slated to begin in early 2026, but I'm not expecting full production of all three models until 2027 or 2028. Still, there's no doubt that Rivian is prepared to hit its biggest growth milestone in years. With $4.7 billion in cash on the books, plus a deal with Volkswagen that could deliver several more billion dollars in capital, Rivian looks like it has the means to get these vehicles to market. That will allow sales to surge, and also provide significantly more operational leverage, likely improving profit margins..Regardless of whether the EV tax credits are eliminated, Rivian has the capital to reach this growth catalyst, meaning sales growth should be expected whatever the future brings. Right now, Rivian's vehicles are priced between $70,000 and $100,000 depending on the exact package.

This in-house platform features a more powerful computing system than that used in Rivian's earlier vehicles and is tailored specifically for its current and future models.RAP provides Level 2+ autonomy, meaning it supports the driver with alerts and interventions, such as steering corrections and emergency braking, but it never takes full control of the vehicle. The system includes a comprehensive set of ADAS tools, stepping in only when necessary.Standard on the R1T and R1S models, RAP’s features fall into two main categories: Driving Assist and Active Safety Assist. Driving Assist includes user-activated tools like Highway Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane-Change Assistance. Active Safety Assist includes automatic features aimed at preventing accidents, such as lane safety, lighting adjustments, parking and reversing aids, and collision mitigation. RIVN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the introduction of its second-generation R1 platform, Rivian has significantly upgraded RAP. The vehicles now use a revamped perception system and computing setup, including 55-megapixel cameras and onboard processing power exceeding 200 trillion operations per second. The platform’s AI-driven design and vertically integrated hardware allow Rivian to efficiently collect and process high-quality, multi-modal sensor data, giving it a competitive edge in ADAS development. Other automakers like Toyota Motor Corporation TM and Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, and Tesla TSLA are also making progress on the development of their respective autonomous vehicle platforms.In April, Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo reached a preliminary agreement to explore a collaboration focused on the development of a new autonomous vehicle platform. Toyota and GOOGL’s Waymo aim to combine their respective strengths to develop the platform. In parallel, the companies will explore how to leverage Waymo's autonomous technology and Toyota's vehicle expertise to enhance next-generation personally owned vehicles. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is a sophisticated driver-assistance technology designed to allow Tesla cars to navigate various driving conditions autonomously. FSD builds on Tesla’s existing Autopilot features and is sold as an optional upgrade. The company has long been a leader in autonomous vehicle development.

It keeps losing share in its key markets around the globe, especially in the United States, a trend that looks set to continue even though it has slashed prices on its best-selling electric vehicles (EVs)..Now, CEO Elon Musk has started publicly debating with President Donald Trump, and it is unclear whether this feud will truly affect Tesla's business. But it will definitely not be a positive development since taking political sides will inevitably alieniate a large customer cohort. It's a sceario that can cut both ways..Regardless, the company has already experienced much financial pain the last few years. At the same time, other EV stocks, such as Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN), have stayed stuck in the mud. Its shares are down over 90% from all-time highs and trade below $15..Is Tesla's pain going to be Rivian's gain, making the stock a buy right now?.Rivian made its debut on the stock market with a lot of excitement. It raised over $10 billion in its initial public offering and shot up to a market cap of over $100 billion..Investors were optimistic about the company -- which at the time generated zero revenue -- and its EV product pipeline and its deal with Amazon to build its new delivery vans..Since then, Rivian has started to produce cars for customers, but at a much smaller scale than initially thought. It still has a large 100,000 order to make electric vans for Amazon, and you can now see its vehicles regularly on roads in the United States..However, with the high price points of its trucks and SUVs, deliveries to customers have begun to flatten out. In 2025, the company is guiding for 40,000 to 46,000 deliveries. In 2024, it delivered over 50,000 vehicles..For reference, Tesla delivers close to 2 million cars globally each year, and while that figure has begun to fall, it is still significantly larger than Rivian's numbers..Selling cars that push a $100,000 price point is going to make your product unaffordable for most people in the U.S. This is why Rivian's share of EV sales has not grown significantly in reaction to Tesla's market share losses.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Automotive Dive newsletter. .NOVI, Mich. – Reviving a storied American truck brand was a task not taken lightly by Scout Motors..During a presentation at AutoTech 2025 last week, CTO Burkhard Huhnke detailed how the company is using the “digital twin” design approach to develop and test its fully electric and extended-range EVs..Scout’s goal is to preserve the vehicle's heritage through innovation and modern technology. The original Scout SUV was built by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980..Huhnke also confirmed that Scout vehicles will adopt a new zonal electrical architecture which was co-developed by joint venture partners Volkswagen and Rivian. The technique, which is also being used by Rivian, enables over-the-air updates, remote diagnostics and cloud connectivity to enhance customer value. For Rivian vehicles, the new architecture reduces the number of ECUs needed from 17 to seven and eliminates 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle, according to the company..“So what we are using is the most modern electronics architecture, which allows us with the pipeline into the cloud, a real-time access to the car,” said Huhnke..Among the technologies Scout is utilizing includes high-performance computing, simulation technology and software to create a “digital world” where various interactions — including crash tests — of vehicle designs can be simulated before physical testing in the real world. The automaker’s goal is to reduce test hours through simulation to achieve a high level of accuracy before physical prototyping begins..“You have to optimize your driving dynamics. You have to calibrate your brake system,” said Huhnke. “You have to do propulsion and dynamics optimization, and that’s how everyone does it. After the simulation phase, we run for physical testing.”.According to Huhnke, Scout’s vehicle development process will begin with the creation of a digital model. That environment also includes a “digital wind tunnel” to test and optimize the aerodynamics of Scout vehicles. The process includes running various simulations, then using Use AI and machine learning to optimize vehicle designs to improve aerodynamics. Huhnke says this approach can reduce iteration times from 24 hours to just 5 seconds in some cases..“What you’re getting is very quick … an AI response or design variables within seconds,” said Huhnke. “So you can run through multiple sessions within seconds to use AI and machine learning to optimize aerodynamics quite quickly. The highest accuracy in the digital world gives us the chance to reduce not just test properties, but also the test hours.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revival-scout-preserves-heritage-innovation-091300874.html,Market Risk: Low Operational Risk: Moderate Reputation Risk: Low Cybersecurity Risk: Low Regulatory Risk: Low Strategic Risk: Moderate Supply Chain Risk: Low

As a result, Tesla's stock lost about $150 billion in market capitalization in a single day (a new company record). The stock has recovered a bit of that 15% drop, but it is still down about 6% just since the end of May. It would seem that investors are getting increasingly pessimistic about Tesla's future. Its financials and leading trends look ugly right now..If you are an investor interested in owning electric vehicle (EV) stocks, does the recent fall by Tesla mean it's time to move to buy competitors such as Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) instead for your portfolio? Let's take a closer look at this smaller EV upstart and see if an answer presents itself..Since its peak in 2022, Tesla has begun to lose market share of EV sales in the United States. According to Car Edge, Tesla's estimated market share of U.S. EV sales fell from 75% in early 2022 to under 45% in the first quarter of 2025. These market share struggles are being seen in other large EV regions like Europe and China as well, although Rivian does not sell in those countries..The market share losses come at a time when Rivian has finally brought its EV products to market. These include a premium truck, SUV, and a commercial electric van (mainly sold to Amazon). However, if we look at market share estimates in the United States, Rivian is only at 2.9% of total EV sales in Q1 2025. This is actually down from a peak of 5% in Q3 2023. Tesla's market share losses have not gone to Rivian. Rather, they are going to legacy players upping their EV game, such as General Motors..Why is Rivian still so small? For one, the entire EV market has stalled in the United States. Plus, Rivian sells expensive vehicles with price points around $100,000 when including full upgrades. The vehicles have great reviews, but they are only affordable for a small segment of the United States population..In order to grow its market share of EV sales, Rivian is investing quickly to build a more affordable EV for shoppers. It is working on a product called the R2, which is an SUV that will cost around $45,000 before upgrades, with plans to start deliveries to customers in 2026. This product pipeline is what investors are betting on when buying Rivian stock right now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-crash-time-rotate-084000650.html,1. Market Risk: High 2.

28,2025-06-11 22:13:00,Prediction: Rivian Will Soar Over the Next 3 Years. Here Are 2 Reasons Why.,Rivian's sales have the potential to surge thanks to new affordable models.  Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock is priced at a bargain versus other electric car stocks like Tesla and Lucid Group.  A lot of this discount is due to investor concerns over lackluster sales growth in recent quarters.,"Rivian's sales have the potential to surge thanks to new affordable models..This potential sales surge will also help one other key financial indicator..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock is priced at a bargain versus other electric car stocks like Tesla and Lucid Group. Shares trade at just 3 times sales versus nearly 7 times sales for Lucid and just over 12 times sales for Tesla. A lot of this discount is due to investor concerns over lackluster sales growth in recent quarters..But looking ahead, Rivian's sales have the potential to explode..There are two things every EV manufacturer hopes to achieve long-term. The first is to reach positive gross margins. This means that the firm is making money on every car it sells when compared to the cost involved in manufacturing the vehicle. The second milestone is to release a ""mass market"" vehicle. That is, a vehicle considered affordable by the broader car-buying market, typically priced under $50,000..Rivian has already achieved the first milestone. Over the past two quarters, it has managed positive gross margins for the first time in company history. Looking ahead, it could achieve the second milestone by early next year. That's when management aims to start production of three new mass-market vehicles..The significance of these launches cannot be understated. Today, more than 90% of Tesla's vehicle sales come from its two affordable models: the Model Y and Model 3. When Rivian's new models start shipping to customers, expect two things. First, sales growth will likely surge, just as Tesla's did when it released its mass market vehicles. Second, gross margins will improve even further thanks to greater operating scale..The result -- surging sales growth with improved profitability -- should be a game changer for Rivian stock, which is currently priced at a discount to its peers. It may take a couple of years for this sales growth and profitability improvement to fully take hold, but once it does, expect Rivian shares to respond very positively given the current discounted valuation..Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

IS it Rivian's time to shine?","Tesla TSLA has been a polarizing stock over the last decade, delivering massive gains for investors as we increasingly shift toward EVs..And in 2025, shares have been volatile, down 30% overall with big price swings..Notably, the stock currently sports an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), with analysts revising their EPS expectations negatively across the board in a big way over recent months..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The downward revisions paint a challenging picture for TSLA’s share performance in the near term, and investors can expect a heightened level of volatility here given the stock’s historical nature..With that said, let’s take a closer look at its latest set of quarterly results and a big competitor, Rivian Automotive RIVN..Tesla reported Q1 revenue of $19.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.27 in its latest release, reflecting year-over-year declines of 9% and 50%, respectively. Still, results from Tesla’s Energy Generation & Storage segment reflected some positivity, with sales climbing 67% year-over-year to $2.7 billion..Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Concerning EV production/deliveries, Tesla delivered roughly 337k EVs and produced nearly 363k throughout the period..While the EV numbers are important, another critical aspect of the release was the margin picture, with the company’s gross margin contracting to 16.3% vs. a 17.4% print in the same period last year. Please note that the margins chart below is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The crunched profitability has been a big headwind for the stock, regularly dictating post-earnings price movements as of late..Rivian shares have been much stronger in 2025 so far, gaining 8% compared to Tesla’s 23% decline. Its latest set of quarterly results was primarily positive, with gross profit of $206 million reflecting a quarterly record..Notably, the company produced roughly 14.6k vehicles throughout the period, delivering 8.6k. While the numbers are miniscule compared to that of Tesla, the results remained in-line with management’s previous guidance, a critical hurdle to clear for any EV player..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.It’s worth noting here that while Rivian has 100% US vehicle manufacturing and sources most materials (excluding cells) in the US, it’s still not immune to the impacts of the current global trade and economic environment. The company revised its current-year guidance concerning vehicle deliveries as a result, now expecting FY25 deliveries in a range of 40-60k.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-vs-rivian-whats-currently-180000658.html,Risk Classification: Market Volatility/Stock Price Risks Risk Category: Business/Financial  Risk Level: Moderate

The partnership, in which Rivian agreed to deliver 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon by the end of 2030, was instrumental in helping the automaker survive during its early days..Just as important as that partnership, perhaps even more so, is Rivian's joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY), announced in November 2024. New details regarding that partnership point to an even deeper partnership than initially thought..Speaking to Yahoo! Finance on June 2, Rivian's chief software officer, Wassym Bensaid, revealed just how entrenched Rivian's technology is in the joint venture..""R2 is the platform that will underpin actually all future EV products at VW,"" Bensaid told the financial news website. ""So it's really that modular, scalable technology stack that we will take into VW brands, and we will do it in a way where we will still allow each of the brands to express their own identity."".The key point of that statement, when Bensaid mentions multiple brands expressing their identity, is sneaky. That means that Volkswagen's plethora of brands -- including Audi, Porsche, and Lamborghini, among others -- will all have access to Rivian's platform and technology stack. In other words, a future Porsche EV could have a Rivian backbone..This development means a couple of things for investors. First, it is a huge vote of confidence for the German automotive juggernaut Volkswagen to entrust a newcomer to automotive manufacturing and technology with the core of its future EV product line. For Rivian, this proves to other equipment manufacturers that it is a capable and strategic technology partner. It's, of course, a positive development for Volkswagen as well, a company that has had massive problems, delays, and setbacks in developing software over the years..Second, this gives Rivian a very real revenue stream outside of its traditional manufacturing and selling of EVs. It's already had an impact on the company's financials, with software and services revenue jumping to $318 million, compared to the prior year's $88 million, driven primarily by revenue generated from the Volkswagen joint venture.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-receives-huge-vote-confidence-084500985.html,- Market Risk - Partnership Risk - Industry Risk - Regulatory Risk - Operational Risk - Liquidity Risk

With that, it hit the gross profit milestone outlined in its agreement with German auto giant Volkswagen VWAGY and expects to receive another $1 billion in funding by the end of this month..Rivian’s deal with Volkswagen is a major catalyst for the EV maker. Volkswagen will invest up to $5.8 billion in Rivian and their joint venture (JV) by 2027. So far, it has invested $1 billion through a convertible note and an additional $1.3 billion upon finalization of the JV in the fourth quarter of 2024. The remaining $3.5 billion will be provided over the next few years, of which $1 billion will be secured by June end. The partnership focuses on developing Rivian’s next-generation electrical architecture and software, starting with the R2 model. The JV will leverage Rivian’s existing technology to support the launch of the R2 in the first half of 2026..With additional funding on the way, is it a good time to buy RIVN stock now? The stock is under $15 now and is up just around 5% so far in 2025. Could this be a good entry point? Let’s find out..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The excitement around EVs in the United States appears to be cooling. A new American Automobile Association survey shows that only 16% of Americans are likely to buy an EV as their next car, which is the lowest level since 2019. High costs remain a major barrier. Most respondents cited battery repair expenses and steep purchase prices as key concerns. In March, the average EV cost was over $59,000, compared to about $47,000 for all vehicles..This declining sentiment comes alongside political headwinds. A House budget bill passed in May aims to roll back clean energy incentives, including the $7,500 EV tax credit. If passed by the Senate, this could further stall adoption..U.S. EV giant Tesla TSLA is already feeling the pressure. Tesla’s sales are falling and Chinese EV brands are gaining ground globally. Rivian, which targets the premium U.S. market, is not immune either. The company targets to deliver 40,000-46,000 vehicles in 2025, below last year’s total of 51,579..Still, Rivian is adapting. Rivian is following a path similar to Tesla’s, aiming to expand its market with the lower-cost R2, expected to start around $45,000— well below the luxury R1 lineup. While demand for Rivian vehicles may be a concern in the near term, the long-term story for Rivian remains intact, especially if affordability improves and infrastructure expands.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-1b-vwagy-soon-time-141300777.html,1.

The dirty little industry secret, if you can call it a secret, is that full-size trucks cost only marginally more to produce than a passenger car, yet the former can sell for two to three times as much..Full-size truck sales are the backbone of Detroit automakers, but as the industry transitions to electric vehicles the scene may be set to change. In fact, the EV industry might have a truck problem, and that would be horrible news for auto investors..Long, long ago Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk essentially mocked stereotypical trucks noting their stale design. Perhaps that's why the young EV maker swung for the fences with the Cybertruck's controversial design..But the unique design didn't stir up sales as much as it stirred conversation. Originally predicted to reach annual sales between 250,000 to half a million units, the Cybertruck has been a commercial flop. It reached only 40,000 U.S. registrations last year, and while that was good enough to be the top EV pickup truck, it was a fraction of original estimates. Because Tesla doesn't break out its sales per model, registrations can serve as a proxy to sales..Ford's highly anticipated F-150 Lightning also disappointed compared to initial hype. Ford noted before the truck's launch it had 200,000 reservations and anticipated producing 150,000 trucks annually. Its actual results were a more modest 24,695 registrations in 2023 before growing to 32,893 in 2024..Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), which only offers the R1T, R1S, and its electric delivery van, relies on its truck for a substantial chunk of its business, but also saw less-than-thrilling results. Rivian last reported its backlog in late 2022 at 114,000 for the R1T and R1S combined, and not only did its registrations of 11,311 feel lackluster in 2023, they actually declined to 9,876 last year..The problem facing investors and their love of truck profits is twofold. On one end, we have the consumer issue, which is the stigma that electric powertrains are forced to their brink when it comes to performance and towing.

Rivian was entering a year with no major vehicle launch, stagnating deliveries, and a lack of any visible catalysts, while Lucid has strung together six consecutive quarters of record deliveries and is ramping the production of its new Gravity SUV. One thing they both have in common is a growing, albeit more slowly than hoped, electric vehicle (EV) market. Here's the bad news: Some recent data says that the EV market sentiment looks to be souring..Tesla changed the game when it made EVs ""cool"" for the first time. Since then, the hype surrounding EVs as the future of transportation has swept the globe, in some countries (like China) faster than in others. But according to a recent survey, that hype could be in decline in the U.S..Interest in EVs spiraled to its lowest level since 2019, according to a consumer survey commissioned by AAA. Only 16% of respondents reported being ""likely"" or ""very likely"" to purchase an EV as their next vehicle, signaling consumer caution. The percentage of respondents who indicated they would be ""unlikely"" or ""very unlikely"" to purchase an EV as their next vehicle jumped from 51% to 63%, the highest mark since 2022. The percentage who believe that most cars will be electric within the next decade fell from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year..Not only is interest in EVs down, there's also the lingering pessimism surrounding battery repair costs, total costs, and charging infrastructure -- a story as old as EVs themselves. More specifically, 62% of respondents noted high battery repair costs as a main reason for avoiding going electric, while purchase price was cited by 59% of respondents..The hesitation when it comes to purchase price is understandable. The average transaction price for a new EV in March was $59,205, far higher than the overall average transaction price of $47,462, according to data from Cox Automotive. As far as consumer concerns go, 56% of respondents had the fear of running out of charge while driving, and 55% noted a lack of convenient public charging stations..The waning consumer sentiment goes hand in hand with the Trump administration's effort to pull support from the EV industry. House Republicans passed a budget bill on May 22 that will reduce federal incentives for battery manufacturing, as well as other clean energy projects. If the Senate approves it, it would cut the section of the bill that provides the $7,500 EV tax credit.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/little-bad-news-rivian-lucid-150500685.html,Regulatory Risk Market Sentiment Risk Commodity Risk Industry-Specific Risk

This move aligns with efforts to streamline financial operations, complementing an improved earnings performance characterized by a net loss reduction.

In fact, Rivian has entered into a valuable partnership with Germany's Volkswagen.","Rivian is a relatively young American company that builds electric vehicles..A key part of Rivian's business model is to sell its U.S. designed technology to others..In fact, Rivian has entered into a valuable partnership with Germany's Volkswagen..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) is a high-tech auto start-up that builds all-electric trucks and delivery vans. It has made a huge amount of progress with its business as it looks to become a sustainably profitable company..That said, it still has a long way to go before it gets to that point -- which is why the $3.5 billion it is charging Germany's Volkswagen for access to its tech is so important. Here's what you need to know..As noted, Rivian is a U.S. automaker focused on electric vehicles, or EVs. It has honed in on a niche within the industry, as it only makes trucks and delivery vehicles, which are basically just a different kind of truck. It has a prominent partnership with Amazon, which has used Rivian trucks to support its expanding delivery efforts. That is basically just a traditional customer relationship since Amazon is simply buying delivery vehicles..Still, the Amazon partnership has been very important. It provided Rivian with a reliable customer for its products at a time when it was just beginning to ramp up its production capabilities. It now has the capacity to produce around 50,000 EVs a year, which means it is running at scale. In fact, the effort in 2024 and 2025 has focused around streamlining production to improve profitability..Its factory produces both consumer vehicles and delivery vehicles, but the Amazon relationship was a huge help. And it highlights one of Rivian's key goals -- selling its products to other companies. In the case of Amazon, that was a more typical customer relationship, but Rivian's aspirations include selling its technology to other companies, too..This is where Germany's Volkswagen comes into the story. It has a long-term partnership with Rivian in which it is providing the upstart company with funding. Volkswagen has pumped cash into Rivian on multiple occasions as Rivian has continued to hit important development milestones. For example, Rivian ""unlocked"" $1 billion in cash from the German auto giant in the first quarter of 2025. That cash isn't expected to fully hit the balance sheet until the end of June 2025, but it will be an important infusion of funds as Rivian continues to invest in its business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-ev-maker-charging-germany-113200219.html,1.

Tesla has lost its growth profile and is struggling to ship more units to customers. Chinese brands are taking increasing share in markets outside the United States. One EV upstart stuck in the mud is Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN). The maker of high-end trucks and SUVs is experiencing falling deliveries to customers and is struggling to generate positive cash flow..The stock has fallen back below $15 as I write this, and is well off all-time highs from near its initial public offering. Does this make the stock a good buy-the-dip candidate today?.The narrative around Rivian Automotive is sound. It is building premium EVs in America, tackling the high-end truck and SUV market, which has strong profit characteristics. It's got new factories under construction and more affordable vehicles coming down the line. And don't forget its EV delivery van product, which has a huge contract from Amazon -- an investor in the company -- as well as other buyers..These tailwinds are not showing up in the numbers today. Rivian expects to deliver 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles this year, compared to 51,579 in 2024. Demand seems to be waning for Rivian vehicles as it serves the high end of the EV space in the United States, which is quite niche..This is a problem that also happened to Tesla before it introduced its more affordable vehicles. Rivian hopes the same can occur with its upcoming R2 product, with plans for a starting price of $45,000..Encouragingly, Rivian has increased its profitability, bringing gross profit to a positive figure in the last two quarters. However, free cash flow is still deeply negative at a $1.86 billion burn over the last 12 months. The company needs more scale and better efficiency in order to build a sustainable business. It has made some progress in this regard, but still has a long slog ahead..Rivian's cash burn is ugly, but it has a lot of funding sources to help it keep building its production capacity over the next few years. There is still $7.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, along with funding commitments from Volkswagen as part of a joint venture and a proposed $6.6 billion loan from the U.S. government. Volkswagen is a development and software partner for Rivian and plans to invest billions into the stock if Rivian can hit operational and gross profit milestones.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-stock-dips-below-15-223500476.html,1.

Shares of the company have increased in value by 27,000% since 2010. A small initial investment could have become hundreds of thousands of dollars over that time. Tesla's high-profile leader, Elon Musk, has pushed the company into many lucrative verticals, everything from electric vehicles and solar power to distributed energy and robotaxis..While no electric car competitor may reach Tesla's $1 trillion market cap anytime soon, it would still be very profitable to find the next Tesla, at least in terms of a small EV business ready to scale aggressively. No Tesla competitor looks to have more growth upside over the next few years than Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN). In fact, I think buying Rivian shares now could really pay off. Just be aware of the risks before jumping in..To buy a stock for life you need to be confident that the underlying business can continue growing for decades to come. When it comes to electric vehicle demand, the macro landscape is very promising. Right now, less than 10% of U.S. vehicle sales are electric. By 2030, however, market penetration could approach 20%, according to some estimates, a more than doubling over just five years..Longer term, the growth prospects are even more encouraging. Some developed countries already have EV penetration rates above 90%. By 2040, we could see a majority of U.S. sales being electric, providing a multidecade growth runway for EV manufacturers to sell into..Which companies will dominate this growth opportunity? Manufacturers that can deliver low-cost EVs for the masses. Most EVs right now are priced as luxury options. Tesla's Model X and Model S vehicles, for example, can cost upward of $100,000, depending on options. But more than 90% of Tesla's sales come from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles -- later-generation EVs with starting prices below $50,000. Tesla got its start with luxury EVs, but it was its low-priced models that really put it on the map..Right now, Rivian is behind Tesla in terms of reaching this mass market. It has only two luxury vehicles, both priced at $70,000 or above. But that should all change next year when Rivian begins producing its first mass-market model, the R2, which will be followed up by even more affordable options like the R3 and R3X. All of these models are expected to debut under $50,000.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-buying-rivian-stock-today-221500871.html,Investment Risk

A new software platform intended to enable Level 4 autonomous driving was pushed back to the end of the decade..Sign up for the Automotive News Europe Segment Analysis newsletter, a monthly in-depth look at a segment of the car market, including sales and market share data.When Bosch arrived in summer 2023 from Bentley, Cariad’s reputation was in tatters..Since then, Bosch, a former Oliver Wyman consultant, has led a broad reorganization. He realigned development processes with the group’s brand structure, slashed costs and pushed for tighter control of code..His actions include ending over-reliance on external system suppliers. Bosch said the traditional outsourcing model does not work for modern automotive software..“In software, with its fast development cycles, we have to work directly on the code,” he said. “Our employees know, write, understand, and change the code — even via over-the-air updates.”.VW’s long-term goal is a fully software-defined vehicle architecture with centralized computing and proprietary code. “We now do a lot ourselves, faster and more cost-effectively,” Bosch said. “We must master the code.”.Cariad contributed software to 14 models released in 2024. Bosch said that in April, nine of the 10 top-selling electric vehicles in Germany were VW Group models equipped with Cariad software..The company has overhauled its workforce structure, introduced agile delivery units and reduced management layers.

RIVN is rolling out a new over-the-air software update to add manual preconditioning for the high-voltage battery for DC fast charging to R1S and R1T. This update, available for both Gen 1 and Gen 2 models, enables users to precondition the battery pack in preparation for fast charging without relying on the vehicle’s built-in navigation system. A banner will now notify drivers when the battery is warming or cooling and when the process is complete.In addition to battery preconditioning, the software version 2025.18 includes a redesigned Energy App with two distinct tabs. The Energy Monitor provides detailed insights into energy consumption by different systems, while the Charging Tab features a smart reminder that alerts users when to unplug during long trips. If a destination is set in the car’s navigation, the system estimates when the battery has sufficient charge to reach the endpoint, which potentially reduces the need to charge up to 80% each time and saves time on the road.Charging speeds have also been improved for some versions of the R1S and R1T. The DC fast charge time for the first-generation with the Max Pack battery has been reduced. Similar enhancements have been applied to second-generation models with Max and Standard Packs. Additionally, Gen 2 vehicles with the Large Pack can now reach a peak charging rate of 215 kW, with shorter charging times for 10-80% top-ups.Though not revolutionary, as similar features have long been available in Tesla TSLA EVs, the latest updates reflect Rivian’s commitment to refining its EV user experience.

These products can be profitable, but with large price tags they have a limited addressable market..In the future, Rivian is pinning its hopes on more affordable midsize SUVs. First up will be the R2 vehicle, which is coming hopefully in 2026 and will cost $45,000 at the base level. Further on in this decade will be the R3, a much more affordable small SUV expected to cost $37,000. These price points will make Rivian vehicles much more affordable for the average American looking for a car compared to its current vehicles, which can run up close to $100,000 with add-on features..This is needed quickly, because Rivian's deliveries to customers have stalled out and actually declined in recent quarters. Customers love the product, but with a high price point there is only so much demand you will get..These cheaper models can hopefully boost deliveries for the rest of the decade and help Rivian achieve even more scale. Scale is vital in the automotive business due to the high fixed costs of manufacturing cars. This is why Rivian's gross margin is barely positive and free cash flow was negative $1.86 billion over the last 12 months..Demand for EVs is set to grow over the next 10 to 20 years. Analysts estimate that around 20% of car purchases in the United States currently come from battery electric vehicles or hybrid cars. Eventually, close to 100% of new car purchases should be from EVs -- and of these purchases, more and more should come from full battery-electric cars like those Rivian sells.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-future-look-bright-rivian-110000879.html,Competition Risk Regulatory Risk Financial Risk Operational Risk

For more on the latest numbers and the state of the auto industry, let's welcome in here Kevin Roberts, Car Gurus's director of economic and market intelligence. Kevin, always good to see you. So, auto sales for May, Kevin, just looking, I mean, nice sales gains. I'm looking at Ford sales jumped about 16%, Kevin. Truck sales, strong, hybrid strong, EV not great. Toyota looks like an increase about 7% in May. We heard from Hyundai and Kia as well. Just broadly, when you looked over that data, Kevin, how would you characterize it? What would you make of it? .Yeah, it was, uh, I would say a return to normal. So, uh, I like to say end of March, early April was kind of a crazy time for the auto industry when the tariffs were first announced. May was a little bit more back to normal, uh, traditionally a really strong kind of sales month for the industry. Um, you know, end of tax season, we have, uh, Memorial Day sales. So that's been really kind of helpful for the industry. And you mentioned it, several automakers really had some strong months. Couple things I think really kind of helped there. Ford had their employee pricing for all, uh, you know, vehicle affordability has been a trend we've really been highlighting for a while now. So I think that kind of discounts really kind of helped drive sales there. And then you mentioned hybrids. That's one that helped for both Ford and Toyota. Um, hybrid sales continue to see really strong growth. Consumers really like hybrids, and Ford and particularly Toyota are really dominant in hybrid power trains, which is helping to drive sales. .Do you think we saw some pull forward in those numbers too, though, Kevin? You know, folks trying to get ahead of tariffs? .That is the million dollar question for the auto industry right now. Uh, how much, if if we did see pull ahead, how much did we see pull ahead? And where might that start to bite back? Um, you know, was that kind of Q2 sales towards the end of the quarter that we pulled that from, or was it later in the year? It's really an unknown at this point. Uh, did we just kind of shake people off the sidelines who, you know, weren't in the market, or did we kind of pull ahead a lot of volume, uh, in those kind of crazy weeks after the tariffs were announced? And it's, it's, it's a major unknown for the industry right now. .Kevin, you know, tariffs in place. So do you think these automakers, do they maintain pricing, Kevin, or would you expect, no, starting here in June, perhaps, we're, we're going to see prices start rising? .Yeah, so we've been monitoring what's been happening to the average list price of vehicles on the site. Uh, somewhat surprising, we haven't seen large shifts, uh, to this point. However, like you said, a lot of automakers I think we're kind of in a wait and see approach after the tariffs were announced. And we're starting to see a trickle of some announcements of, uh, price increases as we get into June. Uh, and that's going to be a trend we kind of monitor, um, to see if that continues and if we start to see some of that expected price inflation, uh, for vehicles as we move into the second half of the year. .What did you make of the reaction in some names, um, this week, Kevin, for GM, for example, moving lower as Trump talked tough on steel tariffs? .Yeah, so it, it's a little bit of a different situation than if we would have talked a month or two ago. Uh, we had another executive order signed towards the end of April, uh, which gave hierarchy to stop stacking of a number of tariffs. And so that should stop, um, section 232 auto tariffs from being stacked with those steel and aluminum tariffs. So there is some protection for the auto industry. Now, it's important to keep in mind that those, that kind of protection only exists for, uh, finished vehicles and parts covered in those tariffs specifically. So for parts not covered there, we could see an impact there. And I think that's what you, that, uh, uh, that kind of risk is where you're seeing that shift this week. .By the way, should kind of just see a breaking news headline here. Uh, according to the White House, UK steel tariffs, they're going to remain at 25% for now. Um, lastly, Kevin, on Tesla, I want your views there. There, we did get some numbers this week. Broadly, weak sales for Tesla in Europe. What do you make of that, Kevin? Is that branding? Is that, you know, the Model Y change over? Is that more competition for Musk over there? Is it all three? .So, uh, we, Tesla is a direct to consumer automaker, so we don't get their data in, in our listing data, so a little bit difficult to say there. What I can say from the used side of the market, even with all the noise around Tesla recently, still, uh, still seems pretty strong, uh, demand for used Teslas out in the marketplace. So can't, can't comment as much on the new side of the market, but used side still sees, uh, uh, strong interest for used Teslas. .Interesting. Kevin, always great to have you on the show. Thanks so much for your time. .My pleasure. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/auto-sales-see-return-normal-214420358.html,Market Risk Economic Risk Regulatory Risk

The German giant would have access to Rivian’s zonal architecture and systems for EVs, and Rivian received the cash — and time — for its future product buildout, including the R2 mid-sized SUV..A good deal, for sure, for both sides. VW's software initiatives had hit snags, most significantly with its CARIAD software unit, which led to big delays for its EVs in the Porsche and Audi portfolio. As for Rivian, it still isn’t making money, though it did reach some profitability milestones last quarter. The upstart electric vehicle maker needs the billions provided by VW to update its factory and get R2 into production..Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s chief software officer and co-head of the Rivian-VW joint venture, aims to right the ship for VW and help get Rivian software products to as many users as possible..Bensaid’s team is responsible for the entire technology stack that underpins Rivian vehicles and the “end-to-end user experience” — think software updates and software for the Rivian Charging network. Since November, he’s been co-CEO of the joint venture with VW Group..Bensaid said Rivian’s upcoming R2, a midsize Tesla (TSLA) Model Y competitor, is a major key to the deal..""R2 is the platform that will underpin actually all future EV products at VW,"" Bensaid said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. ""So it's really that modular, scalable technology stack that we will take into VW brands, and we will do it in a way where we will still allow each of the brands to express their own identity."".With that platform and tech stack, Rivian will offer almost an “off-the-shelf” solution for Volkswagen to use for its upcoming ID1 EV. But the plan is that other VW brands like Skoda and Audi would get access to the R2 platform to use as they please..""Each brand will have their own UI, look and feel,"" Bensaid said. ""Each brand will have their own suspension tuning … but underneath the guts of the vehicle will be optimized based on the same technology and software architecture."".Speaking of the R2, Rivian is slated to begin production in the first half of 2026, with the first models rolling off the line sometime after that..“R2 is an evolution of the architecture that we introduced with our [R1] Gen2 vehicles, and there's a ton of lessons learned that went into how we make the R2 from a technology standpoint, from engineering [to] ... manufacturing,"" Bensaid said.

50,2025-05-31 16:05:00,Prediction: Rivian Stock Is a Buy Before Aug. 5,"Rivian's revenue growth rates are about to spike.  Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) investors have been very happy over the past month.  There are three major reasons investors should consider buying Rivian shares before the company's next earnings call, which is expected to occur sometime around Aug. 5.","Rivian's revenue growth rates are about to spike..Bigger scale will improve profitability..The stock's valuation doesn't fully account for these catalysts..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) investors have been very happy over the past month. The valuation of this electric car stock has surged by roughly 40%. Looking under the hood, however, it's easy to project significantly more growth to come. There are three major reasons investors should consider buying Rivian shares before the company's next earnings call, which is expected to occur sometime around Aug. 5..Rivian has been experiencing a period of sluggish sales growth in recent years. Its R1T model was released back in 2021, with the R1S variant launched the following year. Sales grew significantly after their launch, but with price tags that can approach $100,000 depending on options, the total addressable market for these vehicles was always rather small. Rivian's flatlining sales growth in recent years suggests the company has reached a level of market saturation with the only two vehicles in its lineup..All of this should change next year when the company begins shipping the first of three new models: the R2, R3, and R3X. All three are expected to have price tags of under $50,000, unlocking millions of new potential buyers that can finally afford one of the company's products. Analysts expect only 5% sales growth in 2025, a figure that bumps up to 41% in 2026. Once production of these models starts to scale, however, revenue growth could explode in 2027 and beyond..Last year, Rivian's management team promised investors it would achieve a positive gross margin by the end of the year. It took until the final quarter, but the company delivered. Last quarter, its gross margin improved even further into positive territory, matching Tesla's profitability levels..The biggest factor in achieving profitability as an electric vehicle manufacturer is achieving scale. The more cars a company sells, the more fixed costs can be spread over a larger volume of sales. If Rivian's mass market vehicles experience as much sales success as Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, expect Rivian to experience significant operating leverage, pushing profitability even higher..The two factors above won't be realized before the company's next earnings call. In fact, it will take several more quarters for Rivian's new models to hit the market. From there, it may take another year or so for production to fully scale. The reason to buy Rivian now isn't that there are near-term milestones that will be reached over the next few months. Instead, the valuation simply looks way too cheap to pass up, even if investors have to wait a year or two for the biggest catalysts to arrive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-rivian-stock-buy-aug-080500794.html,Financial Risk: High Market Risk: Medium Operational Risk: Medium Credit Risk: Low Liquidity Risk: Medium

Is that what that deal is all about? Is basically Volkswagen saying, Hey Rivian, you guys have great software. You know, we're talking about a vehicle that they were able to update the software to make the suspension better, believe it or not. Is that what we're talking about here when we talk about software-defined vehicles? .That's exactly it. I mean, when you look at the technology trends in automotive technologies, like electrification, autonomy, connectivity, they are resulting in much bigger amounts of software. And customers now have very high expectations in terms of the end-to-end experience. And modern architecture require a lot of software to really power and unlock that experience. .The R2 prototype, Wassim, is on the streets. It's been It's being tested. What do you love about it?

It's really the culmination of a long journey in terms of building our technology, so that we can get it into a vehicle that many more customers can now access. .So talk to me about your also the co-head, you mentioned like you mentioned of the JV between Volkswagen and Rivian. What does that entail and are we going to see that R2 technology kind of flow into VW vehicles, for instance? .Yeah, exactly. I mean, think about it as the R2 is the platform that will underpin actually all future EV products at VW. So, it's really that modular, scalable technology stack that we will take into VW brands. And we will do it in a way where we will still allow each of the brands to express their own identity. Each brand will have their own UI, look and feel. Each brand will have their own suspension tuning, as you mentioned, but underneath, the guts of the vehicle will be optimized based on the same technology and software architecture. .There are questions out there, Wassim, about R2 scalability. Walk me through how you're thinking about that dynamic. .Scalability, you mean, from which standpoint? .Well, the ability to get as many of those many of them out there as people want. .Yes. I mean, everybody is waiting for the R2. Everybody is exciting about the R2. It's the absolute number one priority for the customer.

The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Rivian Automotive belongs, has gained 21.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Rivian Automotive is expected to post a loss of $0.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.6%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.49 points to a change of +38.4% from the prior year.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Rivian Automotive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-inc-rivn-attracting-130014406.html,Market Risk - Company Spotlight

STLA is reportedly winding down its collaboration with Amazon AMZN to create in-car software with connected products and services. The joint project, Stellantis SmartCockpit, was started three years ago as part of STLA’s goal to generate $22.5 billion annually from software..The JV aimed to transform the driving experience by integrating sophisticated vehicle software enabling detection of the driver, personalization of the thermostat, navigation and other settings. Stellantis hoped this technology would enhance its competitiveness against software-focused rivals like Tesla..However, in the process, Stellantis faced the challenge of implementing software across 14 brands. Other traditional automakers have also struggled to add sophisticated software. It is reported that Amazon staff working on this project have either been reassigned or no longer with the company..The in-car software revenue strategy laid out by Stellantis included three key components, an electrical and software architecture system called Brain, a platform to deliver applications to the driver called STLA SmartCockpit and an automated driving platform called AutoDrive..While the partnership with Amazon on SmartCockpit is ending, Stellantis remains committed to the broader SmartCockpit concept and is now expected to pivot to a Google Android-based system for its future software interface..Having said that, STLA’s relationship with AMZN is not fully ending.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Automotive Dive newsletter. .Electric vehicle maker Rivian achieved its second consecutive quarterly gross profit in Q2, which triggered a $1 billion cash infusion from partner Volkswagen Group, CEO and founder RJ Scaringe said during a call with analysts May 6..The funds, which executives expect to receive by the end of June, will aid Rivian in deploying its technology and software stack to a wide array of vehicles by capitalizing on VW’s scale as it pushes for broader EV adoption, according to Scaringe. .“The relationship there continues to progress really well,” Scaringe said of the partnership. “At this point, we're very focused on executing a lot of programs across the Volkswagen Group.”.In addition to financial support from VW, Rivian’s efforts to scale production has also been bolstered by a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan finalized in January to revive the company’s stalled Georgia EV factory project, which is expected to start production by 2028. .The company is also investing $120 million in Normal, Illinois, where it is constructing a supplier park meant to create an electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem next to its production plant where it is building the R2 SUV. .However, like other automakers, Rivian also faces tariff-fueled headwinds necessitating plans to offset higher duties on automotive parts, especially battery components.     .CFO Claire McDonough said on the call that the company expected “per unit direct impact from tariffs to be a couple thousand dollars for 2025 based off of the currently announced tariffs in place.”.Rivian’s chief concern is rising cost for battery materials. McDonough said while the company’s stockpile of batteries is sufficient to carry its production through early 2026, it continues to monitor export restrictions on rare earth minerals from China. .“We are actively monitoring these developments and working to mitigate potential risks through a variety of initiatives, including strategic sourcing and proactive engagement with policymakers,” she said. .Higher component costs due to tariffs moved Rivian to raise its capital expenditure guidance to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Uncertainty fueled by economic policies also led the company to revise its delivery outlook to 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles, down from 46,000 to 51,000 announced April 2. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-secures-1b-infusion-vw-085600946.html,- Regulatory risk: High - Market risk: High - Credit risk: Medium - Liquidity risk: Low - Operational risk: Medium - No risk: None

Don't forget to catch up on Good Buy or Goodbye..Well, it is a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to good buy or good buy. Our goal here to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. Today, we are looking under the hood of the EV market amid tariff tensions. I'm here now with Granite Shares founder and CEO, that would be Will Ryan. Will, great to see you as always. .Good to see you too, Josh. .So, let's start with what you like, Will, and your first take here, your buy would be Rivian, and we're going to go through the reasons why. And check out that one year performance. Look at that chart. First reason, Will, and walk us through these bullets. Tenant for alternative to Tesla trade, walk us through that. .So this one has kind of two meanings, that on the one hand, I think there's still a huge amount of enthusiasm for EV stocks more broadly, but Tesla, perhaps quite rightly, steals all the oxygen from the conversation. So, this is a one about something is an alternative, an EV company, there's an alternative to Tesla, but it's also partly the brand issues that Tesla has suffered and people looking for an alternative investment if Tesla no longer fits their investment profile. .All right, bullet point number two, this one, this one made in America, no tariffs, Will. .So, maybe quite self-explanatory, but this really sort of fits the zeitgeist at the moment, meaning a company that is sitting right in the good side, or on the good side of the trade war. Vehicles are made here in America. It's EVs, no tariffs or minimal tariffs versus other companies. .President Trump, it never hurts. Yeah. .All right, now third one, Will, here's another reason you say stick with the buy on this one. Existing models well received and new models are on the way. .So the, the existing models have been very well received. You know, the company makes high-end SUVs and pickup trucks, really kind of a status symbol in many ways, and so, like companies like a Jaguar Land Rover with the Range Rover, they've been successful in building models that are perhaps less expensive, accessing a new type of customer. So, Rivian here with its new models along the way, lower cost models, accessing both a new customer and diversifying the existing customer base. .And all right, so you've made your case here, Will. Now, before our viewers they're convinced, they're ready to hit the buy button, before they do, let's give them the risks at least. What should be on their radar? What's the number one worry before you hit that buy button? .Well, I think the number one issue for anybody with a company like Rivian is the pathway to consistent long-term profitability. So, this is still a young company in the grand scheme of things. It's a company that is growing quickly, but it's a company that's also needs a lot of investment, a lot of capital expenditure. So, there are clearly big risks when it comes to companies of this kind of profile, just like there were in the early days of Tesla. As Elon talked about many times of the company had its, its sort of flirtations with bankruptcy. And so here, the risk with a company like Rivian is that it too has to execute, execute, continue to, to raise cash and generate the sustainable path to profitability. .All right, so that's what you like. Let's also turn to one you're not such a fan of. One you would avoid, that would be Stellantis. Now I could see that chart. Let's look through the reasons for this. Tariff challenges. .So, again, kind of the opposite way here, but given we're talking about this tariff zeitgeist, you know, this is a company that makes a lot of the vehicles are made in Canada or in Mexico. And as we know, big uncertainty at the moment in terms of how this all plays out vis-a-vis tariffs, but they're not made principally in America. .All right, bullet point number two, another reason Will says to avoid it, declining revenue aging product lineup. .Yeah, so this is in many senses not a new story, you know, revenue has been declining for, for quite some time. You know, the brands that the company has in its stable are brands that everybody knows, but at the same time, you know, we haven't seen that sort of new exciting product range from a lot of the brands that we've become perhaps used to with some other manufacturers. .And the final reason you would avoid this one Will, lagging EV strategy, walk us through that. .So again, just I think on the wrong side of history in the grand scheme of things, that if we're talking about on the one side, you know, EV companies that are long-term aspirational, this is a company that I'm sure wants to get there, but just hasn't quite, you know, had that strategy on the EV side to put itself in a position to compete actively with the leaders in the space currently. .All right, so you're bearish, but in terms of upside risks to this call, good cash reserves, effective CEO. .So, again, like the good news about some of these legacy companies is that, you know, it's a company that has a solid foundation, has good cash reserves, and this is nothing that can't be fixed over the long term. So with a CEO that's effective that can turn the company around with a refresh of the product offering that it has and numerous brands, there of course is a way with an EV, a credible EV strategy that this can all be turned around just like many big companies where the execution's the risk. .Buy Rivian, avoid Stellantis. Well, thank you so much for your time today. Appreciate it. .Thank you, Josh. That was great.

For comparison, UBS estimates Rivian’s estimated 2024 U.S. BEV market share, excluding vans, was around 3%..The survey also found that while many consumers still seek more EV alternatives, interest in EVs overall has declined..“Given potential pushout of EPA requirements and repeal of the California waiver, the EV inflection may be further out than expected,” UBS warned, noting that removing the California waiver could also impact Rivian’s ability to generate and sell Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits..Affordability also remains a key barrier, according to the bank..“Only ~35% of respondents believed EVs are affordable vs. ICE vehicles,” UBS noted. Rivian’s current models—the R1S SUV and R1T pickup—start at $75,900 and $69,900, respectively, well above the $47,900 average price for a U.S. vehicle..UBS also flagged risk around the possible elimination of consumer clean vehicle tax credits, which they estimate supported around 59% of Rivian’s 2024 vehicle leases..“Near-term, especially if U.S. policies move away from an EV world, continued cost out of the R1 and increased manufacturing efficiencies are key,” UBS said..UBS maintains a Neutral rating on Rivian, seeing longer-term potential but a tougher near-term landscape..Related articles.Declining EV interest, pricing concerns may limit near-term growth for Rivian: UBS.Southwest Airlines raised at Jefferies after management meetings.Qualcomm-backed study finds Apple’s in-house modem falls short in 5G tests",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-ev-interest-pricing-concerns-143955467.html,Market Risk Company Risk Industry Risk

Its production surged to 57,232 vehicles in 2023 as it overcame those challenges, but it only produced 49,476 vehicles in 2024..That slowdown was caused by higher rates, a cooling EV market, and a temporary shutdown of its main Illinois plant to upgrade its production capabilities..In 2025, it expects to produce just 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles as it faces higher tariffs on its raw materials and batteries, new supply chain disruptions, and another shutdown of its main plant to prepare for the launch of its R2 mid-size SUV in 2026. The January fires in Los Angeles, one of its biggest markets, and potential changes to the federal incentives for EVs could exacerbate that pressure..But despite those formidable challenges, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to rise 5% to $5.24 billion this year as its delivery growth slightly outpaces its production growth..It also expects its gross margin, which turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2024, to stay green this year as it improves its material, conversion, and depreciation costs per vehicle, sells more regulatory credits to other automakers, and expands its higher-margin software and services business.

Sales were still heading higher, and the company had received numerous awards for quality and reception of its R1 vehicles..Since then, however, demand has faltered and sales and deliveries have declined. Below, I'll take a look at the first-quarter decline, what happened, and the silver lining for investors..It's a part of the automotive cycle: As vehicles age, demand wanes. Automakers generally offset this with a mid-cycle refresh, which updates a few things and some design features to freshen up the look and stoke demand..While Rivian did upgrade to a second generation of the R1 vehicles, most of the attention went to hardware and cost reduction. There's also the possibility that demand will continue to wane for its R1 vehicles..The graph above also shows the company exiting 2023 with momentum, before things began to slow. Further, add in the fact that Rivian had a pull-through effect on its EDVs into the fourth quarter, which led to disappointing first-quarter deliveries. In other words, the company built more commercial vehicles during the fourth quarter to catch up from a supply shortage, pulling forward demand from the first quarter..The silver lining with Rivian is clear: Despite slowing deliveries, the company has managed to remove costs and improve its gross profit. The first quarter marked the second-consecutive record quarter for gross profit, generating $206 million. That broke down to $92 million from the automotive segment and $114 from the software and services segment..This is an impressive improvement, considering that lagging deliveries and revenue dropped from $1.1 billion to $922 million during the first quarter. That means the improvement had to have come from the costs side of the equation. Sure enough, Rivian managed to reduce the cost of good sold by a staggering $22,600 per vehicle delivered during the first quarter compared to the prior year..Now, all eyes are turning toward the R2 launch in 2026. Not only will the R2 build on the hardware upgrades to the updated R1, which will lower costs, it also will open the door to a wider consumer base with a price tag starting at around $45,000.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-concerned-rivians-recent-delivery-133000243.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Credit Risk

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) shares have surged over the past month, rising in value by roughly 50%.  The electric vehicle maker is about to experience a huge jump in growth, a surge that could persist for several years.","Shares of the electric vehicle maker have risen 50% in value in 30 days..However, the stock remains a strong buy for patient, long-term investors..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) shares have surged over the past month, rising in value by roughly 50%. But don't think that it's too late to take advantage. The electric vehicle maker is about to experience a huge jump in growth, a surge that could persist for several years..Shares still look like a strong buy for patient investors, but there is one particular risk that every investor must be aware of before diving in..It takes a long time to get a new vehicle from the design stage to production and final delivery. A long time. Rivian was initially founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors. It didn't release its first vehicle, the R1T, until 2021 -- more than a decade later. The R1S, which uses essentially the same platform as the R1T, was released the following year..It's not surprising that it took Rivian this long. Often, new vehicles from new manufacturers like Rivian involve novel design and engineering concepts, especially for electric vehicles. Production facilities, meanwhile, need to be built and scaled up from scratch. And then you have the litany of regulatory and safety hurdles to pass, nonetheless sourcing various parts from potentially dozens of third-party suppliers..Production of the R1T was delayed several times simply due to global chip shortages -- a small but critical component that makes the vehicle possible. And in Rivian's case, you also need to develop the software necessary to not only run the vehicle itself, but also deliver on any promised self-driving capabilities..One of the biggest barriers isn't even about making the car from a physical standpoint, but funding the car from a capital standpoint. It takes billions of dollars to get vehicles like the R1T and R1S to market, not to mention years and years of patient capital. It's hard to find investors willing to fund a company for more than a decade with zero revenue -- a major reason why so many EV start-ups have gone under over the decades..When the R1T and R1S made it to market, Rivian's sales exploded from essentially zero to more than $5 billion. Revenue has stagnated in recent quarters due to a lack of new models..But starting next year, we should see growth surge yet again thanks to the introduction of three new vehicles: the R2, R3, and R3X. All are priced under $50,000, making Rivian's vehicles affordable to millions of new buyers. It will likely still be a year or two until all of these models are in production and on the road, but as we've seen, that's nothing compared to the full timeline involved in bringing new models to market.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-stock-buy-now-140000135.html,"Market Risk,  High Volatility Risk,  Overhyped News Risk,  Overvaluation Risk."

Rivian is dealing with tariff uncertainty, trying to boost deliveries, and constructing the expansion to its Illinois plant to enable production of its all-new R2 SUV. Despite trading well below all-time highs, the stock is quietly up 56% over the past year, but if you need more reason for optimism amid a slowing EV market, here are two..Rivian churned out its first quarter of gross profit during the fourth quarter of 2024, and it expects to generate a modest gross profit for the full-year 2025 period. That said, it still surpassed expectations when it posted a gross profit of $206 million during Q1, compared to $527 million during the prior year..Both automotive and software and services divisions contributed to gross profit. Automotive gross profit checked in at $92 million while software and services checked in at $114 million. Rivian also posted an 85% improvement in cash flow from operating activities during Q1, compared to the prior year..Not only was this is a huge step for Rivian in proving its vision to profitability, it also unlocks a $1 billion payment from Volkswagen Group due to reaching a milestone of two consecutive quarters of gross profit..Furthermore, this is an impressive result because the company's deliveries have slipped, forcing the gross profit improvement to come from minimizing cost of goods sold. Rivian did exactly this, removing over $22,600 in automotive cost of goods sold per vehicle delivered during Q1, compared to the prior year. This makes five consecutive quarters of improving gross margin, as you can see in the graphic below.So far, Rivian has mostly relied on word-of-mouth for its marketing, and while its user base is small, it's very passionate..Rivian is trying to tap into the intense passion of its user base with its newest and first major marketing campaign.

The committee will also explore alternative ways to compensate Musk for past work should Tesla fail to reinstate his record 2018 pay deal via an appeal at the Delaware Supreme Court this year, the report says..WORSE BEFORE BETTER: Morgan Stanley says investors “struggle to justify the value of Tesla as much as ever before” nearly 15 years after the company went public, adding that the firm expects this “valuation ‘problem’ gets worse before it gets better.” Most investors value Tesla’s core auto business at between $50 and $100 per share, then “they put their pens down,” but stopping there is “akin to valuing Amazon (AMZN) as solely an online retailer or Apple (AAPL) as a seller of glowing rectangles and earbuds,” the firm argues. By the mid-2030s, Morgan Stanley forecasts Tesla’s installed base to approach 50M units and estimates that each $100/month of ARPU generated by this installed base for autonomy, charging, connectivity, upgrades, content, used sales, parts/service, and licensing is worth $80 to $100 per share. The energy storage business is Tesla’s “fastest growing and highest margin hardware business at present,” adds that firm, which values Tesla Energy at $67 per share. While Morgan Stanley says it currently does not include a valuation for Tesla Optimus in either its base or bull case, it estimates that every 1% substitution by humanoid of human labor is worth greater than $300B, or around $100 per Tesla share. The firm has an Overweight rating and $410 price target on Tesla, adding that “the majority of the company’s current $1.1tn market cap is based on businesses that have either poor disclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charged-tesla-restart-shipping-chinese-151016276.html,- Supply Chain Risk - Market Risk - Regulatory Risk - Economic Risk

(RIVN) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. RIVN recently experienced a ""golden cross"" event, which saw its 50-day simple moving average breaking out above its 200-day simple moving average..A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts..A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum..A golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon..RIVN has rallied 46.1% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank at the moment. This combination indicates RIVN could be poised for a breakout..The bullish case solidifies once investors consider RIVN's positive earnings outlook. For the current quarter, no earnings estimate has been cut compared to 4 revisions higher in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased too..With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on RIVN for more gains in the near future..Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

82,2025-05-19 18:45:00,Should You Buy Rivian Stock While It's Below $20?,"Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) shares have traded sideways for years, even though there has been plenty of volatility along the way.  Two years ago, Rivian stock traded roughly where the stock trades today, and yet revenue has more than doubled since then.","Shares of the electric vehicle maker last reached $20 in 2023..With a little patience, investors could see a return to that level..But there could be continued volatility in the stock until then..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) shares have traded sideways for years, even though there has been plenty of volatility along the way. Surprisingly, the company's sales have grown tremendously over that time. Two years ago, Rivian stock traded roughly where the stock trades today, and yet revenue has more than doubled since then..In my view, the main issue hasn't been company missteps, but a simple mispricing of the stock by the market. In 2023, shares traded as high as 8 times sales. Today, shares are valued at just 3.2 times sales. So while sales have increased tremendously, the price the market is willing to pay for those sales has dropped in turn, resulting in very little net profit for shareholders..But here's the thing: Rivian is about to experience a huge resurgence in growth, even though shares are priced at a historical discount. This could be a great opportunity now to buy shares for under $20..According to analysts, Rivian is expected to grow sales by just 5.4% in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, around 39% sales growth is expected -- a sizable jump. Why do analysts expect such lackluster growth this year, but then a noticeable spike in growth next year? It all comes down to one factor: new vehicle launches..This year, Rivian's management team is trying to support struggling sales growth through new leasing programs and viral marketing campaigns. Structurally, however, the company simply isn't set up for much growth. It only has two vehicles in its lineup -- the R1S and R1T -- both of which cost between $70,000 and $100,000 depending on options. This high end of the market has never been huge..Just look at Tesla. It has four premium models in its lineup: the Roadster, Model X, Model S, and Cybertruck. Yet out of the nearly 1.8 million cars it sold last year, roughly 1.7 million came from its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles -- both mass market models with affordable starting prices of under $50,000..Put simply: Rivian needs to introduce new models to spur growth, preferably ones that cost under $50,000. Fortunately for investors, that's exactly what management expects to achieve in 2026, when it begins shipping three new affordable models to the public: The R2, R3, and R3X..How much growth could these new affordable models add for Rivian in the long term? Analysts expect 39% sales growth in 2026 thanks to these model introductions. But timelines often get delayed, and the company may begin by shipping just the R2 next year. This means that 2027 and 2028 could result in the biggest growth rates over the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-rivian-stock-while-below-104500039.html,Market Volatility Risk Financial Performance Risk Regulatory Risk  Operational Risk No Credit Risk  High risk

With a market capitalization of just $17 billion, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has a long way to go to reach rival Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) $1 trillion valuation.  Will Rivian ever approach Tesla's gargantuan size?","Tesla is now worth $1 trillion thanks to a step-by-step master plan it conceived..Smaller rival Rivian Automotive aims to follow much the same path to growth..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.With a market capitalization of just $17 billion, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has a long way to go to reach rival Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) $1 trillion valuation. But if the gap is ever closed, shares of the upstart electric vehicle (EV) maker could potentially see huge upside ahead. If all goes well, even a relatively small investment could balloon significantly, helping your portfolio pass the $1 million mark..Will Rivian ever approach Tesla's gargantuan size? There are two reasons to believe such a meteoric rise is possible..Growing your portfolio isn't as simple as buying growth stocks. Often, growth stocks are already priced at a premium. So while sales or profits may grow immensely, the market may have already priced in that growth, resulting in minimal gains for shareholders. Sometimes, a company can grow by leaps and bounds and yet shareholders lose value due to buying in at too steep a premium..Rivian does not face this risk right now. Compared to competitors, its shares trade at a bargain valuation of just 3.1 times sales. Sluggish revenue growth forecasts add credence to this discounted valuation. But there's no denying that the company's stock is a bargain not only compared to the competition but also compared to its trading history..RIVN PS Ratio data by YCharts.The market simply isn't excited about Rivian stock right now. But if you're willing to remain patient, you can lock in today's discounted valuation and wait in the wings for growth rates to reemerge. This is a classic strategy for making huge profits. By buying growth stocks before the market realizes how much growth will occur in the long term, you can benefit from both sides of the coin: a low valuation plus high underlying growth rates..As we'll see, Rivian's growth rates are about to spike. But not within the next 12 months -- the typical time frame for Wall Street growth estimates. Rivian's growth will likely occur over the next 12 to 36 months, giving patient investors a chance to jump in early at today's bargain valuation..In 2006, Tesla laid out its master plan for growth. It involved three phases: Build a sports car, use that money to build an affordable car, and use that money to build an even more affordable car. And that's exactly what Tesla did. It built a sports car, the Tesla Roadster. Then it built more affordable cars like the Model X and Model S. And then it built even more affordable cars like the Model Y and Model 3. Today, the Model 3 and Model Y account for the vast majority of Tesla's sales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-rivian-stock-help-become-131500602.html,Market Risk Company Specific Risk Valuation Risk Investment Risk

J.D. Power executive director of EV practice Brent Gruber joins Asking for a Trend to explain how the new tariffs and potential loss of incentives could hit EV prices and demand..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here..So it sounds like we could be saying goodbye here to that EV tax credit, Brent. If we did, walk us through what you think the ripple effects, the implications would be for EV sales for EV adoption. .Yeah, if that does in fact happen, Josh, you know, you're potentially looking at a double whammy with tariffs and the elimination of the tax credit. You're talking about, you know, what is conceivably a $12,000 plus swing on the price of an electric vehicle. Um, you know, certainly electric vehicle shoppers are price conscious. We've seen some impact on price fluctuations over the last couple years, particularly when there are incentives and pricing actions taken on the sales of electric vehicles. It generates a lot of interest. So if those tax credits go away, you're going to see probably a slow down in the level of interest for electric vehicles. .And how, Brent, would you see that potentially impacting impacting impacting the the automakers? I'm thinking GM and Ford, and just sort of their broader EV ambitions, Brent? .Well, at JD Power, we have this saying that we say, you know, one in, one out, and two in the middle. And what that means is out of every four shoppers in the United States new vehicle shoppers, one of those four is very much interested in an electric vehicle and will highly likely consider purchasing one. And then one of those shoppers is highly likely to not purchase one. Then there's those two in the middle where I think you'll see some movement with those folks in the middle who are maybe on the fence, you know, thinking about purchasing an electric vehicle. You know, there's a market among the consumers who are very set on buying an electric vehicle, but it's really going to affect those people in the middle who may be on the fence. And that's a very large percentage of the buyer population. .Well, I'm also curious, Brent, to get your take on how you think it could impact, if at all, Tesla. I'm curious whether you think Elon Musk is maybe in some sense better positioned there, Brent. Does he have kind of more financial flexibility to lower prices if he had to? .Well, I can tell you from a data perspective and what we see at JD Power, I think that Tesla is very susceptible to the elimination of the tax credits, just as other manufacturers are as well. One of the things that we do with our study is we track the influence of those tax credits on purchase decisions. And when you look at the brands that are most affected by those purchase prices and the tax credit, Tesla's right up there at the top. So I think that they're very susceptible to the elimination of those. Now, whether or not they have some pricing power to be able to offset some of that, I think that remains to be seen. But from a consumer perspective, you know, Tesla consumers are very much utilizing those tax credits.

That said, the most recent quarter, reported in early May, did show some positive signs, particularly with margin improvements thanks to a solid strategy focused on cutting costs.

Rivian doesn’t have a large cash buffer as it once did, and the investment thesis still carries more risk than reward, in my humble opinion. As a result, I’m taking a neutral stance on Rivian Automotive with a Hold rating, for the time being..As a key part of Rivian’s investment thesis, the company aims for long-term relevance and stability by becoming a major player in the global electric vehicle (EV) market, especially in pickups, SUVs, and commercial fleets. Lately, however, Rivian has been hitting some serious headwinds, mostly tied to its struggles in scaling production..Looking closer, Rivian recently reported production of 14,611 vehicles and 8,640 deliveries for the quarter ending in March. While the gap between production and deliveries might raise eyebrows (hinting at either demand issues or logistical hiccups), both numbers came in above the company’s own guidance of 14,000 and 8,000, respectively. Still, deliveries, which are often viewed as a proxy for sales, were down year-over-year from 13,588 in the same quarter of 2024..The broader slowdown isn’t just a Rivian issue—Tesla (TSLA) also posted year-over-year declines—but Rivian’s situation is more urgent. It’s still burning cash and hasn’t reached profitability. Just over a month ago, management reaffirmed its 2025 guidance of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicle deliveries. But things took a turn: during its Q1 earnings release last week, Rivian cut that guidance to 40,000–46,000 for the full year..If the earlier range already suggested stagnation, this revised forecast now points to a step backward. For context, Rivian delivered over 51,500 vehicles in 2024 and 50,122 in 2023. That kind of drop is a red flag for a company that is still heavily dependent on external funding and far from self-sustaining.

Prices are down half a percent in April, but still were up 1 and a half percent from a year ago. Meanwhile, new vehicle prices, they were flat last month, but rose slightly on a year-over-year basis. Here with more we've got Greg Migliore, who is the editorial director at AutoGuide. Greg, just take us into your reaction from the print first and then we'll get into some of the other, uh, of course, major drivers of what's taking place broadly here within the mindset of consumers. .Sure, Brad. Well, thanks for having me. Good to see you. I mean, right now, the car business is still trying to sort out the impact of the tariffs, and I think that was evident in the better than expected CPI numbers and some other numbers you mentioned. We haven't seen a dramatic immediate effect on pricing due to tariffs. Uh, I think there just really wasn't enough time to feel the impact. But we are seeing these tariffs hit in other ways. So we're starting to see fallout as companies like Honda and Nissan are expected to report lower profits. Uh, Ford even specifically called out that its tariff hit is going to be $1.5 billion this year. So, uh, I think we're in kind of a wait-and-see mode right now as far as some of these immediate impacts for consumers. .And so, what is the overall kind of sentiment that we're seeing among consumers who are both hearing from car brands that they are, you know, putting vehicles out on the lot, the non-tariff vehicles on the lot, and then additionally, how consumers are just trying to make sure that they aren't seeing a higher price when they know that from a range of countries and how vehicles are produced in in essence that there could be some pass-through costs that they may incur one day and trying to front run that instead. .Well, I think it's actually pretty confusing for consumers right now. You're thinking yourself, hey, should I rush to the dealership and try to get something before the car I want is actually impacted by tariffs? Should I wait? Are the tariffs going to actually happen this week or this month? So, it's definitely a confusing situation. That being said, it's actually been a pretty good year for car buying. The seasonally adjusted selling rate was over 17 million by a lot of metrics the last couple months, which is a very strong performance for the US auto industry. Uh, you are seeing some companies like Stellantis, for example, offering employee pricing, which is where they, you know, try to make it basically a cheaper, you know, one-cost sort of price, and companies are getting aggressive, which I do think that could benefit consumers. The auto industry is used to operating on a very low margin circumstances for many of their products. They're used to this increased competitiveness. They're used to macroeconomic headwinds. It's all sort of par for the course for the car business. So, in some ways, I think the car world is uniquely positioned to deal with these headwinds. .And so, with that in mind, what about on the used vehicle side? I mean, we we've even heard the strategy from companies that are in the rental space, but also have a used vehicle sales arm, like Hertz. And within their own, uh, within their own recent announcements, talking about a company's cornerstone cell-right strategy, trying to maximize value, improve unit economics, and ultimately leaning into how they can communicate their own value proposition amid some of the tariff-driven pricing dynamics that they're seeing with used car prices rising and and what they essentially label as DPU declining here. How what does that ultimately mean, especially as you hear companies like Hertz talking about their best quarter for retail vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025? And where that's moving consumers to? .Well, I think when you're trying to get yourself a deal, you think used car, right? It's just a natural sort of consumer reaction to price hikes that we think will impact the new car market. Uh, I think it's a frustrating time for consumers on the used car front because you're seeing prices basically higher than ever. I saw a figure that said they were $28,000, that was the average price of a used vehicle, uh, earlier this year, which to me is kind of it's almost an astronomical figure. You wouldn't expect to pay that much money for a used car even if it were something more in the premium space. So again, I think it's a frustrating time for consumers. Uh, but for companies, you know, that do have large fleets that they're trying to offload, I do see great opportunity. You have a chance to get in there, perhaps, you know, cycle through some vehicles you might like to, you know, offload from your general rental fleet or whatnot, uh, move the metal, and make a little bit of money. So I think for companies like Hertz, it's a great time to, you know, frankly, make some money and try to even reach new consumers, remind people that you're out there. And it's it's like many things in this economy. It's not really good for everybody, but for certain segments of it, you know, there's really some spotlight opportunity. .So, how is that influencing the summer outlook then for car buying? .So, I think this summer is going to actually be a decent time to buy a car. I think the summer buying season for the car industry, you get into like Memorial Day, then right through Labor Day. People are going to dealerships. That's usually a time, it's nice out. People are interested in into getting something new and setting themselves up for, you know, the rest of the year, school year, you know, the winter. It's human nature, right? So, generally you see decent foot traffic and companies are pretty aggressive. Uh, I saw that the average, um, you know, incentive was over $3,000 last month, which is actually a pretty hefty amount of cash on the hood for vehicles. Credit is still reasonably available. It's not quite as good as it was, but for most people, it's out there. You could use it to finance your new vehicle purchase. We're seeing longer and longer car loans in excess of 72 months because people know that, hey, you can maybe spread out that payment over time. Is that the best financial decision? Probably not, but it helps you get into a new vehicle. So, I actually think this summer is going to be a decent time to buy a car. .All right, Greg. We're going to be watching closely. Maybe I'll go kick the tires somewhere, maybe. Appreciate the time. .Thank you.

92,2025-05-14 00:00:00,Rivian Automotive (RIVN) Is Up 3.11% in One Week: What You Should Know,Does Rivian Automotive (RIVN) have what it takes to be a top stock pick for momentum investors? Let's find out.,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades..While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us..Below, we take a look at Rivian Automotive (RIVN), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions..It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Rivian Automotive currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period..You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>.In order to see if RIVN is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this a manufacturer of motor vehicles and passenger cars holds up..A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area..For RIVN, shares are up 3.11% over the past week while the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.7% compares favorably with the industry's 7.78% performance as well..Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Rivian Automotive have increased 4.35% over the past quarter, and have gained 34.31% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -3.09% and 13.39%, respectively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-rivn-3-11-160008508.html,Market Risk: High

Additionally, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” have been halted due to other companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks, including a company that has applied for numerous trademarks related to aftermarket Cybertruck accessories, O’Kane writes. Tesla has three months to file a response to the USPTO or the office will abandon the application, according to the report..TESLA FSD: Piper Sandler keeps an Overweight rating on Tesla with a $400 price target after hosting an investor call with Elias Martinez, creator of the FSD Community Tracker. Tesla’s full self-driving software is the largest contributor to Piper’s price target, the firm tells investors in a research note. After the call, Piper says it seems evident that Tesla’s current version 13 of its full self-driving software cannot support truly autonomous vehicles. However, it has been 4.5 months since Tesla unveiled version 13, and since then, no major updates have been released, the firm points out.

It's challenging to produce vehicles, let alone make high-quality ones that are well-received by critics and consumers alike -- and Rivian has achieved that goal. 2025 was setting up to be a quiet year, with its next vehicle launch, the highly anticipated R2, not until 2026. But don't tell Rivian it's supposed to be a quiet year, as the company is attempting to spark lackluster sales in two ways..Come one, come all, Rivian is seemingly yelling at potential consumers as the company is bringing in spring with a new offer designed to boost sales. Through May, consumers can lease any Rivian R1 dual-motor electric vehicle (EV) with a Max battery and performance upgrade for $0 down..Rivian announced the ""Nothing But Adventure"" lease offer program, noting that it would cover your lease down payment with a $6,500 offer. Even better, consumers can also pair this savings with the usual $7,500 EV credit that is written into each lease. This is a move often seen when demand wanes, but it could be just the move Rivian needs right now to boost sales that have been lackluster in recent quarters..But its leasing offer isn't the only way Rivian is attempting to spark sales, and its second move will also build brand awareness..Investors know that Rivian's R1 vehicles have been a hit with consumers and critics, but what investors might not know is just how much consumers are invested in their Rivians. There are independently run Rivian Clubs of America spanning 35 states, which often include trips and other gatherings..Rivian is attempting to tap into this unique brand passion with its first major marketing campaign. The campaign, named ""Real Rivian Adventures,"" will use actual stories from real Rivian consumers and turn them into advertisements..One example is the ""Last Lemonade Standing,"" inspired by an owner's Facebook post. The ad situates a neighborhood boy using a Rivian vehicle outlet, in a feature unique to some EVs, to blend lemonade slushies to compete against another stand. The paid media plan will include spots on streaming services and social media, with possible buys on broadcast TV, per Rivian's vice president of marketing, Denise Cherry.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/maybe-2025-wont-quiet-rivian-140000260.html,- Credit risk - Market risk - Operational risk

The market’s tepid reaction reflects concerns about the company’s adjusted guidance and broader industry challenges..I am bullish on the stock over the long term, but caution that this one will require significant patience and intestinal fortitude, and is not for those who aren’t up for a long car trip along a bumpy (but scenic) highway..Rivian reported a $22,600 year-over-year cost reduction per vehicle in Q1 2025, a significant improvement in manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies. Meanwhile, revenue from software and services surged 258% to $318 million. The combination of these is resulting in a growing high-margin business segment..Strategic partnerships are also important in Rivian’s growth. Volkswagen’s investment is a significant milestone, and Rivian continues to benefit from a $6.6 billion U.S. Department of Energy loan to support its manufacturing expansion plans..Despite this progress, the company still faces supply chain vulnerabilities (especially for battery materials and semiconductors), substantial cash burn (with negative free cash flow exceeding $5 billion over the past year), competition from both established automakers and other EV startups, and risks related to scaling production and launching new models..The company’s planned one-month production halt later this year for retooling its Illinois facility to prepare for the R2 model launch will temporarily impact output, but it is necessary for long-term growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-stock-rivn-goes-103931358.html,1.

Let’s take a look at how automobile manufacturing stocks fared in Q1, starting with General Motors (NYSE:GM).","The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how automobile manufacturing stocks fared in Q1, starting with General Motors (NYSE:GM)..Much capital investment and technical know-how are needed to manufacture functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing automobiles for the mass market. Barriers to entry are therefore high, and auto manufacturers with economies of scale can boast strong economic moats. However, this doesn’t insulate them from new entrants, as electric vehicles (EVs) have entered the market and are upending it. This has forced established manufacturers to not only contend with emerging EV-first competitors but also decide how much they want to invest in these disruptive technologies, which will likely cannibalize their legacy offerings..The 6 automobile manufacturing stocks we track reported a strong Q1.

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) is one that is still kicking. Along with Tesla, it is one of the only pure-play electric vehicle (EV) companies left producing cars for customers as competition intensifies and industry growth subsides..The company is still in the very early stages, but has big plans for its product pipeline and investments in the coming years. As of this writing, the stock trades below $15, which is down over 90% from all-time highs set back at its initial public offering. At such a discounted price, is now the time to invest in EV disrupter Rivian Automotive? Let's dig into its Q1 earnings and investigate further..With demand for EVs slowing to a crawl in 2025, Rivian's deliveries to customers have hit a wall. Its R1 truck costs $70,000-$100,000 for individuals to purchase, making it too expensive for most shoppers in the United States. Deliveries were just 8,640 last quarter, which is a fraction of the deliveries for industry leaders such as Tesla. This figure is moving in the wrong direction, with deliveries of over 13,000 in the first quarter a year ago..However, Rivian is making progress to improve its unit economics and free-cash burn. Its gross margin hit a positive 17% in Q1, a record for the company. This came because of increasing revenue from software and services to $318 million compared to $88 million a year ago, along with payments from its joint venture with Volkswagen. Free cash flow over the last 12 months was negative $1.8 billion, an improvement from a few years ago..With $7 billion in cash on the balance sheet and billions of dollars in promised funding from partners like Volkswagen along with the United States government, Rivian Automotive has plenty of years left to try to get to positive free cash flow. In order to do so, it will need to start growing its deliveries again to get to scale. How does it plan to do that? With a cheaper EV model..The R2 is an SUV that Rivian is planning to release in 2026, with factory production getting built right now. It will cost around $45,000-$50,000, significantly decreasing the price point compared to the R1.

That milestone unlocked an added $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen, which is part of its $5.8 billion overall potential investment..With the electric vehicle (EV) maker starting to get on a roll, let's see if investors should buy the stock before it reaches its next big milestone..After years of negative gross margins, Rivian appears to have turned the corner with its second straight quarter of positive gross margins. Perhaps even more impressive was that the company's gross margins came in above those of its larger rival Tesla in the first quarter..For the quarter, Rivian's gross margin was 16.6% compared to 16.3% for Tesla. It's a monumental shift from just a year ago, when Rivian had a negative gross margin of 44% compared to a positive gross margin of 17.4% for Tesla..The company did a lot of work over the past year revamping its SUV's internal design, input costs, and manufacturing to help reach this gross margin milestone. Meanwhile, its new zonal architecture not only allowed it to significantly reduce costs, but was also a driving factor behind its joint-venture investment from Volkswagen..The company is now looking to lean more into its higher-margin software. With the launch of its second-generation Rivian Autonomy platform, it recently added a hands-free driving feature for highways (which still requires the driver's attention) and is focused on quickly introducing self-driving that is more autonomous..Its biggest focus, though, is preparing for the launch of its lower-priced R2 SUV in the first half of next year. The company's R1 remains one of the best-selling luxury electric SUVs in the U.S., particularly in California. But its high price tag limits its overall market..That is where the R2 comes in. With a price tag projected to be around $45,000, the new SUV is expected to have much wider appeal. In the second half of the year, the company will shut down its factory for about a month to retool to prepare for the R2's launch in the first half of 2026. This should be the next big milestone for the company, and could be the potential trigger for Volkswagen's next $1 billion investment to kick in.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-buy-stock-next-big-123000763.html,Market Risk  Operational Risk
101,2025-05-11 06:05:00,"If Tesla Is Only Selling This Many Trucks, How Much Growth Is There for Rivian?","Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2024.  The vast majority of the EVs Tesla sold were sedans and SUVs.  If Tesla is having trouble selling the electric trucks it makes, could Rivian's focus on trucks be a stumbling block?","Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2024..The vast majority of the EVs Tesla sold were sedans and SUVs..If Tesla is having trouble selling the electric trucks it makes, could Rivian's focus on trucks be a stumbling block?.10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) effectively created the electric vehicle market, proving to the legacy automakers that they needed to view the technology as a legitimate business threat. Every EV company is compared to Tesla, which has gone from an upstart business to a sustainably profitable and sizable automaker. This is where the new Cybertruck and EV truck maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) intersect..Tesla makes electric vehicles, from sedans to trucks. It also does a number of other high-tech things (like robotics and clean energy), so it isn't exactly a pure-play auto stock. However, that doesn't change the fact that it has a sizable auto business. In 2024, Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million EVs across all of its vehicle platforms..There are a number of different models in the mix. Right now, it lumps the Model 3 and Model Y into one group. These are sedans and SUVs, respectively. These two models accounted for around 95% of the company's total vehicle sales. The remaining 5% of sales gets lumped into the ""other"" category. That includes the Cybertruck, which saw its first deliveries in late 2023..Even if every single one of the ""other"" vehicles Tesla sold in 2024 was a Cybertruck, it only managed to sell around 85,000 of the vehicles. And, notably, the volume of ""other"" vehicle sales fell by nearly 50% between the fourth quarter of 2024 (23,640 vehicles) and the first quarter of 2025 (12,881). That's not a good sign for Tesla's truck offering, though the current drop in sales is likely being swayed by CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration..Rivian only makes and sells EV trucks. To be fair, it makes trucks for the consumer market and for the commercial market, so it has multiple sales channels. That said, the automaker spent 2023 ramping up its production to around 50,000 vehicles a year. In 2024, it refocused around profitability, managing to achieve a modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of the year. It is making very good progress as a business..Still, Rivian's production of 50,000 EV trucks is fairly close to the size of Tesla's ""other"" category, which includes its Cybertruck model. In fact, in the first quarter of 2025, Rivian sold around 8,000 trucks, which is about 60% of the number of ""other"" vehicles sold by Tesla. If you go back to the run rate of the fourth quarter of 2025, before political issues may have impacted Tesla vehicle sales, Rivian's first-quarter production would have been closer to a third of Tesla's ""other"" sales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-only-selling-many-trucks-220500369.html,1.

Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has emerged as one of the most promising U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) companies over the past several years.,"President Trump's tariffs are weighing on automakers..Rivian cut its vehicle-deliveries forecast amid the uncertainty..Rivan has lots of promise, but it's probably best to wait before buying shares..10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›.Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has emerged as one of the most promising U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) companies over the past several years. The company's brand scores the highest among all car brands in terms of owner satisfaction; it reached an important milestone of gross profitability in the past two consecutive quarters; and it has exciting new models in its pipeline..But the Trump administration's tariffs are throwing a wrench into many automakers' plans, and Rivian isn't immune. Here's how the company is handling the current auto tariffs and whether or not Rivian stock is a buy right now..Rivian, like every other automaker, sources some parts from outside the country, and tariffs are already increasing the company's capital expenditures (capex) and weighing down its vehicle production..Rivan's management lowered its vehicle-delivery guidance for the full year to a range of between 40,000 to 46,000, down from its previous guidance of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles. The company said in its first-quarter shareholder letter that its guidance reflects the ""evolving"" trade regulations and tariffs..The downward revision means that Rivian will deliver fewer vehicles in 2025 than it did in each of the previous two years. Making matters worse for Rivian is an uptick in costs because of tariffs. The company raised its capex guidance for the year to a range between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion -- up from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion -- because of ""the expected impact from tariffs."".Rivian CFO Claire McDonough said on the earnings call that the company's expenses will increase by a ""couple thousand dollars"" per vehicle because of tariffs..It's worth noting that Rivian is an American automaker, making its vehicles 100% in the United States. CEO RJ Scaringe also said recently in a Fox Business interview that his company has a ""very U.S.-centric supply chain."" And yet, the tariff impact is significant for the company..Rivan mentioned the potential for a negative impact on the economy due to tariffs a few times in its shareholder letter, saying:.The current global economic landscape presents significant uncertainty, particularly regarding evolving trade regulation, policies, tariffs, and the overall impact these items may have on consumer sentiment and demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-stock-buy-amid-president-183200295.html,Market Volatility Currency Risk Regulatory Risk Geopolitical Risk Industry Risk
103,2025-05-09 21:47:00,Slate CEO: We've raised nearly $700M from backers like Bezos for US-built EVs,EV startup Slate announced the company isn’t done raising funds.,"Electric vehicle startup Slate announced that the company isn’t done raising funds. Slate, which counts backers like Jeff Bezos and Guggenheim's Mark Walter as investors, has closed out its Series A and Series B funding and is now looking at a Series C. Prior to Thursday’s announcement, the company had reportedly raised around $110 million..“We've gone through a couple rounds of funding,” Slate CEO Chris Barman said to Yahoo Finance. “So Jeff Bezos was our lead in our first round, the Walter Group in our second round. We also have General Catalyst as an investor. And we've raised nearly $700 million.”.That whopping figure hadn't been reported before. But when it comes to building an auto business from scratch, it's possible billions will be needed..But with no stamping operation needed (the company will use pre-fabricated composite parts for the body) nor a paint shop (all the composite parts are already slate gray), Barman believes it can accomplish its goals with less capital..The company announced it would house its assembly facility at the former LSC Communications printing plant in Warsaw, Ind., and aims to reach its 150,000-unit run rate by late 2027. Slate has said cars will be on the road starting in late 2026..Slate said it will be cash flow positive shortly after production, a tough ask when competitors like Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are barely gross profit positive..Building in America means tariffs won’t be an issue, and the company believes it can keep its supply chain in the US as well..“We were very focused through the process that we wanted to also source American parts,” Barman said. “So we have a high number of US-sourced parts within the vehicle, so we'll be very insulated against that.”.Slate said previously that its EV pickup, a bare-bones truck with a footprint smaller than a Ford (F) Maverick, will cost somewhere in the mid-$20,000 range and will come in only one color, slate gray..The EV offers two options on the choice of two battery sizes for the rear-wheel-drive truck: a 52.7-kWh battery pack targeting 150 miles of range and an 84.3-kWh pack with 240 miles of range..Slate’s other appeal is to DIYers, who can add a massive number of custom parts, vinyl skins, and even a roof to make it an SUV and install them on their own..Buyers can also choose to do none of these things and have a cheap, utilitarian pickup..Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

104,2025-05-09 18:54:00,"Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) Just Reported First-Quarter Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?","Rivian Automotive, Inc. ( NASDAQ:RIVN ) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers...","Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. The results were impressive, with revenues of US$1.2b exceeding analyst forecasts by 22%, and statutory losses of US$0.48 were likewise much smaller than the analysts had forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Rivian Automotive after the latest results..Our free stock report includes 2 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Rivian Automotive. Read for free now..Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Rivian Automotive from 26 analysts is for revenues of US$5.24b in 2025. If met, it would imply a credible 4.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Losses are supposed to decline, shrinking 15% from last year to US$2.84. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$5.37b and losses of US$3.48 per share in 2025. Although the revenue estimates have fallen somewhat, Rivian Automotive'sfuture looks a little different to the past, with a favorable reduction in the loss per share forecasts in particular.. See our latest analysis for Rivian Automotive .There was no major change to the US$14.06average price target, suggesting that the adjustments to revenue and earnings are not expected to have a long-term impact on the business. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Rivian Automotive analyst has a price target of US$23.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$6.10. So we wouldn't be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case, because there are clearly some widely different views on what kind of performance this business can generate. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business..Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that Rivian Automotive's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 6.2% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 57% p.a. growth over the last three years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 15% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Rivian Automotive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-inc-nasdaq-rivn-105429822.html,Market Risk Financial Risk Operational Risk

Because Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) certainly have. And if you're an investor in either of these two leading electric vehicle (EV) stocks, you should definitely be keeping an eye on Slate..And if you have not heard about Slate yet, here's what you need to know..First and foremost, you need to know that the threat Slate poses to Tesla and Rivian is of the not-quite-yet variety. Although backed by multiple well-heeled financiers, billionaire Jeff Bezos among them, Slate is an electric car company still firmly in start-up mode. Media reports indicate (but Slate is not yet confirming), that Slate EV truck deliveries probably won't begin before the final quarter of 2026. That said, pre-orders of Slate trucks, secured by a refundable $50 deposit, began last week..It's likely they've already begun to affect sales of Tesla Cybertrucks and Rivian R1T and R1S vehicles..Slate describes its new electric truck as ""the most radically simple, wildly personalizable vehicle out there,"" designed in California and assembled in Michigan (or perhaps Indiana -- here's some confusion on this point). At its basest level, Slate is a tiny two-door RWD pickup. It's roughly the size of an early 2000s-era standard cab Ford Ranger, but two feet shorter in length than a modern Ford Maverick hybrid pickup, for example, and much smaller than Tesla's or Rivian's trucks..Slate is building interest in the new vehicle by advertising it at ""an expected price of under $20,000 after federal incentives,"" which implies a base price of perhaps $27,000, minus a federal tax credit of $7,500 for U.S.-built electric vehicles..Compare that to Cybertruck's $69,990 entry price, the $71,700 a base Rivian R1T will cost you, or the $77,700 MSRP on a Rivian R1S, and you can see right away why Slate is attracting interest, and probably stealing away market share from its rivals..Of course, all of the above are advertised base model prices. Start adding options, and each of the EVs named above skyrockets in cost. (Cybertruck, for example, is described as the best-selling vehicle in America, ""priced above $100,000,"" which tells you few shoppers are finding Cybertrucks for under $70,000.) And Slate already has ""nearly four dozen accessories"" available for add-on.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-just-built-slate-electric-110700460.html,1. Market risk 2. Competition risk 3.

As per Wards Intelligence, new car sales in the United States hit 15.9 million in 2024, up 2.2% from 2023 and the highest since 2019..In 2025, S&P Global forecasts that global sales of new light vehicles, or passenger cars and trucks, are projected to rise 1.7% to 89.6 million units. The overall reduction of 2025 automotive estimates reflects anticipated changes in US policy following the election. There will be significant impacts on the demand for vehicles as a result, particularly on interest rates, trade flows, sourcing, and the rates of BEV adoption..Colin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, commented:.“2025 is shaping up to be ultra-challenging for the auto industry, as key regional demand factors limit demand potential and the new US administration adds fresh uncertainty from day one,” “A key concern is how ‘natural’ EV demand fares as governments rethink policy support, especially incentives and subsidies, industrial policy, tariffs, and fast evolving OEM target setting.”.Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility, recently stated that consumers who are considering buying a new car are hurrying to dealers before possible price implications become apparent. The sales spikes in March and April might open the way for future volatility. In the next three months, automakers will face new, tariffed inventory and production levels in addition to unstable economic conditions..In response to industry criticism, President Trump recently introduced a two-year relief provision linked to domestic sales and manufacturing volume, which loosened the recently imposed 25% tariffs on cars and parts. Now, automakers with U.S. factories can deduct import taxes on parts, starting at 3.75% of the suggested retail price of a car in the first year, and then 2.5% in the second year. Vehicles with 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican parts are exempt from tariffs, which will rise to 90% by next year. Furthermore, the administration exempted these companies from overlapping taxes on Canadian and Mexican commodities, steel, and aluminum. After industry groups warned that the duties, which went into effect in March for automobiles and on May 3 for parts, would increase auto prices, lower sales, and negatively impact service costs, the move was made.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-inc-rivn-among-151359852.html,Market Risk Investment Risk Company Risk

While Trump has used tariffs as bargaining chips and to influence foreign policy, the auto industry has been concerned that it could see raised prices, reduced sales, and less profit..For Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) investors, there's a little bit of good news on the tariff front and with one strategy it used to offset some of the tariff headwinds..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».The first bit of good news for Rivian investors is the Trump administration's tariff relief. Currently, there's a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, and a 25% tariff on vehicle parts that began on May 3..A couple of executive orders are expected to provide some relief for the automotive industry. Essentially, for a vehicle with 50% imported parts, the automaker would only have to pay tariffs on 35% of the vehicle for the first year. The rebate is then lowered in year two and then phased out. That means that a vehicle with 85% domestic parts will avoid tariffs during the first year – it should be noted 85% is a high percentage of domestic parts..A separate executive order noted that automakers would pay only up to a 25% tariff on a vehicle and its parts, and would not have to pay additional import taxes on aluminum and steel used in the vehicle, or because it was imported from Canada or Mexico..While the relief is welcomed, not everyone thinks it's hugely helpful. One such person is Dan Ives, managing director of autos at Wedbush Securities, according to the Detroit Free Press: ""It's akin to having a car accident and saying, 'Oh good, it's not totaled, but it's still $20,000 worth of damage.'"".In a strategic move, Rivian quietly began building a reserve of electric vehicle (EV) batteries from Asia ahead of the Trump administration's tariffs. The small gamble is paying off and gives the company a little insurance against the tariff pressure being applied on the entire automotive supply chain..Rivian even acquired a supply of lithium-iron phosphate cells from China's Gotion High-Tech Co. before the U.S. election and more recently worked with cell supplier Samsung SDI to move a substantial amount of battery inventory to the U.S. from South Korea.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/little-good-news-rivian-investors-111500978.html,- Market Risk  - Company-specific Risk  - Regulatory Risk  - Supply Chain Risk

This is particularly key when you consider that just last week Samsung SDI said a tariff war would make it more expensive to produce electric vehicles..Ultimately, says Carscoops, Rivian has bought itself more than just inventory; it’s bought “breathing room before it has to worry about raising prices.”.Speaking of raising prices, current plans from automakers appear to be all across the board.

The company apparently began setting aside extra battery material from China-based Gotion High-Tech in an effort to soften some of the impact of Trump's tariffs..Rivian investors were understandably excited to learn that the company made a bold move to somewhat insulate itself from import tariffs. It's still unclear just how much it will save by making the pre-emptive move, but with Chinese import tariffs currently as high as 145%, it could be significant..Rivian investors were also likely responding to the Trump administration's pullback on some auto tariffs this week. The administration said some auto-parts import tariffs will no longer stack on top of each other; for example, an automaker may not have to pay a steel tariff and aluminum tariff on the same part..Rivian produces its vehicles at its Normal, Illinois, plant but it sources parts from U.S. and foreign suppliers. Any move, then, by the administration to reduce tariffs on auto part imports could potentially help Rivian..Investors are right to be pleased with Rivian's proactive battery sourcing, but it's also important to note that the auto industry is facing a very difficult environment..There are still a lot of unknowns for automakers right now, and many companies, including General Motors and Stellantis, recently cut their guidance due to tariffs. If President Trump's tariffs cause a slowdown in the economy, consumer spending could drop significantly. And if Rivian is affected by some tariffs in the near future, its vehicle prices could still increase.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-rivan-stock-jumped-week-200248956.html,- Supply Chain Risk - Market Volatility Risk - Regulatory Risk

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this a manufacturer of motor vehicles and passenger cars have returned +9.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.7% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Rivian Automotive belongs, has gained 6.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Rivian Automotive is expected to post a loss of $0.80 per share, indicating a change of +32.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of -$2.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.12 indicates a change of +26.2% from what Rivian Automotive is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Rivian Automotive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-inc-rivn-trending-130011640.html,Market Risk

This model came in several variants, but all essentially came down to a luxury electric sedan priced between $70,000 and $250,000, depending on options. The Air was an impressive initial vehicle for Lucid, helping grow the company's sales to nearly $1 billion. But the Lucid Air had severe limitations. Its high cost priced out most of the market, while its sedan form factor deterred anyone looking for something roomier, like an SUV..Earlier this year, Lucid solved half of that challenge with the launch of its Gravity SUV platform -- essentially doubling its lineup. Analysts expect sales to grow by 82% this year, and another 91% next year, due to demand for Lucid's SUV platform. But with a start price of nearly $100,000, the Gravity still prevents Lucid from tapping the mass market. That could all change in 2026, however, when the company expects to launch several new vehicles, all priced under $50,000..There's a lot of risk to this story.

Um I can imagine that they're happy about, but this particular break is again just on um the vehicles, the parts that are going into vehicles, just keep in mind that there has been no mention about vehicle parts that are coming into the country that would perhaps be for those that need to repair their vehicles. All of those parts still being imported would be theoretically hit with the full 25%, and that of course will matter to anyone who owns used vehicles or has a car that they might need to get repaired sometime soon. And then furthermore, there was some talk around not stacking. Well, theoretically, a car that's coming in fully assembled may not have been subjected to the stacking tariff of steel steel and aluminum either ways, you know, so there's not really a whole lot to give there either. So, it's a little bit confusing. I'm anxious to see how the president actually um fills out some of the holes that we have right now. Uh we expect him to do that around 6:00 tonight, but it's not overwhelming me with a lot of great news from a bottom line perspective. .If I'm if I'm running one of these car companies here, I'm running GM, I'm running Ford, bottom line, am I bringing back more manufacturing here to the States? Because that of course is Trump's goal here, right? That's what he wants. .Yeah, I mean, you know, we've said all along every automaker has been heavily invested in the United States, and we expect that there are going to be more investments in the country. It's one of the largest automotive markets in the world. Um and we do anticipate that assembly might be more possible quicker. Um building up our parts supply chain here in the United States, that's a little tougher um to imagine that we would be able to reshore as many parts of manufacturing that could really offset this whole tariff um imposition here. But should I expect to see more assembly coming into the United States? Sure. Um will it be again enough to really offset what the goals of the president really hopes to, you know, attempt by this?

The journal report about how we're going to get possibly two stages of relief here for automakers. They were desperately seeking some relief here from, you know, 25% uh import tariffs, right? So, basically, uh the first part is the the White House doesn't want to de- doesn't want they want to destack some of these tariffs, right? They don't want to have automakers pay 25% import tariffs as well as um your your steel and aluminum tariffs or China fentanyl tariffs. What they're going to do is they're going to say, ""You're going to pay one of one of these, the highest one. That'll be your only tariff there. You're not going to stack them on top of each other."" Uh which something that will be helpful for automakers that are importing. Uh but also, more importantly, there's going to be an auto parts exemption here. So, they're kind of they're going to stage this in uh in two two ways. So, basically, in the first year, uh you get up to an amount of 3.75% of the value of the car, uh based on the the imported parts you're bringing in. You're going to get that as as an offset. Uh the formula kind of works out in such a way that they figured out that 15% of the parts coming in for cars made in the U.S., they just can't be replaced or onshored here. So, they're going to give you that money back. It's a complicated equation. Basically, it's 15% * 25% tariff gets you to 3.75%. That's going to be backed out of the price of the car. It's going to give me an offset for tariffs. I know it's really complicated, but that's just sort of uh where we are right now. And that's going to give uh American companies some time to onshore some of the stuff in two years, that'll that'll go away. And that's sort of where we are with the tariffs. A little bit of relief here, but still very complicated and still nowhere near where we were before the whole tariff situation started. .So, Pras, you know, bottom line, if I was a CEO, uh I was running one of these auto companies, how do you think those CEOs are feeling today? I mean, is it is it a a big sigh of relief? Is it more, ""Well, you know, I'll I'll I'll take any relief I can get.""? What do you think they're thinking of? .Uh that's a good point. I think it's a mixture of, ""I'll take whatever relief I can get,"" and also and also some genuine relief. I mean, Ford, uh CEO Jim Farley said this this is good news.

Meanwhile, tariffs will apply to foreign car makers building cars in the US. The manufacturers will get a 15% offset for the value of those vehicles against parts imports, according to Secretary Luttnik. Tariff relief will be phased in over three years to allow automakers to produce supply chains in the US.

151,2025-04-29 22:01:00,Will Rivian Automotive (RIVN) Report Negative Earnings Next Week? What You Should Know,Rivian Automotive (RIVN) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,"The market expects Rivian Automotive (RIVN) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates..The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 6, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise..This a manufacturer of motor vehicles and passenger cars is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.8%..Revenues are expected to be $1.03 billion, down 14.8% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.85% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-rivn-report-negative-140131581.html,Market Volatility Investment Risk Earnings Risk

Here with the details, we've got senior autos reporter, Pras Subramanian. Pras, what are we expecting here? .Hey, Brad. So, you know, long time coming here of relief for the auto sector. Uh, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed by Howard Letnick last night, and Karine Jean-Pierre saying today that something's coming. But we don't have the details yet. The journal claimed that there are some, uh, little few features here. So first and foremost, uh, they want to prevent, uh, tariffs on foreign-made cars stacking up on top of other tariffs as currently imposed. So it means the automakers paying Trump's auto tariffs won't actually be charged for other duties, like uh, steel and aluminum tariffs that are currently existing. Uh, and that, and that move would be retroactive to April 2nd when the tariffs began, meaning that automakers would get reimbursed for some of that, uh, tariff expense. Uh, secondly, on auto parts which would be coming on May 3rd, uh, they'd also be reimbursed up to, up to an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a US-made car for one year, then 2.5% the year after that before being phased out. So getting a little bit of relief there, uh, from the auto parts, uh, portion as well. A lot going on here. So, uh, we don't, we're still kind of working on the details, but the automakers will take it, right? So, uh, Ford CEO, Jim Farley, put out a statement, uh, claiming that Ford welcomes and appreciates these decisions by President Trump, which will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers, and consumers. So more to come here later today on some of these auto part tariff or auto exemptions potentially on tariffs. .Pras, thanks so much. .Thank you.

Right now, Wall Street experts expect the company to nearly double sales in 2025..This could be your opportunity to buy into a high-growth stock at a discount. But if you're really looking for big growth potential, pay attention to Lucid's growth prospects starting in 2026..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Lucid stock is down 17% so far in 2025, and shares are trading at just 7.4 times trailing sales. That's a discount to competitors like Tesla, but a premium to other EV makers like Rivian. Lucid's relative premium to Rivian makes a lot of sense. The recent introduction of Lucid's Gravity SUV platform is expected to help sales nearly double this year. Rivian, meanwhile, isn't expected to release any new models this year..Thanks to this expected sales growth, Lucid stock trades at just 5 times forward sales. But looking even further ahead, there's reason to believe that Lucid will hit another sales inflection point in 2026 due to one major event..Last year, it was revealed that Lucid expects to begin production on three new more affordable models, all of which should cost under $50,000. At the time, this timeline seemed aggressive, especially considering its Gravity SUV had yet to be released. Last week, however, Derek Jenkins, a senior vice president at Lucid, confirmed that the company is currently ""on track"" to begin production of an affordable SUV model in 2026, though he noted that there are ""a lot of crazy things going on in the world that can affect that [timeline]."".This new Lucid model is expected to compete with Tesla's existing Model Y and Rivian's anticipated R2 midsize SUV. If the company's timeline remains intact, it could see another huge spike in sales growth next year..Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

To be fair, however, the stock was relatively overvalued at the time. And some investors may be looking at its now much cheaper valuation as an opportunity..The next 12 months will present significant opportunities for Rivian as it rolls out its new R2 SUV and R3 crossover models. The arrival of those lower-priced mass-market EVs will expand its ability to capture some market share from embattled EV powerhouse Tesla. But will the company ever be able to staunch its relentless outflows of cash? .Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».2025 has been a tumultuous year for the automotive industry and the U.S. economy as a whole. So far, one of the biggest losers has been Tesla, which saw its first-quarter deliveries drop 13% year over year, due in large part to backlash against the actions of CEO Elon Musk in Washington. Rivian can capitalize on Tesla's damaged brand to win over consumers who still want to buy an electric vehicle, but don't want to put money in Musk's pocket. .Rivian may also benefit from the 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imports imposed by President Donald Trump, as well as his wider tariff platform. The EV maker boasts a highly U.S.-centric supply chain -- its motors and batteries are built domestically, and all its vehicles are assembled in Normal, Illinois. This gives the company an advantage over rivals like Ford Motor, which manufactures the electric Mustang Mach-E crossover in Mexico..That said, Rivian won't be entirely immune to tariff-related fallout. Like all automakers, it relies on a complex international supply chain for sourcing electronic components and core materials such as steel and aluminum, which now face significantly higher import taxes. This could erode gross margins across the U.S. auto industry. And as a small and still unprofitable company, Rivian will be less able to absorb those higher costs than its larger rivals. .Rivian's fourth-quarter results were a mixed bag. The good news was that total revenue jumped 32% year over year to $1.73 billion, driven by a spike in sales. Its operating losses dropped 58% to $661 million. While that was still a massive loss for a company of Rivian's size, things are moving in the right direction, and it now has a pathway to profitability and positive cash flow if it can continue scaling up its business model while keeping costs under control.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-rivian-stock-1-142300908.html,Market Volatility Risk Market Share Risk Competition Risk Investment Risk Operational Risk

To understand Rivian's valuation today, it's important to first understand where the company is in its long-term growth journey.  As with many EV makers, Rivian's first models were luxury vehicles with high price points.","Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) is expected to report earnings on May 6. So far this year, shares of the EV maker have been weak, falling by more than 10%. Yet growth estimates are starting to pick up, and shares trade near their cheapest levels in years..If you're looking to buy a high-potential electric car stock on the cheap, this looks like your chance..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».To understand Rivian's valuation today, it's important to first understand where the company is in its long-term growth journey. As with many EV makers, Rivian's first models were luxury vehicles with high price points. Both the R1S and R1T -- Rivian's only models on the market right now -- can cost upwards of $100,000 depending on options. These high-end models allowed the company to scale up its manufacturing base and establish a reputation for quality. Last year, for instance, Consumer Reports named Rivian its top choice among a survey of car owners. Rivian was the only car manufacturer of any kind, both electric and conventional, to achieve a perfect five out of five rating for customer satisfaction..But Rivian's growth journey won't end with two high-priced luxury models. Three new models are in the works -- the R2, R3, and R3X -- all of which are expected to debut under $50,000. These vehicles will be targeting a broader customer base, with entry prices far more affordable than previous models. The R2 is expected to debut first, with production slated for sometime in 2026. ""R2 is going to really open up the market for us,"" Rivian's CEO commented in February..As you can see below, Rivian shares trade at a deep discount to competitors like Tesla and Lucid Group. Why? Because Rivian's sales growth over the next few quarters is expected to be tepid or even negative. That's because the company's biggest growth driver -- the introduction of new affordable vehicles -- won't occur until at least 12 months from now, beyond the scope of most analyst growth projections..All of this adds up to a compelling case for buying Rivian shares before earnings arrive next month. Put simply, investors are locking in a great price before any additional news surrounding its mass-market vehicle launch arrives. As we get closer to the launch, Rivian's management team will be providing more and more clarity around the launch timeline, forcing analysts to start incorporating higher growth rates into their models.

The company currently has two luxury models in production, and while those vehicles were panned for reliability by testers from Consumer Reports, the magazine's customer surveys showed that Rivian owners were more satisfied with their vehicles than owners of any other brand. Last quarter, Rivian also achieved a positive gross margin for the first time -- a huge milestone on its path to long-term financial stability..Still, the company's valuation remains significantly below competitors like Tesla and Lucid due to its lackluster sales growth estimates. And that may offer a huge opportunity to investors..While analysts expect minimal sales growth from Rivian this fiscal year, there's good reason to believe that sales growth will pick up considerably starting in 2026. That's because Rivian expects to begin production of three new mass-market vehicles early next year, all of which should cost less than $50,000. Offering vehicles in that price range should be a huge inflection point for its business, at least if Tesla's history offers any indication. After Tesla launched its first mass-market vehicles -- the Model Y and Model 3 -- its sales went on to double and then triple in the years that followed..Once Rivian's affordable models hit the market in 2026, I expect its sales growth will accelerate rapidly. This should occur across a 12-month to 24-month time frame. Analysts, meanwhile, usually focus their estimates on the next 12 months.

Let's dive into both electric vehicle (EV) makers below and see what may lay ahead for them..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».One of the biggest takeaways from Rivian's fourth quarter was that it achieved $170 million in gross profit, which is simply total revenue minus the cost of revenue. It was a sizable win compared to analysts' estimates of $49 million in gross profit and was the company's first quarterly gross profit in its short history..While the company certainly made progress -- Rivian's cost of revenue dropped 18.6% while revenue spiked 31.9% higher -- there was a small drawback. That came in the form of sharply higher sales of regulatory credits, which added $299 million in revenue during the fourth quarter. Regulatory credits are awarded to automakers that produce and sell electric vehicles, and the excess can be sold to other automakers that need the credits to meet emissions standards..Rivian expects sales of regulatory credits to be similar for 2025 and guided for a positive gross profit for the full-year. Doing so would be a big step toward proving to investors that it has a path to profitability..At least one analyst disagrees with Rivian's management. Bernstein's Daniel Roeska warned that the company may fail to reach that goal until 2027..It's true that Rivian will face challenges. Its delivery growth has stalled, so much of the automaker's gross profit improvement will come from a reduction in revenue costs. The company lacks a revenue catalyst, with the R2 not set to hit the roads until the first half of 2026..Gross profit will be something that analysts and investors both focus on throughout 2025, and it would go a long way if Rivian could achieve its full-year positive gross profit..Meanwhile, Nio is expected to see strong momentum throughout 2025, driven by two new brands, Onvo and Firefly. In fact, during Q4, the company's deliveries broke down to 52,760 from its premium Nio brand and 19,929 from its Onvo brand. As deliveries of both Onvo and Firefly accelerate it is expected to drive strong revenue and delivery growth, but that didn't materialize quite as expected during Q4 with Firefly only having just launched.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-electric-vehicle-stocks-something-102500351.html,1.

As things currently stand, the Trump administration is set to implement a 25% tariff on imports of key auto parts in May..The analyst team also cut its 2025 delivery forecast to 37,000 units, which is down 20% from the middle of Rivian's current guidance. This point is probably the least surprising, and looking at the graph below, you can see the recent softness in deliveries..Unfortunately for Rivian investors, there isn't a known catalyst in 2025, and the lower-priced R2 can't come soon enough in 2026 to provide a spark in deliveries and revenue..When it came to the bear case, the Bernstein analysts didn't hold back: ""We expect Rivian to discontinue its Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) variants, downgrade volume and [guidance for earnings before interest and taxes], and be forced to consider raising fresh equity."".The team now expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to reach negative $2.2 billion, which is 17% worse than the company's current forecast..The bear case extended beyond financial metrics with the team noting concerns about the company's two significant victories: the joint venture with Volkswagen, valued up to $5.8 billion, and the Department of Energy (DOE) commitment for a $6.6 billion loan to help fund its upcoming Georgia plant..More specifically, the team has doubts about Rivian achieving two nonconsecutive quarters of $50 million in gross profit, or two consecutive quarters of gross profit.

In 2022, that number jumped to 24,000 vehicles, but the run rate in the fourth quarter of 2022 was around 10,000 vehicles. The next year, 2023, was the big ramp-up, with full-year production hitting 57,000 vehicles. That's when management hit the pause button on production growth so it could shift to improving profitability..This was an important shift to make because the company was losing money on every truck it sold. Some numbers will put the problem into perspective. In 2023, Rivian generated $4.4 billion in revenue from selling its trucks but paid nearly $6.5 billion to build them. Its gross profit was negative $2 billion. That's before taking into account other mandatory expenses, like research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses..In 2024, the company produced just under 50,000 vehicles. However, the goal for the year was to improve the gross profit line, not make more EVs. This involved shutting down the company's production facility and upgrading both its production processes and the trucks themselves. Although Rivian's gross profit in 2024 was still negative, it managed to achieve the real goal for the year, a modest gross profit in the fourth quarter..The success the company achieved in the fourth quarter of 2024 was indeed modest. The gross profit in the quarter totaled just $170 million. For the full year, the gross profit was still deeply negative, at a loss of $1.2 billion. However, a company has to start somewhere, and a single quarter with a gross profit could be the first step on the way to a sustainably profitable business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-scored-big-first-quarter-140500804.html,Company Performance Risk  Industry/Economic Risk  Market Volatility Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against other best EV stocks to buy in 2025..Electric cars, often known as electric vehicles or EVs, are automobiles powered by electricity instead of gas. Electric car stocks are comprised of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. Firms that make components for electric vehicles, such as batteries or autonomous driving systems, are also regarded as part of the electric vehicle industry..President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported automobiles have officially come into force, affecting roughly half of the US auto industry. According to S&P Global Mobility estimates, 46% of the 16 million automobiles sold in the United States in 2024 were not produced domestically. The policy also includes tariffs on specified vehicle parts, including engines and transmissions, which will go into effect on May 3..Wall Street analysts and investors have been skeptical of the tariffs, which some say might reduce business earnings and plunge the automobile industry into a recession..Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska stated in a recent note to investors:.“A 25% on automotive imports lasting beyond four to six weeks would likely have a chilling effect on the entire sector as [automakers] need to grapple with significant impact to the bottom line.”.Wall Street analysts believe that automakers’ and suppliers’ equities will remain volatile in the near term. The most vulnerable businesses are those with high import ratios. Several companies saw more than 60% of their U.S. sales in 2024 come from vehicles manufactured outside of the United States. Meanwhile, companies with all-U.S. final assembly lines and minimal dependence on imports, especially in the EV industry, are projected to be more secure..In the first quarter, U.S. auto sales exceeded industry forecasts by a wide margin as buyers rushed to purchase new cars before the tariffs went into effect, which many believe will raise car prices. According to S&P Global Mobility’s tariff analysis, the costs of importing vehicles, auto manufacturing in the US, and consumer vehicle costs will all rise..Analysts warn that if tariffs are completely implemented, typical new car prices, which are currently around $48,000, might rise by up to $10,000. Lower-margin, entry-level vehicles are more vulnerable to price increases or discontinuation since they are often sourced from low-cost countries and are prone to margin compression under the new tariff regime.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-inc-rivn-among-190545314.html,Market Risk  Financial Risk  Operational Risk  Regulatory Risk

(RIVN): Here is What You Need to Know","Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Rivian Automotive (RIVN). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this a manufacturer of motor vehicles and passenger cars have returned +6.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Rivian Automotive belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Rivian Automotive is expected to post a loss of $0.80 per share, indicating a change of +32.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of -$2.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.12 indicates a change of +26.2% from what Rivian Automotive is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Rivian Automotive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-rivian-automotive-130014936.html,Market Volatility

They are down some 30% in 2025. Given those two numbers, it's hard to believe there's anything positive to say about this electric vehicle (EV) company, but there is. While Rivian is definitely a stock meant for more aggressive types, here are three reasons some investors might want to buy it like there's no tomorrow..Clearly, given the stock price declines, investors do not see Rivian the same way as they did before. That, however, is more a function of the lemming-like nature of investors than anything about Rivian's business right now. Essentially, when Rivian came public investors were enamored with anything related to electric vehicles and the stock price was bid up to unrealistic heights. Now investors shy away from EV stocks, leading to Rivian's massive fall from grace..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Only Rivian hasn't been floundering along doing nothing. It is still building out its business and hitting important milestones along the way (more on this below). And it still has around $7.5 billion worth of cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, with commitments for more from key partners, to help it continue moving its business forward..While Rivian's goal of building an EV truck  from the ground up is audacious, it has achieved a great deal and appears to have the wherewithal to continue its progress for the foreseeable future..One of the most important goals Rivian has reached is producing cars at scale. To be fair, the roughly 50,000 a year production level it is hovering around isn't on par with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) or with the legacy automakers. But it still operates a large factory that is running at a high level. The many EV makers that have fallen by the wayside never got to this point. So this achievement shouldn't be overlooked or shortchanged..That said, it also isn't the end of the road. There is a lot more to be done, and Rivian is still moving forward on its to-do list. In fact, reaching material production scale was the 2023 goal. In 2024, the goal was to update its production line so it could improve its profitability. That really means reduce its losses, but the important fact here is that Rivian did just that, with its net loss in the fourth quarter of 2024 being cut in half relative to its loss in the same stanza of 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-rivian-stock-131500353.html,Market Risk Company Risk Investment Risk
175,2025-04-17 21:00:00,Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Auto-Tires-Trucks Stocks Now,Investors looking for ways to find stocks that are set to beat quarterly earnings estimates should check out the Zacks Earnings ESP.,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter..The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher..The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction..Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Rivian Automotive (RIVN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.72 a share, just 19 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 6, 2025..Rivian Automotive's Earnings ESP sits at 10.16%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.72 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.80..RIVN is just one of a large group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with a positive ESP figure. Paccar (PCAR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider..Slated to report earnings on April 29, 2025, Paccar holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.60 a share 12 days from its next quarterly update..The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paccar is $1.59, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.15%..RIVN and PCAR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon..Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The high tariffs mean the prices on millions of vehicles sold in the U.S. could increase.  Making matters worse is that Trump's trade war with China has escalated to the point where China is now restricting the export of rare-earth minerals to the U.S. These materials are used for a wide range of high-tech applications, including batteries and magnets for electric vehicles (EVs).","American automakers are reeling after President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on vehicles and parts imported from Mexico and Canada.

Here's what he said about Trump's tariffs and their impact on the EV industry..Rivian currently makes three vehicles: the R1T pickup truck, its R1S SUV, and a commercial electric van. All of the vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. at the company's plant in Normal, Illinois. As such, Scaringe said Rivian has a ""very U.S.-centric supply chain"" but it also sources some parts from outside the country: ""One of the things with automotive is the supply chain is so complex, where we have hundreds of suppliers providing parts from, say, a headlight or a tow hook or tires or the structure under the skin here that are coming from not only a set of suppliers that supply to us, but those suppliers have suppliers, and then in turn, those suppliers have suppliers, so there's tier two, tier three."".That's where Trump's 25% tariffs on auto imports make things difficult for Rivian, even though many of its parts and all of its production are U.S.-based. The company sources some of its parts from Mexico, which are subject to those high tariffs..Scaringe noted that it's trying to shift some sourcing to domestic vendors, but making the change is difficult..While Scaringe didn't say that Rivian will raise prices, many companies that are exposed to Trump's tariffs have floated the idea. The cheapest Rivian truck starts at just under $70,000, and prices only go up from there. This makes it difficult for Rivian to significantly raise costs without excluding many potential buyers, which could eventually put pressure on the company's vehicle sales..Perhaps more troubling for Rivian is that China recently said it's restricting exports of rare earth materials to the U.S. in response to Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Some rare-earth materials are used to make magnets that are used in EV motors and batteries.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-rivians-ceo-just-said-113700223.html,1. Market Risk 2.

The metals, along with rare earth magnets, are used in everything from autos to aerospace products, with rare earth metals in particular used in magnets for EV motors. The suspension comes after President Trump ratcheted up his trade war with China with enhanced tariffs on April 2..Many of the metal shipments are stuck at ports in China, awaiting new instructions from the Chinese government on the special export permit process needed to ship the materials out. Currently no guidance is in place, per the reports..China produces 99% of the world’s supply of rare earth minerals and 90% of the rare earth magnets..“It is important to be aware that there is a big difference between China requiring export licenses as compared to a ban on exports. China has announced export license requirements on critical minerals before but in many cases there weren’t any actual signs of declining import volumes,” countered Daniel Pickard, chair of the International Trade practice at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC, to Yahoo Finance. Pickard is also chair of the critical minerals advisory committee for the Office of the US Trade Representative..Pickard also believes China's move is more of a ""political message"" and that exports may not actually decrease..The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents several automakers on trade and industry-related issues, did not immediately respond for comment..“China’s ban on rare earth exports to the US slows access to a number of minerals crucial to modern vehicle production,” said manufacturing expert Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions to Yahoo Finance. “Minerals such as yttrium and dysprosium are important for electric vehicle manufacturing as key ingredients for batteries and motors. Other minerals could slow production of smaller motors, speakers, camera lenses, and LEDs,” which are used in auto production as well..Reuters reported that several Chinese rare earth sellers have declared force majeure (a legal term that means ""superior force"") on their contracts with overseas buyers, meaning they claim they cannot fulfill their commitments due to forces outside their control..Top US EV manufacturers like Tesla, GM, Rivian, and Ford (F) are deeply exposed, as they assemble many motors for their vehicles in the US.

Deteriorating financial metrics could breach loan covenants and delay access to critical funding..“Combined, we worry that an equity raise is likely back on the table,” the analysts added..While the company has outperformed legacy automakers since the tariff announcement, the analysts see ""significant risks to the company’s balance sheet"" stemming from the tariff headwind..The firm values the company at 1.05x 2030 sales and applies a 12.2% discount rate to reach its unchanged $6.10 target..Related articles.UBS maintains Industrial Commercial Bank of China ltd at 'buy' with a price target of HK$5.980.hp inc executive Anneliese Olson sells $613,817 in stock.UBS maintains Kobayashi Pharmaceutical at 'neutral' with a price target of ¥5.6K",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-stock-could-fall-nearly-135725171.html,- Market Risk  - Credit Risk  - Liquidity Risk  - Regulatory Risk

With a market cap of nearly $800 billion, Tesla's biggest days of growth are arguably behind it.  This reality has caused investors to search for the next Tesla capable of producing huge gains.","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been one of the best investments of all time. Since 2010, shares have increased in value by more than 19,000%. Even a small initial investment could have turned into a fortune for investors who held on throughout the volatility..With a market cap of nearly $800 billion, Tesla's biggest days of growth are arguably behind it. This reality has caused investors to search for the next Tesla capable of producing huge gains. If you're also on the lookout for the next Tesla, the two electric vehicle (EV) stocks below should top your watchlist..This year, my top pick among EV stocks is Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN). When you compare Rivian's growth prospects with its valuation, the risk-reward trade-off looks very appealing. But there's a catch..With only two high-end luxury models in its lineup -- the R1T and R1S, both of which can cost upwards of $100,000 with certain options -- Rivian's total addressable market is fairly limited. Most car buyers simply can't afford its vehicles. And since both vehicles have been on the market for a number of years, most early adopters already own one. This has caused Rivian's sales growth to plateau. Next quarter, analysts expect sales to decrease by around 17.5%. The competition, meanwhile, is expected to grow sales next quarter by double-digit rates..Fortunately, Rivian stock is appropriately priced for this reality. At 2.3 times sales, Rivian trades at a sizable discount to the competition. Yet, in 2026, sales growth should pick up considerably with the launch of three mass market models, all of which should be priced under $50,000, dramatically increasing Rivian's potential sales base..This is the catch with Rivian stock right now. Shares are undeniably cheap, but near term results are expected to be very poor. But if you're willing to look past 2025, Rivian's prospects should improve considerably. Expect plenty of volatility, but Rivian's valuation today is almost too good to pass up, as long as you're willing to commit to a holding period of several years..Want even bigger growth potential than Rivian? Check out Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID). There's more risk to this story, but the greater upside arguably makes up for that fact..Lucid has a significantly higher valuation than Rivian, with shares trading at 7.7 times sales. But its near-term growth expectations are also significantly higher. This quarter, revenue is expected to jump by more than 50%. That's largely the result of its new Gravity SUV platform being shipped to new customers. This is Lucid's second major model introduction, with the potential to more than double sales over time.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-high-growth-electric-vehicle-120500308.html,1.

One Wall Street analyst who recently hosted a talk by Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe does believe now is the time to jump into Rivian stock.,"Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock hasn't been spared from the tariff-inspired market crash. The electric vehicle (EV) company doesn't manufacture overseas, but it still participates in a global supply chain and is reliant on a strong U.S. consumer economy..The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Russell 2000 each hit 52-week lows as the market panicked over President Donald Trump's global tariff plans. Rivian stock plunged as well, punctuating a 20% drop over the last three months..That could be a buying opportunity for investors as Rivian enters a critical and transformational period. One Wall Street analyst who recently hosted a talk by Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe does believe now is the time to jump into Rivian stock..Rivian's CEO has been making the rounds to Wall Street analysts, expressing what he sees as a big opportunity for his company. He spoke with analyst George Gianarikas at Canaccord Genuity's recent 2025 Sustainability Summit and cited the ""extreme lack of choice"" among domestic EV models as one factor holding back EV sales growth..Scaringe reiterated that sentiment at the Wolfe Research Autos summit on March 18. He said that there were ""very few highly compelling choices"" at price points under $50,000. That's exactly the target market for Rivian's coming R2 SUV..One takeaway Gianarikas took from the summit was that he thinks now is a good time to ""pull the trigger"" on Rivian shares..Investors paying attention could get into Rivian stock just as it fills a critical niche in the market. It's also a time when some of the larger legacy automakers are throttling back EV commitments and aspirations. Rivian's CEO thinks a lack of options for mass-market electric vehicles for under $50,000 has led to the lag in U.S. adoption compared to China and Europe. He wants Rivian's coming R2 SUV to address that gap..Gianarikas agrees and thinks Rivian will soon be the leader of non-Tesla EV manufacturers in the U.S. He called the opportunity ""timely"" and said Rivian has the chance to become ""the next American auto icon."".The EV leader itself looks to be giving Rivian an opening, too. Investors and consumers alike have become increasingly frustrated with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his pivot into politics. It's very likely that damage to Tesla's brand, and frustration with Musk's public persona, has led to some amount of lost sales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-rivian-while-below-12-121500701.html,Market Risk  Price Volatility Risk  Economic Risk  Company Risk  Regulatory Risk  Tariff Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently..On Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market turmoil of the week and provided some valuable lessons. He emphasized that no one ever made a profit by panicking. Cramer pointed out how many investors had thrown in the towel during the downturn..“Yeah, what happens is they get out and then it rallies big like today, and that’s the end. Bye bye. Learn to take the pain. Staying the course is how you make the biggest money.”.READ ALSO: 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks..Cramer noted how, on Tuesday night, anyone holding stocks felt disheartened and as if they had lost substantial sums. He then pointed out that in contrast, those who were shorting the market, including many hedge funds, went to bed feeling victorious. However, Cramer had a different perspective and highlighted that some of the short-sellers, who had bet against the market just before the high opening on Wednesday, might have felt smart in the moment..But he quickly reminded viewers that while bulls and bears can make money, he commented that “hogs, those who staged short were pigs, plain and simple. He then went on to say:.“The president likes, no, no, he loves drama. He’s gonna love drama for his whole darn presidency. That’s one constant from his first term.”.Cramer said that investors should not expect any certainty from the White House. Hoping for “certainty” from President Trump, he said, would be “kind of nuts” at this point. His advice to investors was simple: when the noise gets overwhelming, “just turn it off”..“So let me give you the bottom line on this one of the most exciting days of our lives: I don’t think that things are all that difficult. They’re not COVID difficult. Now I think that you’re dealing with manmade crises. It turns out that one of these manmade crises was easily reversible, as we’ve said over and over again, and told you that when you see stocks in the blast zone rally, it pays to realize that good things, not just bad things can happen too.”.For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 9.

189,2025-04-07 06:41:00,3 Top EV Stocks to Buy in April,"Rivian, Nio, and Polestar could thrive as Tesla tumbles.","As the Trump administration's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs rattle the markets, it might seem like a terrible time to invest in electric vehicle (EV) stocks. Those higher tariffs could disrupt supply chains, drive up labor and component costs, and make EVs much more expensive..Shares of Tesla, the bellwether of the sector, have already dropped 40% this year. That decline can be attributed to its slowing sales, shrinking margin, Elon Musk's polarizing work with the Trump administration, and rising tariffs..Yet Tesla's ongoing issues could represent opportunities for smaller EV makers. I believe three of those underdogs -- Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), Nio (NYSE: NIO), and Polestar (NASDAQ: PSNY) -- deserve some more attention in this chaotic market..Rivian sells the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans. It plans to launch its next vehicle, the cheaper R2 SUV, in 2026. Its deliveries surged 147% to 50,122 vehicles in 2023 but rose just 3% to 51,759 vehicles in 2024, as it dealt with supply chain constraints, stiff competition, and a temporary shutdown of its Illinois plant..For 2025, Rivian aims to deliver only 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles as it shuts down its Illinois plant again for additional upgrades ahead of its R2 launch next year; grapples with more component shortages; deals with the aftermath of the fires in Los Angeles, one of its top markets; and braces for the Trump administration's incoming tariffs..That outlook seems dim, but Rivian's gross margin actually improved from negative 188% in 2022 to negative-24% in 2024, and it anticipates a ""modest"" gross profit in 2025. Those improvements were driven by its lower manufacturing costs, the expansion of its higher-margin software and services business, and its sales of its own regulatory credits to other automakers. It won't turn profitable anytime soon, but that progress might pave the way for a smooth rollout of the R2 next year..With an enterprise value of $12.6 billion, Rivian trades at just 2.3 times this year's sales. Tesla trades at 6.9 times this year's sales. Therefore, any positive developments regarding its current vehicles or the upcoming R2 could drive its stock higher..Nio is a Chinese maker of electric sedans and SUVs that has been taking some baby steps into Europe. It differentiates itself from its competitors with removable batteries that can be quickly replaced at its own battery-swapping stations..Nio's deliveries more than doubled in 2020 and 2021, then rose 34% in 2022 and 31% to 160,038 vehicles in 2023.

The young electric vehicle (EV) maker doesn't have any obvious catalysts to boost demand or deliveries throughout the year, and its highly anticipated R2 model doesn't launch until 2026. But is the company's slow start a reason to raise a red flag, or is it just the beginning of a lackluster year most anticipated?.As Rivian investors prepared for an unspectacular year, the company still managed to top estimates, although that might not be enough to appease investors, judging by the stock's 5% drop this past Wednesday following the first-quarter news release..Digging into the numbers, Rivian delivered 8,640 vehicles during the first quarter. That result was far from the prior year's 13,588 deliveries, but still ahead of analysts' estimates calling for first-quarter deliveries of 8,200..The problem or potential red flag is because there isn't much of a reason, other than soft demand, causing the 36% drop in first-quarter deliveries. Rivian previously had a crunch in parts during the third quarter that held up deliveries, but management has since explained that's no longer a constraint. But the drop in deliveries may leave an uneasy feeling for investors who have watched the company's deliveries peak and trend lower..There are a few developments that could be pumping the brakes on Rivian's deliveries. Investors must consider that consumers have increasingly opted for cheaper hybrid and gasoline-powered models. Management also noted that the California fires negatively impacted demand in a key EV market..Investors also have to remember that due to the supply chain disruption during the third quarter, Rivian's fourth quarter had more deliveries than expected and could have pulled a little demand forward as it pressed to catch up on deliveries..It's also possible that consumers are growing weary of tariffs and the potential cost increases being passed along; Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe admitted the company expects higher costs due to the tariffs, as it has a supply chain footprint in both Mexico and Canada..Rivian is currently expanding its original Illinois factory to begin production of the highly anticipated R2 next year, and that will be the boost in deliveries that investors have been looking for. The R2 is priced well under its R1 vehicles, at roughly $45,000, and should open the door to an entirely new and more price-sensitive consumer.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-deliveries-tank-not-time-133000833.html,Market Risk Product Risk Revenue Risk Event Risk

Bernstein analysts believe this increases the likelihood that parts tariffs “will go into effect on May 3rd, which presents a substantial downside risk for all U.S. automotive stocks.”.Shares of U.S. automakers have begun to reflect some of the uncertainty. Ford’s stock has remained relatively stable, but Bernstein sees “significant downside risk to the company’s ‘25 and ‘26 earnings.”.GM, which has dropped around 10% since the initial tariff news, remains vulnerable due to low domestic content in its U.S.-sold vehicles..Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is seen as particularly exposed, given that it sources lithium-ion batteries from South Korea—now subject to a 25% parts tariff—which could hinder future financing plans..“This will prove a severe headwind for Rivian, which could prevent the company from unlocking the next financing round from Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p), which is dependent on Rivian’s profitability in 2025,” analysts led by Daniel Roeska said in a note..Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) may face an even more immediate strategic decision. With its plan to use the South Korea-U.S. free trade agreement now ineffective and rising costs for content from China and Europe, the company “will ultimately have to decide, whether it exits the U.S. market as long as tariffs stay in place.”.In Europe, the market had shown resilience following the March 26 announcement of a 25% import tariff on vehicles, with sector stocks falling only about 7% since..But Bernstein argues the latest set of measures “ dispels those hopes,” and notes that manufacturers like BMW (ETR:BMWG) and Mercedes Benz Group (ETR:MBGn) could see margin hits of 2.0 and 2.2 percentage points, respectively. Volkswagen is expected to fare slightly better, with a 1.4-point impact..European carmakers are expected to respond by ramping up U.S. production using existing plants and shift work, potentially adding 50,000 units per year for BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes in Alabama.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impact-tariffs-u-european-auto-093002893.html,1.

Investors across the globe took a second look at the press release, likely unsure if what they'd read was true. But it is true. Rivian started a stealth program focused on micromobility several years ago due to what it viewed as a rising need for small electric transportation..""For the world to fully transition to electrified transportation, a range of vehicle types and form factors will be needed,"" said founder and CEO RJ Scaringe in the press release. ""I am extremely excited about the innovations developed by the Also team that will underpin a range of highly compelling micromobility products that will help define new categories."".The original idea was simply to investigate if Rivian could use its software stack and well-developed EV powertrains to make electric bicycles, scooters, and more. After years of effort and advancement, management decided that business had a huge opportunity and deserved to be its own company..Rivian will retain a substantial minority stake in Also, and is leaving the door open for future partnerships, joint ventures, or collaborations. Also has secured an additional $105 million investment from venture capital fund Eclipse Ventures that will help drive the new company's next phase of growth and expansion..The spinoff is an interesting move, especially considering investors didn't know the business even existed. But it isn't about unlocking value or separating a mature business from a rapidly expanding young business. Rather, it's apparently about management's desire to focus intensely on gross profitability and launching its R2 -- the fewer distractions, the better..In fact, Rivian is fresh off of its first-ever quarterly gross profit in Q4. Gross profit is simply total revenue minus the cost of revenue, and Rivian's focus helped drive its cost of revenue 18.6% lower as revenue increased by 31.9%.

Among the factors contributing to this performance, Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen Group in November was pivotal, involving a $5.8 billion investment to develop new electrical architecture and software.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against other top stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar as Trump tariffs wreak havoc across global markets..Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said that President Donald Trump’s new tariffs were much worse than expected. Cramer believes investors were getting “tired” of worrying about the tariff threat and went into a “bring it on” mode ahead of the Wednesday announcement..“Regular viewers know that I’ve never been a huge fan of free trade. It would be fine if everybody plays by the rules, but we’re the only country that plays by the rules. I want fair trade instead, which means tariff those who tariff us just as hard. Of course, I’ve been hoping for reciprocal tariffs, and that’s what we allegedly got, even if they were far more severe than I’d hoped for. With reciprocal tariffs, we hammer specific countries for putting up specific trade barriers or subsidizing specific industries. While we got reciprocal tariffs, I never expected them to be this high, nor did many other people. From Wall Street’s perspective, Trump might as well have used a meatax, which is what we were most afraid of. The term reciprocal meant nothing in the end; the term punitive is more accurate.”.Cramer Calls China an ‘Insidious Octopus’.Cramer called China an “insidious Octopus” and mentioned how the country used several “loopholes” to enter the US and European markets. However, he believes the tariffs will result in higher prices for consumers. Cramer said Trump does not “care” about falling stock prices or rising consumer prices..“Trump doesn’t seem to care about the stock market this time around. Why should he care about certainty, which I’ve said over and over again is what makes investors happy? He’s not trying to make investors happy. He’s not about happiness for us. He’s about making these countries bend to his will, and if it causes inflation, then it causes inflation. He never promised you a rose garden stock market, and I sure didn’t see one in the Rose Garden today.”.READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.For this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC.

RIVN manufactured 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 at its Normal, IL, plant, up from 13,980 units produced in the corresponding quarter of 2024. However, its deliveries dropped to 8,640 vehicles from 13,588 in the same period last year. The reported production and delivery figures align with Rivian's forecast of producing about 14,000 vehicles and delivering around 8,000. It delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024.Per Claire McDonough, CFO of Rivian, the deliveries are expected to decline in 2025 amid weaker demand that is partly influenced by fires in Los Angeles. Like other EV makers, Rivian is struggling with sluggish demand as consumers lean toward more affordable hybrid and gas-powered vehicles amid economic and political uncertainty.Potential tariff policies from former U.S. President Donald Trump could drive up inflation and car prices, which may discourage major purchases. Per Reuters, tariffs on Mexico and Canada could increase costs, given the company’s reliance on suppliers from both countries.The company reaffirmed its 2025 delivery target of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles, suggesting flat or declining deliveries for a second consecutive year, as demand for its premium R1 models appears to be stagnant.

It’s not just that his aggressive tariff policy has ignited a competitive trade war with our largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico – it’s also that the mercurial President will announce tariffs, walk them back, and reimpose them. He’s created an environment that makes it difficult for investors to predict what’s coming next..Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks..Make smarter investments with  weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter..For this week, however, we are ready to risk a prediction. The President has announced that a 25% tariff will take effect on all foreign-made automobiles and automotive parts, effective on April 2. A few immediate effects are obvious: the price of cars will likely jump, pushing the average cost of a new vehicle above the $50,000 mark. Going forward, the average age of the nation’s auto fleet, already at 12 years, is likely to increase, as vehicle owners choose to keep their cars, or to buy used, rather than buy new..Those immediate effects suggest some ripples of their own. Auto maintenance companies are likely to see a boost, as drivers make sure that their older vehicles are in good running order, and American-based car makers will find a competitive advantage in being tariff-exempt. We’ve used the TipRanks data platform to look up the broader Wall Street picture on two stocks, one from each of these categories, that look like they could gain on tariff pain; here are the details, and some analyst commentary..Driven Brands Holdings, Inc. (DRVN).The first stock we’ll look at is Driven Brands, a $3 billion company that combines automotive services with the franchise business model. Driven Brands controls a network of subsidiary franchise companies, offering services such as quick oil changes and other maintenance, paint and body work, and glass repair. Brands in the company’s network include Take 5 Oil Change, Maaco, Auto Glass Now, Meineke, and CARSTAR. Together, these – along with Driven’s other brands – employ over 10,000 people at more than 5,000 locations in over a dozen countries, and service more than 70 million vehicles every year..The prospect of tariffs driving up new car prices is likely to push car owners to keep their current vehicles longer, and older vehicles are more likely to require increased maintenance cycles. This could benefit Driven Brands, which is already seeing a trend toward increased maintenance and service demand. In fiscal 2024, the company reported a modest 2% increase in annual revenue, and a 1% bump in same store sales growth – but the Take 5 Oil Change brand reported 16% growth in full-year revenue, and a 7% increase in same store sales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariffs-pain-could-stocks-080004921.html,- Economic Risk - Market Risk - Regulatory Risk - Volatility Risk
