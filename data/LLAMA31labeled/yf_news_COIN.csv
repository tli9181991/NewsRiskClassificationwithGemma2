Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joins us now with a closer look. Ines. .Yeah, Josh. And I want to point out two stocks in particular that have just been on fire. First, let's start with Coinbase. Coinbase is on pace to close at a record. Right now the stock is at $374 per share. And this stock has seen really a remarkable turnaround. Do you remember back in 2022 when it hit a low? Back then, the stock is now up more than 950% since that time. And Bernstein this week called Coinbase the crypto Universal Bank, a one-stop Amazon of crypto services. Because the analyst was pointing out that beyond its trading platform, it has really gone into a multitude of other crypto-related services for institutions, custodianship, and also its leadership within the stable coin space. Which brings me to the next stock that we're looking at, and that is Circle, which IPOed back on June 5th. This is a pure play of stable coins. By the way, a Coinbase is a minority stakeholder in Circle. And this is the issuer of USDC, a US dollar coin, many of which, these are backed by short-term treasuries. And the stable coin bill last week really was significant for this stock, and it's bullish for the crypto industry as a whole. One analyst though did warn that when it comes to Circle, he put it on a neutral rating this week, warning of more competition because of this regulation that's coming around stable coins, because this is going to attract more competition. But look, other analysts are talking about widespread adoption of stable coins that they will be, that Circle will be capturing market share from Tether, which is a privately owned issuer. And as far as the volatility for this stock is concerned, because we've seen the stable coin really one day go up 15%, the next day go down 15%. Look, I spoke to this one researcher that told me he's very bullish on this, and he says it's not so much as volatility. It's a reflection of highly, a highly underpriced IPO. And he makes a point that Wall Street has been making now for some time when it comes to stable coins. He's saying that Circle, Tether, these are companies that are big, big buyers of short-term treasuries. This is providing funding directly to the US government for its debt. And so that there is an incentive from the federal government to cooperate, to work with stable coin issuers. This is very bullish for this type of stock. .All right. Thank you, Ines.

The stock's more than doubled since plunging alongside April's tariff-induced market panic..Coinbase’s 2021 listing marked a watershed moment for the digital asset industry, but also signaled a peak in crypto. The stock rose as high as $382 before sliding over 90% amid the prolonged 2022 bear market..Now, investors are increasingly positioning Coinbase as a long-term winner in the next phase of crypto growth, defined by rising stablecoin adoption, institutional participation and increasing U.S. regulatory clarity..The company recently launched Coinbase Payments, a new service aimed at expanding the exchange’s footprint in global commerce. Built on Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, the platform allows merchants to accept 24/7 USDC stablecoin payments without needing blockchain expertise. It already integrates with platforms like Shopify, the company said..Coinbase also benefits from the rapidly-growing stablecoin sector, having a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle (CRCL), issuer of the USDC stablecoin, giving it a cut of the yield generated by reserve assets..The broader backdrop is supportive as well.

The previous high was $357.39 in November 2021, just months after the company went public through a direct listing..Coinbase shares have surged more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, which came as the collapse of FTX raised questions about the future of digital assets. The stock’s comeback occurred as cryptocurrency prices rebounded and the industry won powerful new allies, including US President Donald Trump. Just last month, Coinbase was added to the prestigious S&P 500 Index..The rally’s final leg occurred after the US Senate passed legislation for stablecoins pegged to the dollar, which are seen as a promising payment method. Revenues from sources like stablecoins will likely allow the company to reduce its reliance on trading revenue that is coming under pressure as competition grows, Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said..The stock’s performance serves as “validation of the road map that Coinbase management had laid out to diversify its platform and position itself for long-term growth,” Palmer said. “It also signals that the market is acknowledging that crypto is here to stay.”.Coinbase shares are up more than 45% since the Senate bill passed last week. The exchange has a revenue-sharing agreement with newly public stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group Inc., which also staged a furious rally. Shares of traditional payment firms Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. have been under pressure lately, even though the companies have their own stablecoin initiatives..Crypto-linked stocks are notoriously volatile, and Coinbase shares will likely remain vulnerable to another downturn in token prices. Wall Street’s predictions suggest the stock is overpriced, with the average target sitting at just $287, according to data compiled by Bloomberg..Yet Palmer, who has a buy rating on the shares, sees a further surge to $421. In a note dated Wednesday, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani raised his price target to a Street-high of $510 — above the stock’s intraday record of $429.54 on the day of its 2021 debut.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-shares-hit-first-record-203443591.html,Cryptocurrency Market Risk

Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities..Proponents have said that tokenized equities could reduce trading costs, enable faster settlement, and facilitate around-the-clock trading..""For me, the end game is how can we elevate the entire financial system, which means not just a broker-dealer that's on chain, but an exchange that's on chain,"" said Gabriel Otte, the co-founder and CEO of Dinari..""But where it starts is creating a tokenized stock standard that's actually legal in the United States.

It has gained about 23%, becoming the best-performing ETF of the month..Most of the rally came from the explosive moves in a few stock holdings of ARKK. Circle CRCL soared nearly 750% from its June 5 IPO, powered by U.S. Senate passage of the GENIUS Act, which formalizes stablecoin regulation. The stock accounts for a 5.2% share in the ARKK portfolio.Coinbase COIN jumped nearly 30% mid-June after announcing plans to launch its own stablecoin, boosting crypto optimism. The stock occupies the second position in the ETF portfolio, accounting for 9.6% of the assets. Meanwhile, Roblox RBLX, which makes up for 7% share in the ARKK basket, rallied 8.8% on strong first-quarter results.  Tesla TSLA, ARKK's largest holding with a 9.9% share, has been riding high in June, fueled by excitement around autonomous driving and robotaxi development. The electric carmaker launched its long-anticipated driverless robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, sending its shares up as much as 10% on June 23. Despite some recent profit-taking, ARK maintained conviction in Tesla's position (read: Capitalize on Tesla's Robotaxi Momentum With These ETFs).Enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence also pushed Palantir Technologies PLTR shares to new records last week. The stock has risen 8.4% so far this month. PLTR has a 4.4% share in the ARKK basket..Cathie Wood, the high-profile CEO of Ark Investment Management, remains especially bullish on the transformative power of emerging technologies. ""During the current turbulent transition in the United States, she believes consumers and businesses will accelerate the shift toward innovation platforms, including artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and multiomics sequencing.”ARKK added shares in NVIDIA NVDA and BWX Technologies BWXT to ride AI and nuclear tailwinds. The purchase of more than 128,000 shares of NVDA, worth roughly $18.5 million, came on the heels of bullish guidance from its CEO, Jensen Huang, particularly around quantum computing and a pivot away from China in response to escalating export restrictions. The move reflects ARKK’s commitment to next-generation computing, even amid rising geopolitical uncertainty.ARKK purchased more than $30 million worth of BWXT, reflecting Wood’s deepening bet on nuclear energy. The timing coincides with favorable legislative tailwinds in the United States, as nuclear energy emerges as one of the few politically viable clean energy options (read: ARK ETFs Surged Last Week: Here's Why). Known for backing high-growth tech stocks even in volatile times, Wood expanded its stake in Advanced Micro Devices AMD last week, acquiring 247,753 shares valued at approximately $31.4 million across three ETFs.

USDG is the dollar-pegged token of the Global Dollar Network, of which Kraken is a key member..“Look, banking sucks; maybe that's the simplest way to say it,” Mark Greenberg, Kraken's global head of consumer product said, in an interview. “I spent my whole career in banking and tried many different ways over the years to try to make it better.

The Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates further also aggravated investors sentiments..The space recovered in May following positive developments on the global tariff and trade front. Consequently, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency globally, touched the all-time high of 111,798.91 on May 23. However, the situation again turned adverse after heightened geopolitical conflicts between Israel and Iran and the involvement of the United States in it..Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency space has returned to its northbound trajectory this week following some major developments. At this stage, it will be prudent to focus on the stocks of this space. Five such stocks are: Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, Hut 8 Corp. HUT, IREN Ltd. IREN and MARA Holdings Inc. MARA. Each of our picks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..First, on June 23, President Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. With this, crude oil prices and the U.S. dollar price index fell steadily. Moreover, in its last FOMC meeting, the Fed’s dot plot indicated a 50 basis-point rate cut by the end of this year. A low-interest rate regime is beneficial for high-growth sectors, such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency..Second, two Republican Senators, Tim Scott, the Chairman of Banking and Cynthia Lummis, the Head of the Digital Asset Committee Panel, introduced a bill that will define when crypto is a commodity or a security. This will allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission thereby reducing the Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulation of digital currencies..Third, the U.S. Senate recently cleared the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) seeking to regulate the stablecoin market of the nation.

31,2025-06-25 22:44:00,COIN vs. PYPL: Which Crypto Payments Stock is the Better Option Now?,"COIN and PYPL push deeper into stablecoins and crypto payments, but one shows stronger financial momentum and growth.","Retail access to cryptocurrencies is steadily improving as platforms streamline onboarding, optimize user experiences and align more closely with regulatory standards. Fintech firms and exchanges are increasingly integrating crypto wallets and trading capabilities within their apps, simplifying digital asset management for everyday users. In this context, let’s find out which of these two companies is better poised, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN or PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL.Stablecoins, which bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space, are gaining importance in shaping the digital financial system. In fact, major banks are also exploring their own stablecoin initiatives.  With tokenization, stablecoins and DeFi, retail users are set to gain access to a wider array of user-friendly and functional crypto services beyond basic trading.Yet, cyber threats remain a challenge. But as an investment option, which stock is more attractive? Let’s closely look at the fundamentals of these stocks..Coinbase, the largest registered crypto exchange in the United States, is well-positioned to capitalize on increased market volatility and rising digital asset prices. The company is also set to benefit from President Trump’s favorable stance on cryptocurrency and his push for regulatory clarity. With 83% of its revenues coming from the United States, Coinbase is strongly aligned with a domestic market that is increasingly viewed as a future global leader in crypto innovation.In 2024, the company more than doubled its total revenues and recorded its second straight year of positive adjusted EBITDA. This growth was largely driven by increased transaction revenues from higher trading volumes and expanded market share in the United States. Coinbase is also prioritizing real-world crypto adoption through key infrastructure investments such as Base — a cost-efficient Layer 2 scaling solution — and a growing focus on stablecoins. These moves reinforce its strategic vision to serve as the primary platform for businesses integrating digital assets.From a financial perspective, Coinbase remains strong, closing 2024 with $9.3 billion in USD resources, including cash, cash equivalents, and USDC, up $3.8 billion year over year. The company has also lowered its debt load, with healthier debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios signaling solid financial management and repayment capacity.Nevertheless, rising transaction and operating expenses continue to put pressure on profit margins. It also remains highly exposed to volatility in the value of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A significant price drop could hurt earnings, reduce the value of crypto held on the balance sheet, and constrain future cash flows, potentially straining liquidity and the ability to meet ongoing obligations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coin-vs-pypl-crypto-payments-144400499.html,- Market Risk - Regulatory Risk - Currency Risk - Industry Risk - Event Risk

Uh Ali, I I talked about it at the top very briefly, the rallies on some of these exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood after that stable coin news last week. I mean, it's they're they're flying off the charts. .Yeah, Brian, and I'll get to those movers in just a minute, but first let's see how markets opened here. We're seeing the Dow Jones opening flat, Nasdaq Composite up about 5/10 of a percent, and the S&P 500 striking distance of that record closing high. We'll see if these gains can hold throughout the trading day. We are up about 2/10 of a percent. And as you teased, I have a few individual movers on my radar as well. So let's first start here with QuantumScape. That stock is soaring today after the company hit a major milestone in battery tech. They started producing a new part called the Cobra Separator. So this is a key step towards next-gen solid-state batteries. So what exactly does this all mean? Well, these batteries could make EVs cheaper, safer, and longer lasting, but they've been pretty tough to build here. Now, QuantumScape saying that this breakthrough gets them closer to real world production. So that's one I'm watching. And next up, I also want to take a look at those Robinhood and Coinbase shares. Both stocks, they're moving to the upside today, and these moves come after the Senate passed the Genius Act. This is that bill aimed at regulating stable coins and expanding their use in markets. If signed into law, this could boost crypto adoption and challenge those traditional payment players. Several companies have already praised the bill, with Robinhood in particular calling stable coins a big opportunity for its platform. So just a few names that I'm tracking this morning on a day when we could see a record high for that S&P 500. .Well, you know what's crazy? Somebody probably got paid a million dollars to think of a name like Cobra Separator. I mean, wow. I mean, that's that that's a name, all right? .Exactly.

While initial public offerings (IPOs) tend to fetch outsize attention, I'll admit that Circle's parabolic rise is unusual..Let's explore what is driving such an intense interest in Circle right now. These details should help investors better understand Circle's role in the fintech landscape -- specifically, how the company is carving out a unique niche in the crypto market..From there, I'll reveal a subtle detail that some investors may be missing about Circle and explain why Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) could be the biggest crypto winner of all in the long run..Circle's business revolves around stablecoins, specifically USDC. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that pegs its value to another asset. In the case of USDC, the underlying asset is the U.S. dollar..Outside of the normal hype that IPO stocks tend to experience, Circle appears to be benefiting right now for a couple of specific reasons..First, retailers Amazon and Walmart were recently tied to reports suggesting the e-commerce and brick-and-mortar juggernauts could be exploring stablecoins as a mechanism to outmaneuver fees from credit card providers such as Visa..While integrating stablecoins into their respective payments infrastructure could take time, investors are likely enthusiastic over the news that global retailers are exploring this type of technology -- hence, adding a level of validity to what Circle's is trying to achieve..I think another reason that Circle stock is rising at the moment can be tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Broadly speaking, during periods of uncertainty, alternative investments -- including crypto -- can see some action relative to traditional outlets such as stocks or bonds..While the details above help explain why there is demand for Circle stock, what does any of this have to do with Coinbase?.According to a note in Circle's pre-IPO S-1 filing, the company leverages Coinbase's ecosystem to help distribute USDC.

While the regulatory skies are clearing for Coinbase, broader market adoption of digital assets, competition, and high expectations are reasons for caution in the years ahead, leaving me cautiously optimistic on its stock..In its most recent quarterly report, COIN announced earnings per share of $0.24, with revenues of $2 billion, which disappointed analysts who had expected EPS of $1.94. The company’s forward P/E ratio is currently 53.6 compared to the sector average of 10.36. Despite this result in early May, COIN stock has gone on to vault beyond $300 per share..Regulatory uncertainty has long been a major overhang for Coinbase and other crypto-centric firms, but the recent progress of the GENIUS Act marks a potential turning point. Passed by the Senate on June 17 with strong bipartisan support (68–30 vote), the Act lays out the first federal framework for stablecoin regulation, including key provisions like 1:1 reserve backing in safe assets (e.g., U.S. dollars) and anti-money laundering compliance..Crucially for Coinbase, the bill also permits non-bank entities to issue stablecoins—a major win, given the company’s deep partnership with Circle Internet Group (CRCL), the issuer of USD Coin (USDC). The company’s shares rose 33% in late Wednesday trade last week and are now trading 87% higher..As the second-largest dollar-backed stablecoin, USDC plays a growing role in Coinbase’s business model. In the most recent quarter, USDC revenue reached $298 million, accounting for roughly 15% of Coinbase’s total revenue and growing at an impressive 51% year-over-year, more than double the company’s overall revenue growth of 23%..If enacted into law, the GENIUS Act could help legitimize and accelerate Coinbase’s stablecoin strategy, strengthening a rapidly expanding revenue stream..Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently projected that the stablecoin market could grow to $3.7 trillion in the coming years—a staggering figure that underscores the potential of this emerging asset class.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-global-coin-adds-market-013500996.html,1.

Chris Versace and Julie Hyman with me to break down some of the top movers here. We're checking in on shares of Circle and AMD. First up, Circle. Shares sinking today as Wall Street shifted its focus to the rising risk competition in the digital token space. Compass Point and analyst Ed Angle initiate coverage with a neutral rating. Says that they believe stable coins can disrupt the financial system as blockchains disintermediate banks and payments networks. Uh, this one was interesting. I mean Circle obviously, listen, so I know it's sinking a bit today, but this one has had a tremendous run. They, Compass does go to neutral. So they're on the sidelines here. They talk about competition, they talk about margins specifically, but what a run. Folks have been very excited about about stable coin. I think this one is one way to play it, Julie. .Yeah, it's one way to play it and it's the purest way to play it in the public markets right now, right? So that's really what all this enthusiasm is about. I mean, the run that you were talking about, the stock's up like 700% over its IPO price where it was just on June 5th was the IPO. So obviously it's been a huge surge in a very short period of time. All of this because of the passage of the Genius Act as it was called, which provides sort of a framework for stable coin. And what I have found really fascinating in the days since then is all the talk about everybody else maybe exploring stable coin businesses of some kind, right, or adjacent businesses, or partnering with Circle in some cases. Everybody from Coinbase to JP Morgan to Fiserv yesterday. There was reporting that Walmart and Amazon might be exploring stable coins. So everybody seems to be jumping in on this, but stable coin, uh, Circle, I should say, is that sort of pure play. But one of the things that that compass point analysts pointed out is that eventually there could be more competition in this market, but the other thing all of this is hinging on, Josh, is adoption. Like we see this explosion. Is it pushing something that people are going to eventually pull? Do people really want this product? Are we going to really see it integrated into our financial system? And we don't know yet is the short answer. .Kathy Woods also Arc also playing a role there, Julie in the slump today. Seems like she was booking some profit. .Yeah, she, you know, Kathy does a lot of trading, right, of Arc Invest in her benchmark funds. Just looking at the numbers here, it looks like that she's continued to sell. She sold about one and a quarter million circle shares last week. Um, and then she sold more on Monday. This according to sources including Coin Telegraph, which tracks the industry. Um, it's hard to read too much into this necessarily. She does, she is a trader. There is a lot of, um, positioning that she does, but that is, to be clear, something that could likely also be putting pressure on the shares. .I'll bring Chris back here as well. Your thoughts on Circle, Chris, the blistering run, what do you make of it? .Uh, talk about a rocket ship ride for the new new thing. I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty stellar, I have to say. I, I, I think the question you have to ask yourself though is if you're just coming to the Circle story now, are you willing to put money to work in the shares after everything that we have seen, especially, as Julie pointed out, with the passage of, of the Genius Act. You know, what, what is the next new catalyst to vault these shares higher? So I'm not surprised that in such a short span of time, you might be seeing, uh, some traders, short-term investors, if you will, kind of taking some profits. I, I think they've got to come out and start announcing partnerships, agreements, joint ventures, call them what you will, with some of the folks that Julie announced. So they kind of shore up their market position in what could be a very big market down the road. .Our second other ticker here is AMD. Those shares, they're jumping today. It's after a CFRA upgrade that chip maker from buy to strong buy. Angelo Zino says they see an AMD closing the gap to Nvidia in 2026. He also raised his price target from 125 to 165. So not just a buy at CFRA, they say, no, this one is a strong buy. I also would mention you did have a Melius upgrade as well. They took this one to buy. Their target went to 175. Uh, their point being, and I think here's your money line. Investors are about to envision even bigger GPU figures in 2026 and 2008, given a sustainable surge in inferencing, where investing in AMD's platform seems to be more attractive for hyperscalers and sovereigns. They go on to tell their clients, if we're right, that stock has a lot more to go. Julie, what do you make of it? .I mean, we, you know, we love our sort of head-to-head narratives in the chip industry, right? First, it was sort of AMD versus Intel, and AMD seemed to win that battle. Now, it's sort of AMD versus Nvidia. Um, and AMD thus far has not necessarily been gaining share in this particular area in which, uh, in, in which Nvidia is dominant. But, you know, one of the things that Angelo says sort of speaks to this, he says, we see an expanding customer base for AMD's accelerator, while the company is also making progress with its open source AI software stack. In other words, yes, you're going to have companies that, that capture a lot of market share as Nvidia has. But if indeed the market is growing, the end market is growing, there is going to be room for multiple competitors to do well potentially here. That seems to be also one of the points that Angelo is making. .Chris, bring you back as well. I mean, Nvidia, listen, it's the face of AI, right? That's the place to be. But CFRA is saying, you know what? Lisa Su and her team in AMD, they're going to close that gap. .Well, I think you have to go back to my comments from a few minutes ago, Josh, that, you know, this is a rising tide that is going to lift multiple boats. And you know, could you buy Nvidia? Sure, you can. Could you buy AMD? Could you buy Marvell like I was talking about earlier, like we have in the pro portfolio? 100%, you can. Um, I think just past a certain point, as the AI adoption matures, we go from early innings to mid to late innings, which won't be for a few years, then you have to be a little more, uh, discriminating in terms of which ones you might want to own. So I, I'm not surprised. My only question is given the run in AMD that we've seen, uh, why strong buy now? Why weren't they there sooner? .How much of the good news is priced in? .Fair question.

Coinbase handles the most trading volume of any US-based exchange platform. It offers consumers its primary account for the crypto economy, an institutional full-service prime brokerage platform (with deep pools of liquidity across the crypto market and a suite of products in the digital asset ecosystem. The company currently benefits from higher transaction volumes as more of the public adopts crypto..Stablecoins are digital assets that are built to maintain a stable value relative to a relatively “stable” asset like the US dollar. Though Coinbase’s stablecoin business is often overlooked by Wall Street investors and analysts, it is rapidly becoming an integral part of its booming business. In Q1, stablecoin revenue from the USDC stablecoin, the second-largest stablecoin in the world, shot to roughly $300 million, comprising ~15% of the company’s total revenue. The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) is a landmark legislation that will seek to regulate the burgeoning stablecoin market in the US. The act recently passed the US Senate in a bipartisan manner and is expected to pass when it moves to the US House of Representatives. If and when the act passes, it will lend credibility to the market, drive institutional demand, and spur adoptions from ordinary crypto users..Stablecoins allow users to send money faster and cheaper and provide more ease for international transactions. In addition, stablecoin holders can ‘stake’ their holdings to earn rewards on their stablecoins without trading. Last year, stablecoins went mainstream and were responsible for more than two times the transaction volume of credit card juggernaut Visa (V). Meanwhile, Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin, is the most profitable company in the world per employee, generating $14 billion in profit last year with only 150 employees..Coinbase is partnered with stablecoinoperator Circle Internet Group (CRCL) and receives half the revenue generated from USDC. CRCL is one of the hottest IPOs this year, with shares more than doubling since its debut last month..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.However, investors may want to pay close attention to a major market dislocation. Though Circle derives all its revenue from USDC, USDC revenue only represents 14% of COIN’s business. Nevertheless, CRCL currently enjoys a market cap of ~$50 billion while COIN’s is only $87 billion.

Sun posted a professionally produced video of himself receiving a $100,000 gold watch that Trump’s meme coin awarded to the top four investors. Sun also recently bragged about his close ties to the White House, posting in Chinese on X “It’s all true” over a series of posts listing his links to the president and his meme coin. Sun was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Biden for working to artificially inflate the price of crypto, an investigation that has been paused since Trump took office. Sun was an early and important investor in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture Trump and his sons Eric and Donald Jr. launched in September.

Should You?,"Circle’s IPO delivered fireworks, but Cathie Wood’s selloff signals it might be time for a sober look at the stock’s nosebleed valuation.","Over the past few years, fintech and crypto-related stocks have captured strong investor interest. However, not every high-profile debut turns into a long-term winner. Many stocks have experienced sharp rallies followed by steep pullbacks, making it critical for investors to evaluate each opportunity carefully..Circle (CRCL) made headlines with its June 5 IPO, soaring from its $31 offer price to over $260 within two weeks. As the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, the company showed strong early momentum. But such rapid gains often raise concerns about valuation and sustainability..The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Says the Technology They’re Developing Will ‘See What You See and Hear What You Hear’.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Now Pays 5% of All Corporate Income Taxes in America.Get exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else..Adding to the uncertainty, a surprising move came shortly after the IPO. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, which had purchased around $373 million worth of Circle stock on day one, trimmed its position by roughly $51.8 million across the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). The decision suggests even early backers are reassessing the stock’s near-term prospects..Still, Circle’s ambitions extend beyond its IPO. The company is focused on driving USDC adoption across the digital economy..With regulation evolving and competition rising, risks persist. For those considering CRCL, it’s important to look beyond the early hype and weigh its long-term role in shaping digital finance..Founded in 2018, Circle Internet Group is a global fintech firm focused on facilitating international commerce through stablecoins. The company is best known as the issuer of USD Coin, a dollar-backed digital asset used for instant payments, trading, and various DeFi applications. With a $61.5 billion market cap, USDC is a core part of Circle’s mission to bridge digital and traditional finance..Since its IPO, Circle’s market cap has soared by over 700%, rising to over $50 billion..Following its sharp rally, CRCL now trades at a premium valuation. Its adjusted forward price-earnings ratio of 198x is nearly 800% higher than the sector median of 22x, while its price-sales ratio of 20.4x far exceeds the industry average of 2.9x. These stretched multiples suggest the stock is priced for perfection, leaving little room for error and highlighting the need for cautious expectations moving forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-dumping-circle-stock-120002444.html,1.

(NYSE:CRCL) with a “neutral” rating and a $205 price target, citing both its leadership in regulated stablecoins and challenges in distribution, in a note dated Tuesday..Analysts noted that stablecoins could disrupt traditional finance by disintermediating banks and payment networks. Circle, as the largest regulated stablecoin issuer, offers exposure to this trend through its USDC token..The company’s advanced blockchain technology and liquidity provide it with key advantages, including a complex software stack, open-source APIs, and programmable smart contracts that support features like escrow, chargebacks and AI-driven payments..Despite these strengths, Compass Point emphasized that distribution will be crucial to stablecoin market share..Circle’s current distribution partners, primarily Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Binance, dominate within the crypto sector but lack the broad consumer reach of mainstream businesses..About 60% of Circle’s reserve revenue is shared with these partners, with about 50% of off-platform USDC revenue specifically going to Coinbase. This revenue-sharing model could hinder Circle’s ability to form new partnerships on favorable terms..""Distribution is king,"" the analysts said in the report, warning that mainstream companies may enter the market through partnerships with alternative issuers like Paxos, retaining 50% to 80% of interest income. Fiserv (NYSE:FI) has already launched FIUSD, illustrating potential competition from established financial firms..Valuation remains a concern. CRCL shares trade at more than 100 times EBITDA, reflecting bullish long-term assumptions..Compass Point projects stablecoins could capture 10% of U.S. M2 money supply by 2030, translating to a $2 trillion addressable market..With USDC’s market share modeled at 20% to 30%, the firm estimates Circle’s 2030 EBITDA at $3.9 billion..However, CRCL shares already trade at 32 times the present value of these forecasts, higher than established card issuers like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which trade at 25 times 2025 estimated earnings..Near-term legislative developments may act as catalysts. The analysts expect stablecoin legislation to pass by August, potentially accelerating adoption. However, full regulation may ease entry for competitors, reducing Circle’s market share and pressuring margins in 2025..""While USDC has strong distribution within the crypto industry, mainstream businesses have much broader connectivity to end users,"" the analysts said.

Last week, most of ARK ETFs, including ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF ARKF surged about 8%..Cathie Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has faced challenges in recent years. After a sharp decline in 2021-2022, ARKK continued to underperform the S&P 500 in the following two years, as Wood largely missed the significant gains driven by NVIDIA NVDA and the broader artificial intelligence boom..However, since last October, and particularly from early April, Cathie Wood's stocks have surged, with ARKK reaching a three-year high. While Tesla TSLA, ARKK’s largest holding and the top Cathie Wood stock across her ETFs, has struggled in 2025 overall, it has delivered strong gains in the second quarter..The standout performers among ARKK’s top holdings, however, have been Palantir Technologies PLTR, Coinbase COIN and Roblox RBLX. In fact, Coinbase drove ARK ETFs’ last week’s performance. Let’s dig deeper..Coinbase shares surged about 30% last week. Each of the above-mentioned ETFs invests about 8% of their baskets in COIN shares. Coinbase Global relies heavily on trading volumes as a core driver of revenues and a key indicator of its long-term business trajectory. This crypto leader generates the bulk of its revenues through transaction fees from both retail and institutional customers..On June 18, shares surged 16.3% after the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced plans to enter the stablecoin market. This breakout pushed the stock well above a 277.01 buy point from a deep base. By the end of the week, shares had gained 29.9%. Coinbase also maintains strong ties with Circle, another prominent company backed by Cathie Wood, as quoted on investors.com..Another ARK ETFs’ important holding Tesla added more than 2% last week on Robotaxi launch optimism.

The electric vehicle manufacturer aims to establish a strong position in the competitive self-driving technology market..Roblox shares jumped about 8.8% last week.

They’re a starting point to get cautious financial institutions to try a little crypto. The tokens are seen as safer than other digital assets (ahem, fartcoin) because their value is tied 1:1 with another asset, often the US dollar..Companies are racing to get into stablecoins as the Genius Act makes its way toward POTUS Trump’s desk. The bill, which outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoins, was passed by the Senate in an overwhelming 68-30 vote last week. It heads to the House next and, if approved there, to Trump for a final signature. Trump posted on social media last week that he wants it on his desk “ASAP – NO DELAYS.” He said the bill will “make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets.”.As businesses eye the new legislation, they’re exploring how they can ride the hype:.Some of the largest US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, are considering teaming up to launch a joint stablecoin, according to The Wall Street Journal. For now, JPMorgan said it’s launching a stablecoin-like “deposit token” called JPMD on Coinbase’s blockchain..Walmart, Amazon and Expedia are reportedly exploring the launch of their own stablecoins, which could enable shoppers to bypass traditional payment platforms and pay through the blockchain..If You Can’t Beat ’Em: Stablecoins pose an existential threat to traditional finance because they let consumers bypass banks, instead processing transactions on the blockchain. So TradFi (crypto-speak for Traditional Finance) companies are getting ahead of the trend with their own platforms and stablecoins, ensuring they’ll still be a part of people’s purchases, even if they move to the blockchain.

Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre outlines some takeaways of the trading day, including equity market weakness, chip stock moves, and the rise of meme stocks..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here..Fizzle Friday is what I'm leading with. And that's because the indices, they just, we've seen volatility contracting. We did have high volume today, and I've been talking about this, and let me just switch over to the indices. We had high volume because it was triple witching options expiration. We had $7 trillion in notional just wiped off the board. And yet, we didn't really do that much. Here's the Dow, here's up eight basis points. Looks like 35 points. And if I show you the four-day chart, you can see it's just been a lot of choppy action from the upper left to the lower right, but we didn't even start up that high. Same thing for the Nasdaq, same thing for the S&P 500. And even if you take a look at the VIX, the VIX was just kind of meandering around that 20 level. That's one of those big psychological magnets. But really not even a lot happening there. There was a lot happening in crude oil, but time limitations, time limitations here. We don't have time to get into crude oil, do we? .So, so let me ask you this, Jared. Basically, it feels like summer. I mean, should we, is it time to maybe just already close the books on June at this point? .I'll tell you what, there's an interesting, uh, there's an interesting phenomenon that begins next Thursday. The last three trading days of June and the first six trading days of July is called Christmas in July. And it's kind of like the Santa Claus effect. So those nine trading days have a really high historical, uh, I guess potential to run. And I'm going to be covering that in depth next week. So we have something to look forward to, and at least that would put some maybe some green, but that doesn't take away from the fact that we don't really have a lot of volatility, at least at the index level that we're talking about here. .All right. .So this brings me to my next point, buying the chip dip. And I'm going to go to our heat map, I'm going to show you what chips did today and also over these four days. Today was kind of a downbeat day for chip stocks. This is a four-day look, and I'll show you the intraday just real quickly, so you can see only a couple names in the green, AMD and Micron. But those are two names that I want to chart here because they have been perking up recently. And here's that four-day look again. You get a little bit more green, you can see Nvidia up about 1.3%. Here is AMD, and let's put a year-to-date chart on there. And you can see just poking into the green. So, uh, chips are very cyclical in nature. They're tied to the business cycle. They got hurt a lot in the liberation day selloff. But AMD has climbed back. And also seeing some action in ARM, that was up 7% this week. That's up 17%, and you can see it didn't dip quite as far as AMD into the red. And then Micron was another leader in the S&P 500 this week. And you can see that has now surpassed its highs from earlier in the year, and it's up almost 50%. So that's not nothing. So count one for the chips, at least some of them. .I know big picture, the market has been relatively quiet. What are you seeing kind of under the hood though, Jared? .Yeah, and I'll tell you what. I am looking at some meme momentum, and meme momentum is mooning. And I just like alliteration, that's why I put that there. But the meme stocks are seeing a little bit of a comeback and some really interesting storylines here. Uh, you know, the meme stocks got their start in early 2021. And we saw a lot of IPOs around that same time. Oscar was one of them. In fact, I think it IPOed in April or March of that year. But nevertheless, let's take a look at the four day on Oscar. That kind of shot up. That's up 52%, no news there to speak of. But you look at the broad board here over the four days, that's a lot of green. Palantir, you know, you can, let me just put this on an equal weight so you get a better view. Uh, you do see a lot of green here. And also, Circle, I just threw that in. Circle, not an OG meme stock because it just IPOed. But let's check out this price action here. And I'm going to put a max chart. Could you push that in the upper right? .I can, thank you. .One more time. I think three times a charm. Look at the magic touch. Uh, here's the max chart, up 675% from its IPO. Uh, that is just incredible. And by the way, the revenue split on that with Coinbase, 50%. So 50% of their revenue is out the door to Coinbase. And guess who else is looking strong? Coinbase, another meme stock. Uh, that is up 27%. So, uh, you can see, what is this chart? This is a max. Let's go to a four-day. And you can see nice breakout here. And the news this week was all about stable coins. So Circle participating from that, and then Coinbase gets half the revenue. Good for them on that. Put it all together, there's a lot of action and a lot of activity in some of these smaller stocks that's maybe compensating for the lack of action in the majors. .So what's on your, uh, what's on your radar this weekend? Dollar, crypto? .You know, I think I need to take it easy this weekend. But if I had to look at something, I would be paying attention to probably some of the other altcoins. Bitcoin has kind of slowed down. I want to see some of the altcoins pick up momentum, and then maybe we get that thrust to all-time highs. .Right, there it is. Thank you, Jared. Appreciate it.

Buy Coinbase Stock Here.,"Rosenblatt is betting big on Coinbase as crypto heats up, calling it the front door to a rally that’s far from done.","The crypto tide is surging again. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) vaulted past $110,000 in June, edging near its all-time high, fueled by heavy institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. President Donald Trump’s renewed support and pro-crypto policy winds have only intensified this momentum. Now, Ethereum (ETHUSD) is eyeing predictions as high as $15,000 while Bitcoin bulls whisper targets near $250,000 before year's end. Meanwhile, altcoins and artificial intelligence-powered blockchain projects are also gaining serious traction, hinting at a potential full-blown bull run in 2025..Amid this resurgence stands Coinbase (COIN), the premier U.S. crypto exchange.

The company's total Bitcoin holdings have now grown to approximately 592,100 Bitcoin, which is worth more than $63 billion. Since initiating its Bitcoin strategy in 2020, MSTR stock has surged by more than 3,000%, reflecting the exponential rise in Bitcoin’s price and investor confidence in the firm’s bold treasury approach.Strategy now controls more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded company, solidifying its position as a pioneer in institutional crypto adoption. The recent Bitcoin purchase was financed through multiple capital-raising initiatives. The company utilized proceeds from its STRK and STRF at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, along with the $979.7 million initial public offering (IPO) of STRD preferred shares, completed on June 10, 2025.In addition to expanding its Bitcoin holdings, Strategy reported a 13.7% year-to-date yield on its BTC treasury, underscoring the strength of its long-term investment thesis.

COIN relies heavily on trading volumes as a core driver of revenues and a key indicator of its long-term business trajectory. This crypto leader generates the bulk of its revenues through transaction fees from both retail and institutional customers.Trading volume is primarily influenced by overall market dynamics, namely the price of crypto assets, crypto asset volatility, macroeconomic conditions and the share of total crypto market spot trading volume. While Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, represented 27% of trading volume, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, represented 11% of trading volume in the first quarter of 2025. Other crypto assets account for 38% of trading volume. Trading volume mostly benefits during the bull market phase.COIN has prioritized crypto utility and envisions bringing 1 billion or more people on the crypto rail. It is thus heavily investing in infrastructure and foundational platforms. Rising volumes not only increase transaction revenues but also boost demand for complementary services like custody, staking and subscription-based products, enabling greater revenue diversification and reinforcing Coinbase’s growth engine.Recognizing the cyclical and volatile nature of crypto markets, Coinbase is positioning itself to thrive in such an environment. It is enhancing global accessibility, deepening liquidity pools and tailoring offerings to institutional and high-frequency traders—steps that improve user activity and drive operational leverage. Should crypto markets continue to rise and Coinbase preserve or grow its market share, trading volumes could significantly enhance earnings potential, fund ongoing innovation and support shareholder value—making COIN a compelling long-term growth investment..COIN competes with Robinhood Markets HOOD and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, two crypto-oriented companies.Robinhood Markets has witnessed a recovery in trading volumes, particularly in equities and options, supported by rising retail investor activity and elevated market volatility. This growth in trading activity is driving higher transaction-based revenues, which remain central to Robinhood Markets' overall expansion.Interactive Brokers continues to deliver steady growth in trading volumes, driven by an expanding international client base and robust participation from retail and institutional investors.

Coinbase owns a minority stake in Circle and also earns a share of revenue from Circle's USDC..Read more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card?.But nothing compares to the weekly rise of little-known Winter Park, Fla.-based theme park and entertainment industry merchandiser SRM Entertainment (SRM), which is up roughly 661% since announcing on June 16 that it had struck a deal with crypto platform Tron to begin purchasing Tron tokens, rename itself Tron Inc., and bring on Tron founder Justin Sun as an adviser..President Trump joined the fun too. A day after the GENIUS Act passed in Congress’s upper chamber by a vote of 68-30, the president, in a post, called the legislation “an incredible Bill that is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets.”.No secret why the president is so cheery. As the crypto world has been racking up wins in Washington this year, Trump and his family have deepened their ties with the industry. (See chart below.).Corporations tied to Trump or his family have ventured into everything from issuing memecoins and dollar-backed stablecoins to mining bitcoin..After announcing a $2.5 billion fundraise to purchase cryptocurrencies, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) was declared effective a week ago by the SEC to issue equity and debt to begin buying and holding bitcoin..In an updated financial disclosure published a week ago, the president reported earning $57 million last year from his ownership of tokens tied to World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project that lists him and his sons as advisers..Led by CEO Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, the president’s envoy to the Middle East, that same venture launched a stablecoin earlier this year that was chosen as the payment method for UAE sovereign wealth fund MGX to deliver $2 billion in fundraising to crypto exchange Binance. Its founder, Changpeng Zhao, has been seeking a pardon, according to a Wall Street Journal report.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-circle-srm-lead-stock-rally-as-trump-cheers-genius-act-in-another-dream-week-for-crypto-163951634.html,Market risk: High Regulatory risk: Low Systemic risk: Low Idiosyncratic risk: Low Liquidity risk: Medium
85,2025-06-20 23:35:00,"Crypto stocks soar after Senate passes stablecoin bill, Circle up over 50%",The GENIUS bill would establish a regulatory framework for the stablecoin industry.,"Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week..Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday..The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions..Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night..“History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote..The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry..Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies..The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-stocks-soar-senate-passes-153544464.html,1.

The stock price has cooled since then, but the value proposition behind this hot new retail broker hasn’t..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.This new entrant to the capital markets offers a distinct model compared to its competitors, aiming to provide a “social-first” trading platform where traders not only execute trades but also share their strategies and portfolios. This creates a persuasive value proposition and a clear competitive differentiator for eToro..While most IPOs are priced for perfection—and that’s often when the trouble starts—eToro’s stock doesn’t look like a bargain, but it also doesn’t seem to be trading at stretched forward multiples. On the contrary, this gives me some reason for cautious optimism about its investment case..Of course, eToro is still within its lock-up period, so investors can expect significant volatility in the short term. For that reason, I’m taking a speculative Buy stance on ETOR..By mid-2025, crypto and online trading are far from niche, and the space is populated with major publicly traded players, including Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD). So, with eToro now entering the public markets, the question is what sets it apart from the rest..The most straightforward answer is the platform’s unique social investing element. Like other trading platforms, eToro provides access to cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and other assets through a sleek and user-friendly interface. What really stands out is that users can follow other investors’ portfolios, view their performance, and even automatically copy their trades (a feature known as “copy trading”)..This creates a much more collaborative investing experience, allowing users to build diversified portfolios in one place, which is something that competitors like Robinhood are only starting to catch up with. Thanks to this social-first model, eToro has already established a global footprint with 3.6 million funded accounts, primarily in Europe and the United Kingdom, which gives it a competitive edge that is still difficult to replicate at scale..Of course, with its strong focus on crypto trading, most of eToro’s revenue still comes from crypto-related activity. In the most recently reported quarter (1Q25), approximately 93% of total revenue came from cryptoassets, a slight decrease from 97% in 1Q24. That’s why it seems fairly apparent that eToro’s stock should move largely in sync with Bitcoin (BTC) and broader crypto market swings. In other words, it’s going to be a volatile ride.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etoro-etor-posts-strong-public-004500637.html,Market Risk  Financial Risk  Operational Risk  Regulatory Risk  Systemic Risk

Circle (CRCL), issuer of the USDC stablecoin, also surged 25% to a fresh record..The company's move aligns with the growing trend of stablecoins reshaping the global payments market. Payments companies such as Stripe and PayPal debut products that use blockchain tech under the hood for payments. Meanwhile, crypto native companies like USDC issuer Circle with its payment network are also entering the increasingly competitive field..It's still an enticing opportunity: Coinbase said that stablecoins facilitated $30 trillion in transactions last year, tripling the volume year-over-year..The new service integrates three modular components: The Stablecoin Checkout lets customers pay using wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, and Coinbase Wallet in a gasless, browser-native experience. The Ecommerce Engine gives platforms an API to handle key functions like authorization, refunds and ledgering. And the Commerce Payments Protocol executes transactions through smart contracts, handling mechanics like delayed capture or onchain escrow..In practice, this means merchants can accept USDC from global customers at any time of day, without any additional setup and lower transaction costs.

107,2025-06-19 01:51:00,JPMorgan Chase partners with Coinbase to launch deposit token for institutional clients,Each JPMD token will represent a deposit claim against JPMorgan Chase.,"JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., is doubling down on its bet on the crypto space by launching its own eponymous token, further blurring the lines between commercial banking and the crypto industry..The bank announced on Tuesday that it would be piloting the new digital currency called JPMD in the coming days, in partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase. Rather than a stablecoin, as some were expecting, JPMD will be a deposit token—a digital representation of a bank deposit that is managed with blockchain technology. The company filed a trademark for “JPMD” over the weekend..“This pilot combines the credibility of both JPMorgan and Base to help bring institutional money into a more global economy,” Jesse Pollack, VP of engineering at Coinbase, said in a statement..The token will be used to settle transfers around the clock and make cross-border business-to-business payments on Base, Naveen Mallela, global co-head of JPMorgan Chase’s blockchain division, Kinexys, told Fortune. “We have always believed in having a token-based solution on public blockchains,” he said..The bank plans to issue JPMD on Base, a public Ethereum-based blockchain managed by Coinbase. It will be exclusively available to JPMorgan’s institutional clients, which include corporations and pension funds, according to Mallela. However, JPMorgan plans to expand the use of its JPMD token to more institutional clients over the next few months..JPMorgan’s decision to create a deposit token instead of a stablecoin is a noteworthy break in an otherwise new corporate trend, and allows the bank to stand out in a crowded field..Several major companies including Meta and Google have recently expressed interest in incorporating stablecoins into their payment structures, likely because the cryptocurrency—which is backed 1:1 to the U.S. dollar—is considered more stable than other forms of crypto like Bitcoin..JPMorgan chose to launch a deposit token, rather than a stablecoin, because of its different use cases, Mallela said. Stablecoins, such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, are primarily used by retail clients for crypto trading, remittances, and as a store of value, and are managed by crypto companies, he says. Deposit tokens, on the other hand, are more suitable for institutional clients because they are issued by a licensed bank, making them better integrated into existing institutional financial systems..“Institutional clients can treat JPMD as bank deposits on their balance sheet, providing certainty around financial and accounting treatment,” Mallela said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-partners-coinbase-launch-175104015.html,Operational Risk Regulatory Risk

We are watching meta social media stocks and names in the crypto space. Yahoo Finance's Josh Shafer here to help me break them down a little bit more and do a deep dive on some of them. First up here, we got to set the stage and talk about OpenAI Sam Altman saying that meta is offering $100 million bonuses to open AI staff in attempt to build up meta's talent pool. The Facebook parent company getting more aggressive in attempts to improve its own artificial intelligence offerings. Meta reportedly delaying the rollout of its latest AI model because of concerns around quality. And CNBC also reporting that Zuckerberg is frustrated with meta's standing in big tech's AI race. This comes as meta announcing it will pay $14 billion for 49% stake in scale AI as well. .A hundred million dollar bonuses? I feel like we got to just press pause on that for a second. That's a pretty significant bonus. .That's crazy. .It makes you want to go on Udemy and start to take some quick coding classes or whatever you need necessary to qualify. .You and I are big sports fans and even someone like Patrick Mahomes, I don't think he's barely getting $100 million signing bonus, right? It's pretty shocking, but I think it gives you an idea obviously what you were just hinting at of where meta feels like they're at here and maybe needing to do a little bit more. Interesting to me because meta is one of the few companies on earnings calls that has been able to show how AI is helping their business, right? When you think about something like what they're doing with reels, how AI is playing a role in that, but this seems to be going for people from OpenAI. It seems to be more of that large language model play and doing something a little bit different and more targeted closer to what OpenAI is doing, not necessarily just using AI and sort of the AI use case space, but meta trying to be an industry leader in that large language model part of the AI story. .Yeah, seemed like he made this acknowledgement on the Uncapped podcast, which is hosted by his brother, we should note. Also here, it's interesting, this has been quite the week for OpenAI and getting some of their own major agreements here, of course, talking through some of the most recent developments here. They've got their first partnership with OpenAI and the government initiative, a pilot program with the US Department of Defense. It's a massive move forward for them and the chief digital and artificial intelligence office contract is worth about $200 million and the ceiling price for it. And essentially this is going to allow the Defense Department to identify and prototype frontier AI and how that can transform its own administrative operations. And so we'll see exactly what that looks like in practice, but this is a major step forward for OpenAI and acknowledgement of the power that they do have behind their engine. .I'm taking a look at our private market data that we have now on Yahoo Finance. OpenAI's estimated valuation per our data, $324 billion. .Yes. .If that company ever comes public, it might be the biggest IPO ever, Brad. .It could potentially be in the throws of it. Yes, for sure. I'm old enough to remember when Saudi Aramco went public though. That was a pretty large one too. Next up, we're checking out shares of social media stocks as President Trump set to delay Tik Tok's divest or ban deadline by another 90 days. The White House confirming that the president will sign an executive order this week extending the deadline, granting the administration more time to close a deal and keep Tik Tok working in the US. This would mark the president's third extension of the ban which requires Tik Tok's Chinese parent company sell off the US version of the app. There you're taking a look at some of the social media stocks on the move here pre-market. And of course it is one big pull for some of the advertising dollars that would go to Tik Tok versus a meta versus Snap versus Pinterest and how they all battle for those dollars. And ultimately, for Tik Tok, they've been able to quickly grow out their user base, make sure that they're also wooing some of those advertising dollars and how they're doing so is also making for a very competitive threat to these companies. .It's starting to feel like this ban just isn't going to happen, right? Because when things continuously get pushed back, continuously get pushed back, I just start to lose a little bit of confidence. .Such a pawn as part of the geopolitical discussions now. .Right, exactly, right? And that's why it keeps coming up. I think when we're talking about the social media stocks, I mean, the most interesting one to me is Snap, right? Just thinking about how Snap has performed as a stock over the last couple of years, I mean, it's down 25% year to date, down almost 50% over the last year. Snap needs some help, right? To bring in more users and drive future growth. Meta has still been successful with the rise of Tik Tok, right? I don't think people have an issue necessarily with where Instagram is at and what meta is doing with some of their social platforms. But Snap could use the boost. And so that's sort of the stock to watch for me as this continues and if we ever do actually get any form of a ban. .Yeah, Snap for their own, you know, defense here, the brand of ghost face chilla, they said that their community grew to 460 million daily active users, an increase of 38 million year over year in the most recent quarter and Q1 here. Q1 revenue increased 14% year over year, 1.36 billion. And it really comes back to some of direct response advertising, DR advertising as they talk about it on the call. We got to get to this last one here as well. Finally, the Senate passing the genius stable coin bill and sending it to the house in a big legislative step for the crypto industry. The bill largely requires stable coin issuers align with the same regulations that tradfi, traditional financial institutions must follow. A broader bill that currently sits in the house called the Clarity Act, seeking to regulate the crypto market as a whole here. There you're taking a look at Coinbase, Robin Hood and Circle on the move to the upside on this passage here for the genius bill. .Another headline that makes Circle stock go up, right? It feels like that stock has gone up almost every day since it's IPO a few weeks ago. .Yes. .But the stable coin conversation feels like it's really starting to heat up right now, doesn't it? I was talking to Julie Hyman about this last week and just we get in these moments where everyone needs to have a coin or everyone needs to have a stable coin or everyone needs to have their AI strategy. And when you think about the report last week of Walmart and Amazon starting to look into this, I just wonder how that conversation grows if as this act continues to work its way through the house. How does that conversation grow to? How many companies are going to try and deploy some version of a stable coin strategy? And is that report that we got last week about Walmart and Amazon, was that a they're looking into it or how seriously are they looking into it and are you and I going to need to get Amazon stable coin at some point to use Prime? .Look, all we've been discussing in our morning meetings and afternoon meeting yesterday was that this might say might make meta say, hey, hold my beer.

113,2025-06-18 21:00:00,"Exclusive: Crypto startup Nook raises $2.5 million from Coinbase Ventures, Defy.vc, and UDHC",The company will spend the money raised in this round on engineering and marketing.,"Three former engineers at crypto exchange Coinbase left the company earlier this year to start their own venture. On Wednesday, the team announced its new project: a crypto savings app called Nook, alongside $2.5 million in funding from venture capital firms Coinbase Ventures, Defy.vc, and UDHC. The company declined to disclose its valuation in the round..Nook seeks to make it easier for non-crypto-native users to increase the amount of their crypto holdings through services like Aave, which let users lend their crypto to borrowers in exchange for interest..Joey Isaacson, CEO and cofounder of Nook, told Fortune his team estimates that a user must go through 14 different steps to gain access to the average lending platform. This, he says, creates a barrier to entry for crypto investors who don’t understand the intricacies of blockchain technology and don’t have the time to learn it..Nook hopes to strip away some of the complexities of other platforms by letting customers sign up with an email address rather than having to connect a crypto wallet, Isaacson said..“What we’re trying to do is make the experience a lot easier, make the messaging a lot more clear…and stick to a clear setup where we are within the regulatory confines and we are following the rules,” he said..While Isaacson says the company plans to introduce more lending programs in the future, Nook launched to the public on Wednesday with one partner, Moonwell, a lending platform founded in 2021 by another Coinbase alumnus..Prior to launching publicly, Nook had been slowly onboarding customers from its waiting list of over 50,000 people. These users have received an 8% annual return by lending their Bitcoin or some other crypto to borrowers on Moonwell via Nook. “We can’t guarantee it, but that has been the result that users have been seeing,” Isaacson said..Because cryptocurrencies are so volatile, it is risky to engage in lending and borrowing of crypto. However, Moonwell and other companies like it try to limit the risks involved by requiring borrowers to “overcollateralize” their loans, meaning they put in more crypto than they take out of the program to invest. In the instance that the value of the collateralized crypto falls to a predetermined threshold, the borrower is automatically liquidated, meaning they’re forced to return their loan and the program sells their collateralized crypto..Another Coinbase alumnus and former CEO of lending protocol Compound, Jayson Hobby, is pursuing a similar venture called Legend. Hobby’s platform gives users broad access to multiple decentralized finance applications—platforms that facilitate a financial function without a third party like a bank—rather than forcing users to sign into a number of different accounts.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-crypto-startup-nook-raises-130000586.html,1.

114,2025-06-18 19:39:00,Barclays weighs in as Coinbase seeks permission to list tokenized equities,"Investing.com -- Coinbase is seeking regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer tokenized equities, according to a report cited by Barclays analysts.","Investing.com -- Coinbase is seeking regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer tokenized equities, according to a report cited by Barclays analysts..While the move could represent a step toward modernizing equity markets, Barclays believes the path forward is not without complications..“Tokenized equities could offer several benefits,” the analysts wrote, “including back-office cost savings, faster settlement times, and potentially easier facilitation of international access.”.Furthermore, the bank notes that the proposed model would allow 24/7 trading, similar to crypto assets, and reduce costs by cutting out traditional clearing and settlement layers..Coinbase’s plan follows a similar move by Kraken, which announced it would roll out tokenized U.S. equities across more than 50 stocks and ETFs in select international markets..During its IPO process, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) had floated the idea of tokenizing its own shares but did not receive SEC approval..Still, Barclays cautioned the initiative faces “several challenges, primarily regarding how these products will be regulated (if they will even be allowed).”.Key concerns include compliance with existing rules like Reg NMS and NBBO, KYC/AML enforcement, and integration into the consolidated tape system..“Coinbase is not an SEC-registered broker-dealer,” Barclays noted, though it has acquired entities with relevant registrations, such as Keystone Capital and Venovate Marketplace, which could be used to facilitate a compliant rollout..Barclays also questioned the consumer value proposition: “To the retail trader, the marginal benefit of trading tokenized stocks is quite small.”.While the technology may enhance operational efficiencies, Barclays says retail traders already experience near-instant settlement and low execution costs..Elsewhere, Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner at DWF Labs, told Investing.com that ""Coinbase’s move signals that tokenized equities are entering regulated market structure."".""The demand from institutions is real, and the infrastructure is catching up,"" added Grachev.

115,2025-06-18 17:02:00,Every Fintech Firm Will Run Its Own Blockchain 'in Next Five Years:' Optimism,"The logic behind this assertion is straightforward and simple, says OP Labs head of product Sam McIngvale.","It’s only a matter of time until every cryptocurrency exchange and fintech firm is running its own blockchain, according to OP Labs, builder of Ethereum overlay protocol Optimism..The logic is straightforward and simple, says OP Labs head of product, Sam McIngvale, pointing to the runaway success of Coinbase’s layer-2 (L2) network Base since its debut in 2023..For a start, Base has accrued an incredible ecosystem of users and developers to back the exchange, McIngvale said. But the biggest no-brainer is how a system like Base, combined with Coinbase’s bitcoin-backed loans, allows dormant crypto assets sitting in custody to be monetized by lending them out, he added..Base was built using Optimism's OP Stack, a software product that helps users to develop layer-2 blockchains that work with Ethereum but provide faster, cheaper transactions. McIngvale said Base's success, it's the largest layer 2 by a number of metrics including total value locked, is an illustration of how the industry is likely to develop..“I expect every crypto exchange and every fintech company to run their own blockchain in the next five years,” McIngvale said in an interview. “If you own bitcoin on Coinbase, in one button, they will take that bitcoin, move it to Base, which then lets you borrow USDC from it. And now you can go do whatever you want with that USDC.”.Both Optimism and rival Arbitrum assume a transaction is valid — hence “optimistic” — with potential fraud detected through permissionless fault proofs. Optimistic rollups boost the throughput of Ethereum's base layer by processing transactions off-chain to reduce the computation load, deriving security by publishing transaction results on the underlying, or layer-1, blockchain. Another approach is to use zero-knowledge proofs to create rollups that publish cryptographic proofs of validity for off-chain transactions..McIngvale, who was instrumental in building the custody business at Coinbase, makes the further point that simply holding crypto in cold storage on a platform works out relatively expensive..“Traditionally, there’s been a cost to custody a lot of crypto, because of all the security implications,” McIngvale said. “Unlike custodying equities, where you don't really pay for that, those equities are lent out and things happen to them under the hood. Crypto is still much more nascent, but it’s moving in that direction.”.There’s clearly been a bit of Base envy happening in crypto land. Global exchange Kraken has introduced Ink, a layer-2 blockchain that also uses Optimism. Bybit, Bitget, OKX and fintech firms like Robinhood are also exploring their own L2s linked to Ethereum.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/every-fintech-firm-run-own-090240989.html,Market Risk: High Operational Risk: Medium Regulatory Risk: Medium Cybersecurity Risk: High Systemic Risk: High

120,2025-06-18 04:07:00,Coinbase Seeks SEC Approval to Offer Tokenized Stock Trading,The move could pit the crypto exchange against Robinhood and Schwab.,"Coinbase is seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch tokenized stock trading, a move that could expand its business into the territory of traditional brokerage firms..The crypto exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told Reuters that Coinbase aims to offer digital versions of stocks — known as tokenized equities — which would trade on blockchain networks rather than through conventional exchanges. The model could allow round-the-clock trading, reduce transaction costs and eliminate clearing intermediaries..However, the road ahead depends on how the SEC responds. Coinbase is looking to secure either a no-action letter or an exemption from enforcement, both of which would provide regulatory cover for offering these products in the U.S..The push marks a strategic shift for Coinbase, which already owns a broker-dealer license through a dormant affiliate. If the initiative succeeds, it could position the company alongside retail brokerages like Robinhood (HOOD) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), which cater to a similar investor base, as well as crypto exchange Kraken..Tokenized equities aren’t yet legal to trade in the U.S., but platforms like Kraken are piloting such offerings overseas. Coinbase’s timing aligns with a friendlier regulatory climate under new SEC chair Paul Atkins; the agency has dropped several crypto-related lawsuits and set up a task force dedicated to digital assets..Still, Grewal declined to say whether Coinbase had formally filed its request. The confidence that comes from clear SEC guidance has been missing, he said..“Exciting? Yes. Important? Absolutely. But breaking news? Not exactly. We've been saying since earlier this year that the SEC should enable markets to unlock tokenized securities,” Grewal posted on social media..“Tokenized debt, equity, and investment funds present an opportunity for tailored regulation for securities that are offered and traded via digitally native methods.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-seeks-sec-approval-offer-200751159.html,Regulatory Risk Market Risk Operational Risk Competition Risk

Yes. Important? Absolutely. But breaking news? Not exactly. We’ve been saying since earlier this year that @SECGov should enable markets to unlock tokenized securities. Tokenized debt, equity, and investment funds present an opportunity for tailored regulation for securities that are offered and traded via digitally native methods.”.Grewal followed that up with a link to a March response from Coinbase to a SEC inquiry asking for input from the public about how to regulate the crypto space. The company’s 41-page response to the SEC focused on the advancement of discussions around tokenized equities, among other things..The SEC did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.“Tokenized equities” refers to an investment product in which shares of a publicly-traded company are converted into a digital token that can be traded on a blockchain, as if it were a form of cryptocurrency. That would allow customers to trade these “equities” around the clock, as blockchain transactions can take place at any time of day rather than regular Wall Street trading hours..Tokenized equities have been a long-time goal for Coinbase. The company first tried to bring digitized stocks to market in 2021, the same year as its initial public offering, by issuing a tokenized version of its own stock, Coinbase’s chief financial officer Alesia Haas said in March of this year. She added the plan was halted by Biden-era SEC chair Gary Gensler, but that under a different presidential administration that has embraced the crypto industry, Coinbase would be renewing its push for tokenized equities..“I now believe that our U.S. regulators are looking for product innovation and looking to move forward,” she said. “I’m now excited that we may be able to re-engage those conversations with the SEC’s task force, that we may be able to bring forward security tokens.”.Most companies that offer securities trading have to be registered as broker-dealers, like Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade or Fidelity, which Coinbase is not. One way for Coinbase to receive approval from the SEC to offer tokenized equities is by requesting a “no action letter,” Grewal said. That would be a way for the SEC to pledge it would not object to tokenized securities, or recommend an enforcement action.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-seeking-regulatory-approval-offer-200019827.html,1.

This friction limited what could be built and scaled on blockchain rails..Trending: Invest where it hurts — and help millions heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold..Privy's core pitch is that cryptocurrency products should work with the same ease and clarity users expect from any modern app. By generating wallets behind the scenes, the platform gives developers the tools to build cryptocurrency-enabled services that mirror the experience of traditional fintech products..Privy will now integrate closely with Bridge and Stripe's core payments infrastructure, bringing together wallets, stablecoins, and fiat payments into one stack, Bitcoin Magazine says.

The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking..Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:.Buffer or defined outcome ETFs.Leveraged or inverse single-stock ETFs.Option-based income ETFs.Some of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs..This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts..Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy Works.YieldMax currently offers more than 50 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of about $14 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market..According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap..These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income..To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spreads to further enhance yields..The YieldMax Reddit community has around 50,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income..The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks.

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this company have returned -8.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, to which Coinbase Global belongs, has lost 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Coinbase Global is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, indicating a change of -15% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -61.1%. This estimate has changed +4.1% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.52 indicates a change of +120.1% from what Coinbase Global is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.5%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coinbase Global.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-global-inc-coin-attracting-130002485.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Regulatory Risk

But times do change and so do disruption themes. So let's track the Arc Innovation portfolio shift over the last five years. I'm Jared Blikre, host of Stocks and Translation. Here behind me is a look at the top five positions in Arc by market value at two different times, before and during the pandemic boom. Now back in December of 2019, Tesla led with a modest $200 million position. Fast forward just over a year, Arc's Tesla holdings balloon to $2.4 billion as the fund's total assets exploded. The entire fund family was up nearly 400% from its pandemic lows. The ETF's holdings doubled to about 60 different names, adding big bets on remote favorites like Teledoc, Roku, and Shopify. But when the pandemic euphoria faded, so did the Innovation Fund. It lost 82% of its value from peak by into December of 2022. Now, check out its top 10 holdings here. Zoom led the fund with nearly $600 million and fast forward to today's portfolio, we can see a significant shift again. Tesla is back on top, $750 million, followed by newcomers like Coinbase, Roblox, and Palantir. Arc didn't just shrink, it rotated into themes like gaming, crypto again along with some early AI plays. So anything tied to disruption must necessarily reinvent itself. Now, let's take a look at the biggest holdings from April 2021. That was a peak, and Arc has completely eliminated a lot of these. Teledoc, once a massive $1.4 billion position, has been entirely exited. Also gone are once hot stocks like Zillow, Zoom, Spotify, and Baidu, each formally worth $700 million in arc. Take Zoom for example. It fell 5%, well, from 5% of the portfolio to zero as its stock price collapsed from about 80% over the pandemic bust. Now finally, here are some stocks that Arc has increased its bets on the most measured by the change in portfolio weight since April of 2021. Coinbase, you'll see there, was added shortly after its IPO. This was an unusual early move for an institutional investor. It's now about 9% of arc, up about 7 percentage points. Palantir, another name, showed early institutional interest from arc, added about five months after its IPO. It's now 5% of the fund, up nearly 4 percentage points. Arc also increased its already large positions in both Roku and Tesla, which has been its largest position for years by the way. These names became more prominent even as the fund shrank, showing high conviction. And today, these five stocks represent almost a quarter of the fund. Now arguably, the arc journey has mirrored the Gartner Hype Cycle that Kathy talks about often, from peak excitement through a tough trough, now onto a path of more sustainable growth. And with many of the names on a more solid technical footing, we'll have to see how far arc can climb again. And tune in to Stocks and Translation for more jargon-busting deep dives.

In an industry where two years can feel like a decade, has the UK managed to keep pace with global developments, or is it slipping behind?.On the latest episode of Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Coinbase (COIN) UK’s senior country director Keith Grose weighed in on the UK's crypto trajectory, and what the shift to a new Labour government could mean for the sector’s future..“Two years might be a long time in crypto,” Grose said, “but that's not a long time in regulation world.”.Despite the crypto industry's blistering pace, Grose said the UK is making meaningful progress. Just last week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released long-awaited draft rules on stablecoins, cryptoasset custody and exchange operations, steps Grose sees as significant milestones toward making the UK crypto-friendly..“The whole crypto regime is being put into force this year,” he explained. “The FCA is really moving quickly to make this a friendly place for crypto. They're very growth-focused.”.Read more: Crypto live prices.This comes at a time when other major markets, particularly the US, are dramatically stepping up their crypto efforts. The US Congress is debating multiple bipartisan bills, including the Stablecoin Act and the FIT21 crypto framework, while president Donald Trump has floated the idea of a national digital asset reserve..Still, Grose believes the UK has a unique advantage.

You dropped some new products, but there was something you said on stage that caught my attention. You said that Bitcoin could become the world's reserve currency because of the US debt situation, which is ballooning. How realistic is that? .Well, it really is unclear at this point, but one thing that is clear is that democracies around the world are having trouble getting deficit spending under control. And you know, that can only, if you study history, right, the changing world order, different empires, like who had the reserve currency different moments in time, once you decouple currency from hard commodities, the inevitable story is they get overprinted and extend, right? And so I think right now, I, to be clear, you know, I want the US to remain the reserve currency status. I think a strong America is very important for the world, and I think cryptocurrency is helping the dollar enormously with things like USDC and stable coins. But if the debt situation doesn't get fixed, I do think that eventually Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency, for better or worse. It's not going to be the Chinese RMB because I think they have their own debt problems, and it's not a coincidence that as we're seeing all-time highs in US debt, we're seeing all-time highs in Bitcoin. .We had a great chart in there too in your presentation, but what is the, what's the tipping point for that to happen? When debt hits a certain level, suddenly we have to worry about the world reserve currency being the US dollar? .Yeah, I mean there's not usually, it's like one of these things like the frog is slowly cooked and you know, I think if you look at other countries in the past, it was maybe around 150% or 200% debt to GDP, things started to get a little wonky. And so we're going to have to see what happens. I hope that the Congress, which is doing an amazing job by the way and on passing legislation in a bipartisan way for crypto, and this administration, the Trump administration, has been an incredible tailwind for crypto. They've done an incredible job. So, you know, I think there's a lot to be grateful for, but if I hope that, you know, the US government can get the spending under control to preserve this American experiment. .Do you agree with with Elon that this tax bill that might pass, that could be the triggering point, that's the triggering point for potential economic crisis? .You know, I'm not, so I'm reading both sides on this and I don't, I don't know enough to say for sure to be honest with you, you're a little, you're asking questions a little above my pay grade, but I think, you know, this bill, it doesn't have the full ability to touch on discretionary spending, there may need to be a follow-on bill to that. I hope that they're working on that and make the best they can of this bill, maybe there needs to be separate legislation to to cut spending elsewhere, I don't know. .What would a, what would a Bitcoin reserve currency mean to a company like Coinbase? .Well, it would certainly mean increased adoption of Bitcoin, right? I think that our goal is to power more and more of people's financial lives with Coinbase products and we started in trading, now we're moving into all kinds of financial services like payments and borrowing and lending. And eventually, I think crypto and Coinbase can be a replacement for people's bank account, right? I think that more and more of their financial life will happen on chain with Coinbase, and it'll being bring new benefits and services to customers. Like why shouldn't you earn four and a half percent on your checking account, right? Or why can't you send money instantly anywhere in the world for free? Or, you know, why can't you do, if you if you live in Turkey or Nigeria, why can't you trade US equities 24/7 with perpetual futures, right? .It's logical, right? .Yeah, I mean there, there's, sometimes there's artificial barriers and middlemen taking fees and like that's what crypto is all about, it's about updating the financial system, bringing freedom and individual sovereignty to people all over the world. .I was reading some research on crypto from the JP Morgan team and they said the retail investor is looking for the next catalyst in Bitcoin. It made sense because it's been a pretty big year, we've had the Bitcoin reserve, we have companies like yours putting out new products. But is the next catalyst for retail investors, that rising debt that you're talking about. As this continue to go, continues to go up, why wouldn't you want to own Bitcoin? .Yeah, I do think the average person in America, even if they don't quite understand, you know, interest rates and the yield curve, they understand that their money is worth less than it was five years ago, and they feel that something is inherently untrustworthy or broken about that. And so I do think they are looking for alternatives, and Bitcoin is probably the best answer, and it's that's why we're seeing all-time highs in Bitcoin prices. .Take us through some of the products you dropped today because there was a series of them and I came away thinking the next reinvention of Coinbase is underway. .Yeah. Well, for a long time we've been serving large financial institutions, you know, BlackRock, Stripe, PayPal, and, you know, large companies. But today we announced a product for startups and medium-sized businesses called Coinbase Business. It lets them manage a lot of their financial life, and we introduced a powerful set of payment APIs that allow them to pay vendors, contractors, even receive payments from their customers as revenue, and do all the accounting and tax treatment and everything in their Coinbase business account. So for a lot of startups, managing money and payments is a huge pain, it's expensive. Eventually capital formation, all kinds of things will come on chain, but we're starting with that Coinbase business account today, and those, that suite of payment APIs. Coinbase is coming into payments in a big way. We also on the consumer spending side, you know, we announced a partnership with with Shopify to power USDC payments for Shopify merchants, and we announced an Amex Bitcoin card, right? So it just shows that crypto is upending all aspects of the financial system, and Coinbase is shipping product at a startup pace. .Do you want to take the fight to credit card issuers? Is that the next frontier? .Not that directly. I think that they play an important role in terms of the products that they provide around the world, and in fact, you know, we just launched a credit card with with Amex, we have a debit card with Visa, so we're partners with them. But I do think over time crypto is going to cause the people to question the margins, right? And there's a whole ecosystem that's built there with lots of middlemen and lots of fees. If that can be done cheaper for the average customer and the average merchant, I think that the credit cards are looking closely about what is their stable coin strategy, and I think the smart ones, the big ones, will be participants in that, not left behind. .Brian, you started this day around a little after 10 o'clock on stage with Jeremy Allaire, of course CEO of Circle. That company's off a really big debut. Are you still an investor in Circle? .We are an equity holder in Circle, yep. And we're the largest distribution partner for USDC, and so we have an economic agreement with them that is perpetually renewable, yeah. .How, how intertwined, how intertwined are you with Circle? .Well, right now they're the issuer of USDC, we're a distribution partner. But our economic arrangement with them is substantial. I actually, I mean I think that the market may not be fully valuing that in Coinbase's stock at the moment. But yeah, we're, I think the big picture, it'll all work out, and we're excited about our partnership with them for the long term. Both Circle and Coinbase, we're going to be trying to get more USDC adoption, and right now every bank and Fintech company and Fortune 500 is like a new announcement every day, someone's thinking like how do we add these to make our business more efficient. .Would you ever want to put an offer into buy Circle? I mean, you're already so intertwined. .We would always consider it, but you know, obviously takes two people to have something like that happen, and you know, they're, I mean they're crushing it in the public markets, right? So it's something we'd always consider if they were interested, but I think for now it's going really well. .Since I last saw you, Brian, it was Davos, we were sweating, or we were freezing our butts off out in the, out in the mountains. But you were added to the S&P 500. Big moment I imagine for you and your company and your employees. How has that changed your investor base? .Well, I think it's, it's made our stock less volatile, you know, for better or worse, when we went public, we had, we had a large retail interest, we had some hedge funds, we had also some really great long-term holders of our stock, like Fidelity and others. But I think that with the S&P 500 index inclusion, it's kind of, I don't know if it'll create like a floor on the price literally, but I think it'll have less volatility because something like 50% of all investment dollars are passively invested at this point, and they're the largest index. So we're very happy to see that happen. It's also just a great moment for crypto in terms of increased legitimacy. .I was talking earlier with Carolyn Pham, acting CFTC chair, outgoing but still, she has that position. She made a good point that investors, bullish investors in crypto, need to remember there will be regulation, and not, there is no, there are no free rides. .Yeah. .What would you tell the bullish investors on that front? .Well, I think regulation will be a huge boon for crypto. So I very much, I mean we're actively working all over DC, our policy team, and with this administration to try to get legislation passed. I mean, we think that that's how we expand the TAM of crypto, and frankly that's why a lot of people are now coming into crypto because they're seeing the regulatory clarity is on the horizon. So my biggest thing at this point is we need to stick the landing and actually get the Stable Coin Act, the Genius Act, we need to get that passed into law, and also the Clarity Act that's going through the House on market structure, we need to get that into law as well. And so the president has said that he wants both those bills into law by the August recess, and, you know, we really appreciate his leadership on that. .All right, we appreciate you having us here at the conference, Brian Armstrong, always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. .Thank you.

161,2025-06-13 02:27:00,Shopify partners with Coinbase and Stripe in landmark stablecoin deal,Senior Coinbase exec Jesse Pollak described the deal as a “holy crap” moment for the payments industry.,"Big Tech’s fever for stablecoins won’t stop. The e-commerce giant Shopify announced Thursday that it was rolling out stablecoin payments to all users on its platform later this year in its largest crypto play yet..The publicly traded tech company lets merchants—including vintage clothes sellers, cosmetics businesses, and electronics companies—set up their own online marketplaces. By late June, Shopify will let a select group of users accept payments in USDC, a stablecoin issued by the crypto company Circle, which recently had one of the year’s hottest IPOs..“In our own philosophical framework, we are extremely aligned with everything that crypto stands for,” Tobias Lütke, the CEO of Shopify and a Coinbase board member, said onstage at a Coinbase conference on Thursday..Shopify will then gradually expand access to merchants across its network in the U.S. and Europe before opening up stablecoin payments to every merchant who uses its platform. The e-commerce company worked with Coinbase to develop a payments protocol to handle chargebacks, refunds, and other intricacies of retail payments on Coinbase’s blockchain, Base. It also collaborated with fintech giant Stripe, one of Shopify’s payments processors, to integrate stablecoins into the e-commerce company’s existing software stack..“I think other payment processors will look at what Shopify is building and be like, ‘Holy crap,’” Jesse Pollak, a Coinbase executive who oversees the crypto exchange’s wallet and blockchain divisions, told Fortune..Shopify’s plunge into crypto comes as stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, become one of the buzziest sectors outside of AI in Silicon Valley. Rather than wait days for a bank wire to clear, advocates say that stablecoins reduce cross-border transfer fees and speed up transactions..Tech giants like Meta, Apple, X, Airbnb, and Google have taken notice and have all been in talks with crypto companies to explore stablecoin integrations. Moreover, the Senate is poised to pass legislation that regulates the crypto assets. And Stripe has acquired two crypto startups in the past year as it looks to carve out its own crypto payments strategy..“This will be the beginning of a lot of dominoes falling,” Pollak, the Coinbase executive, told Fortune, in reference to Shopify’s own stablecoin play..That being said, this isn’t the first time the publicly traded e-commerce company has dipped its toes into crypto.

The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker has jumped to 3.8% QoQ as of early June, a sharp upgrade from earlier in the year. This shift, alongside expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a less aggressive trade policy, has eased recession fears and strengthened investor sentiment..Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin’s BTC appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments..Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing ""mark-to-market"" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it’s also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply..Regulatory developments are also expected to reshape the market, the report said..The Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill now heading to the House. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing digital assets. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors..Separately, the SEC is considering more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds and proposals involving staking and altcoins. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October..Overall, bitcoin appears poised to benefit from both macro and structural tailwinds in the second half of the year, while the outlook for altcoins will depend on navigating a more complex and still-evolving regulatory and liquidity environment, according to the report.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-rally-u-growth-improves-171646255.html,1.

While the largest cryptocurrency is lower today, analysts say a price of $200,000 is in play by year-end..One influence is the U.S. interest rate. Consumer prices rose less than forecast last month, increasing the chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut, which would bolster risk assets including cryptocurrencies. With core inflation stable at 2.8%, traders now largely expect two cuts this year beginning in September, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool..Then there's the Middle East. The U.S. said yesterday it was moving people out of the region over heightened security risk and amid reports Israel is considering military action against Iran. Earlier today, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, ruled that Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation duties for the first time in 20 years..With tensions rising, investors are ditching the dollar in favor of safe havens including gold and the Swiss franc as they position for a potential conflict. That has also pushed down cryptocurrency prices, with BTC losing 1.7% of its value in the last 24 hours and the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index retreating 2.25%..“Bitcoin continues to trade like a classic risk-on asset, responding sharply to macro tailwinds,” Boris Alergant, head of institutional partnerships at Babylon and a former Ripple and JPMorgan executive, told CoinDesk..“That said, the broader picture for BTC remains optimistic,” Alergant said. “More institutions are emulating MicroStrategy’s BTC treasury strategy, creating a steady base of structural demand.”.Still, the SEC’s recent willingness to greenlight ETF applications tied to altcoins such as solana, led to predictions of an “altcoin ETF summer” while signals of regulatory friendliness toward staking and protocol-based yield helped lift DeFi tokens..“This marks the first time the SEC has shown coordinated openness to both layer-1 assets and the DeFi ecosystem,” Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement..James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, pointed to $900 million in new digital asset fund inflows this week, suggesting that investor confidence is rebounding..“This resurgence comes as bitcoin trades near all-time highs and global money supply conditions loosen, suggesting there could be further upside potential for digital asset prices more broadly,” he said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-daybook-americas-bitcoin-drops-111500364.html,1.

It also shows the political heft the crypto industry now carries under Trump, with several Democrats and Republicans joining the company's payroll..The crypto industry was among the largest spenders in the 2024 election. A crypto super political action committee spent over $130 million in 2024 congressional races. Coinbase — the nation's largest crypto exchange — was the super PAC's biggest contributor..The cryptocurrency industry’s bets are already paying dividends. Congress is now moving quickly on industry-friendly legislation that would create a comprehensive framework for the regulation of digital assets amid a shift in Washington. Trump, a Republican, has pledged to make the U.S. the global capital of cryptocurrency, contrasting with what industry leaders viewed as a stifling regulatory approach under the previous Democratic administration..Americans may soon be able to invest in crypto in their retirement accounts, after Trump's Labor Secretary repealed a Biden administration guidance that said crypto may not be appropriate for 401ks and IRAs. President Joe Biden's regulators had argued that extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies makes the asset class too risky for Americans trying to save long-term for retirement..Regardless of how crypto has performed in the past, the ability for Americans to put their retirement funds — roughly $44 trillion in assets — into crypto will lead to billions of dollars in profits for the industry, if even a small portion of Americans put their assets into a cryptocurrency fund..Trump and his family have also been aggressively expanding their personal business into almost every part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including raising billions of dollars to buy bitcoin, creating a new stablecoin and launching and promoting a Trump-themed meme coin.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-adds-former-top-obama-111433510.html,1.

He urged users whose accounts are still restricted, except those sanctioned for illegal activity, to contact the support team to get the issue resolved quickly..Armstrong, in particular, hailed the efforts of Dor Levi for resolving the issue..Levi, who recently joined Coinbase’s product team, credited the firm making significant investments in machine learning models, infrastructure, modeling, and teams for fewer account freezes. He added:.The goal is clear: Account freezes should be rare, limited to situations that warrant them, primarily when we're legally obligated (e.g. sanctions or court orders) or protecting users (e.g. from scams or account compromises)..Armstrong's post invited users complaining about customer service, account verification, and multiple account restrictions to which the CEO offered help. However, crypto influencer Wendy O decried:.Damage is kinda done with retail.Wendy added that most of her audience consists of retail users and they refuse to engage with Coinbase due to this issue that she claims has been going on since 2021..Though the company last month became the first crypto company to join the much-coveted S&P 500 list, Coinbase has been facing several challenges of late, such as a data leak affecting 69,461 users and the SEC investigating it for reportedly overstating user numbers..Due to rising data leaks, many users have found it more secure to store their crypto assets in the industry-leading Ledger wallets.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-claims-reduce-account-freezes-233500780.html,Operational Risk.

COIN is steadily expanding its subscriptions and services revenues to diversify income and enhance business resilience. Transaction revenues continue to be the biggest revenue stream for this crypto leader.  As trading revenues remain sensitive to crypto market volatility, subscription and services provide a more stable foundation, underpinned by predictable, fee-based, non-transactional offerings.Subscription and services revenues have shown consistent growth, with USDC-related stablecoin income becoming an increasingly important driver. Rising average USDC balances across both customer and corporate accounts are expected to enhance stablecoin revenues, while higher prices for Solana and Ethereum are likely to boost earnings from blockchain rewards.Thus, fluctuations in USDC demand, the amount of USDC held on the platform, prevailing interest rates and key partnerships — especially with organizations like Circle — can significantly influence subscription and services revenues, which contributed about 36% to the company’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2025, up from 32% in the first quarter of 2024.COIN recently agreed to acquire Derbit, which, upon materialization, will lead to a more diverse and robust source of revenues. Management estimates subscription and services revenues in the range of $600-$680 million in the second quarter of 2025. It also expects growth in Stablecoin revenues to be offset by a decline in blockchain rewards revenues due to lower asset prices.Scaling subscription and services business by pushing stablecoin income, staking services, and growing uptake of Coinbase One and custody solutions to drive higher revenues from this source will thus play a crucial part in Coinbase's long-term growth..COIN competes with Robinhood Markets HOOD and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, two crypto-oriented companies.Robinhood’s subscription and services revenues, led by its Robinhood Gold program and other ancillary offerings, continue to grow at a steady pace. This recurring revenue stream complements the company’s robust transaction and interest income, contributing to sustained top-line expansion.Interactive Brokers Group’s non-commission revenue streams—comprising market data fees, IBKR Pro subscriptions, clearing and routing services, and interest earned from margin lending—complement its commission-based brokerage model and serve as important contributors to overall revenue growth..Shares of COIN have gained 3.7% year to date, outperforming the industry.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbases-subscription-services-revenues-fuel-163800021.html,Market Risk Revenue Risk Operational Risk

And who’s not hot? Robinhood and AppLovin, for starters. At least, not quite hot enough..Shares of both companies are slipping this week after each failed to break into the S&P 500, disappointing eager investors who thought they looked like strong candidates to get tapped for the big leagues during the index’s quarterly adjustments. Alas, they remain on the outside looking in..READ ALSO: OpenAI Careens Toward Messy Divorce From Microsoft and Drones Steal the Paris Air Show.Conventional wisdom says being on the S&P 500 isn’t just a status symbol. It’s one that is supposed to come with plenty of benefits. Namely: a steady rise in passive inflows, as index funds and ETFs tracking it buy up stock. It’s a major reason why both Robinhood and AppLovin saw positive share price movement through May as speculation swirled that they might be called up to the A-Team. For context: Robinhood is still up 26% in the past month, and AppLovin almost 11%, though they have slipped 3% and 8%, respectively, since the index revealed on Friday it’d be adding no new companies in its latest round of quarterly rebalancing..That means short-term investors looking for a quick fix by betting that the companies would score S&P 500 membership — and post-membership gains — got singed by the bad news. On the other hand, research shows that scoring that shiny new credential may not mean much in the long run anyhow, despite what conventional wisdom might have you believe:.In a study published last year, researchers at McKinsey analyzed hundreds of companies that were added or removed from the S&P 500 and found that company’s stock prices ultimately returned to their “intrinsic value” within two months of the inclusion or removal, writing “shareholder returns drive index inclusion or exclusion, not the other way around.”.In fact, that temporary bump may be getting smaller and smaller. In a study titled “The Disappearing Index Effect” published last year, a pair of Harvard Business School researchers found “the abnormal return associated with a stock being added to the S&P 500 has fallen from an average of 7.4% in the 1990s to less than 1% over the past decade.”.Door Policy: To get an S&P 500 nod, companies have to meet several criteria, including having a market cap of $20.5 billion or higher and having a positive sum of GAAP net income over the four most recent consecutive quarters. Robinhood and AppLovin check those boxes, so why the rejection? One theory recently floated by Barron’s is that they’ve both been more volatile than the broader market — though that didn’t prevent the similarly volatile CoinBase from getting accepted in May.

Tracked by CryptoQuant, it measures the price difference between BTC on Coinbase Pro (USD) and Binance (USDT), demonstrating the dollar demand for bitcoin (as opposed to crypto-native demand)..""The Coinbase Premium is gradually rising, indicating that buying pressure from U.S. investors is supporting the trend,"" CryptoQuant analysts wrote in a recent update. ""Additionally, whale buying activity is being observed incrementally."".Part of this movement would include BTC ETF inflow, which has hit $386.27 million so far this week, according to SoSoValue data..That being said, some market observers are concerned that a staked ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which may be close to getting approved, could put a damper on institutional BTC interest..Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, says that an ETF that gives investors access to ETH yield from staking would be something that BTC ETFs can't match, as they just give exposure to price appreciation..""This has created a lot of buzz, especially considering how much of bitcoin’s rally was fueled by ETF hype,"" Yang said. ""And let’s be honest: while there’s speculation around Solana or Litecoin ETFs, Ether is still the only other crypto asset with a real existence in U.S. spot ETF.

On Friday, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced no changes to the S&P 500 during its quarterly rebalance, dashing investors' hopes.Hence, HOOD stock tumbled almost 8% during intra-day trading yesterday, before closing 2% down from Friday. This snapped the six-day winning streak during which shares touched all-time highs for four consecutive sessions and gained 17%. Despite yesterday’s blip, Robinhood shares have surged 97% this year. This has been driven by the expansion of its product suite, acquisitions and favorable developments in the cryptocurrency space.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.While Robinhood’s market cap of $66 billion is way above the S&P 500’s $20.5 billion eligibility threshold, the committee overseeing the index weighs several other factors, including governance, liquidity and market representation. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is significant, as it often leads to increased demand from index funds and passive investors who aim to replicate the index's performance. This heightened demand can boost a company's stock price and liquidity. For Robinhood, the inclusion could have validated its growth trajectory and enhanced its visibility and credibility in the financial markets. HOOD’s potential inclusion gained traction as  its close competitor, Coinbase Global COIN, joined the S&P 500 Index in May. Coinbase became the first crypto-linked company to get added to the benchmark index, signaling a widespread acceptance of digital assets. Since the announcement of its inclusion in the index on May 12, Coinbase’s shares have soared 23.8%.Another HOOD competitor, which was a likely contender for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, was the global electronic broker, Interactive Brokers IBKR. Following the announcement of no change in the index members, shares of Interactive Brokers tanked 3.4% on Monday. With a market cap of approximately $86 billion, Interactive Brokers has been witnessing solid improvement in profitability as retail market participation continues to rise..Given the solid price performance, HOOD shares are currently trading at a massive premium to the industry. The company has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 55.04X compared with the industry average of 13.80X.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Robinhood’s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies growth of 11.9% and 20.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year.

Shares of the online brokerage climbed every day in anticipation, setting four consecutive all-time highs and gaining 13% across five sessions..But, instead of cementing Robinhood’s place as a contender with Wall Street’s traditional finance firms, late-afternoon Friday proved to be a disappointment to a cohort of traders watching for the announcement at the usual 5:15 p.m. time in New York. S&P Dow Jones Indices had made no changes to the iconic stocks benchmark, in turn schooling traders on the risk of front-running index decisions made behind closed doors..Robinhood shares duly slumped as much as 8.4% intraday before closing 2% lower on Monday, giving back some of their recent rally..“There’s some air popping out of the balloon,” said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, who rates Robinhood outperform. “I don’t like it because I’m very bullish, but it makes sense to see the pullback.”.While Robinhood’s market capitalization has climbed above the S&P 500’s $20.5 billion eligibility threshold, the committee overseeing the index weighs additional factors, including governance, liquidity and market representation. Other candidates, such as mobile advertising company AppLovin Corp., also fell on Monday after being left out..In an April note, Stephens Managing Director Melissa Roberts flagged that the index “may not need to make changes as aggressively” in the June rebalance because several index members are acquisition targets..“There is the possibility that the index committee feels less compelled to be as aggressive as they have been in recent quarters regarding discretionary index changes,” Roberts said on Monday..Robinhood didn’t respond to a request for comment. An S&P Dow Jones Indices spokesperson pointed back to their methodology, which said that announcements of additions and deletions for the S&P 500 Index are made at 5:15 p.m..Zero-change rebalances are rare but not unprecedented.

COIN generates the bulk of its revenues from transaction fees, its biggest but most volatile income source. Transaction revenues, which contribute over 50% of COIN’s top line, are closely tied to trading volumes and are primarily earned from spot trades executed by both retail and institutional customers on its platform. International revenues comprised mainly transaction revenues. Transaction revenues increased 18.2% year over year to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025, driven by a 26% increase in trading volume, which reflected both broader market momentum and Coinbase’s rising market share in the United States. For the second quarter of 2025, COIN expects institutional transaction revenues to be impacted by $30 million to $40 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis.The surge in crypto trading activity, spurred by increasing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs and tokenized assets, continues to drive COIN’s transaction-based income. To support long-term growth and improve crypto utility, Coinbase is investing in foundational infrastructure like Base, its Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution. In 2024, Coinbase partnered with Stripe to integrate USDC on Base, advancing global crypto adoption. Additionally, the platform has broadened its asset offerings by launching tokenized equities such as cbXRP and cbDOGE on Base.Transaction revenues offer strong operating leverage, with profitability improving as volumes rise faster than costs as well as scale globally. While inherently sensitive to market conditions, this revenue stream continues to be a key growth engine. At the same time, Coinbase is steadily expanding its subscriptions and services segment to diversify income and enhance business resilience..COIN competes with Robinhood Markets HOOD and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, two crypto-oriented companies.Transaction revenues, a key contributor to Robinhood Markets’ growth, are driven by active retail trading in cryptocurrencies, options, and equities. Making up over 60% of its total revenues, these earnings reflect Robinhood’s strong sensitivity to market fluctuations and the behavior of retail investors.Interactive Brokers Group’s commission-based transaction revenues are a key driver of growth, reflecting its success in capitalizing on rising client trading activity. This high-margin revenue stream demonstrates strong operating leverage, as increased trading volumes translate into outsized revenue gains and improved profit margins..Shares of COIN have gained 1.2% year to date, outperforming the industry.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbases-transaction-fees-improve-accelerate-160500834.html,1.

Investors threw millions at startups that promised to make the development of crypto applications less clunky and more user-friendly. While some firms have quietly closed up shop, others have now matured—and are raking in new rounds of capital. That includes New York-based Turnkey..Founded in 2022, Turnkey creates low-level infrastructure for digital wallets where users store and manage their cryptocurrency. On Monday, the startup announced that it had raised $30 million in a Series B funding round led by Bain Capital Crypto. Other investors included Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Faction, Galaxy Ventures,  Wintermute, and Variant..CEO and cofounder Bryce Ferguson said Turnkey’s appeal lies in its ability to add and streamline advanced features to wallets..“We’re moving from this world of these slow, clunky systems that were designed for buying and holding crypto to very high throughput, machine-based transactions,” he added..Like many crypto startup founders, Ferguson and his cofounder, Jack Kearney, are alumni of Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, and worked at the company’s division dedicated to holding assets for big institutional investors, like Bitcoin..After Ferguson left Coinbase in 2021 and started a job as leader of the crypto division of Trade Republic, a broker based out of Berlin, he realized there were “a lot of rough edges” around the infrastructure that companies use to hold their crypto..So, he teamed up with his former colleague Kearney, who was then working for the vaunted crypto VC Polychain, to launch Turnkey. The company offers APIs, or application programming interfaces, where developers can plug into the startup’s software to easily create and manage crypto wallets for their users. Many well-known firms in the crypto industry use Turnkey’s product, including the prediction market platform Polymarket, the NFT marketplace Magic Eden, and Bridge, the stablecoin startup recently acquired by fintech giant Stripe..The startup’s competitors include crypto infrastructure companies like Fireblocks as well as Privy, another company that lets companies easily create and manage users’ crypto wallets. Still, Ferguson says business is booming. Over the past year, the number of transactions it’s processed has increased 200 times over. And while his startup is not in the black, it does “have a clear path to profitability,” he said..Investors in the round received stock as well as token warrants, or promised allocations of a yet-be-released cryptocurrency. Ferguson, however, said his startup has no plans to launch its own cryptocurrency and the warrants are common additions to most crypto deals.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-coinbase-vets-raise-30-110000681.html,- Market Risk - Regulatory Risk - Liquidity Risk - Credit Risk - Operational Risk

The reasoning is that disillusionment with the debt-driven fiat system will lead to a mass exodus to Bitcoin due to its scarcity, neutrality and global accessibility.

And judging by its opening day, demand was through the roof..Circle saw shares price well above its initial range at $31 and once trading began on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL, shares opened at $69, more than doubling out of the gate. At one point, they even traded as high as $103.75 — a jaw-dropping 234% surge from the IPO price..So yeah. Things went well. But is this as good as it gets?.There are more than a few reasons to be cautious about its path forward. Especially if you're thinking about buying in now..Let’s start with what Circle is: Less than one half of the global stablecoin duopoly. Tether controls about 60% of the market, while Circle's USDC hovers around 25%. Despite years of growth and a major partnership with Coinbase, USDC hasn’t gained meaningful ground against Tether in recent years..Part of the problem? There’s no real moat when it comes to issuing digital dollars. New stablecoins are entering the market every day — including one tied to Donald Trump’s campaign. His USD1 stablecoin launched with Binance is already threatening to eat into USDC's mindshare..And while USDC has earned its spot through transparency and compliance, that comes at a cost. Literally..Circle's latest S-1 filing reveals just how expensive it is to be Coinbase’s best friend. Distribution and transaction costs surged 68.2% year-over-year in Q1, outpacing revenue growth. That’s largely due to the structure of the partnership, in which Circle pays Coinbase a hefty slice of its earnings to get USDC listed and supported across major venues..That relationship has helped Circle scale — but it’s also an albatross. The better Circle performs, the more it owes Coinbase. And while net income rose 33% to $64.7 million in the quarter, up from $48.6 million a year prior, its not without its capped upside..Circle’s reserve income — derived mostly from interest on the Treasuries backing USDC — rose 55.1% to $557.9 million in Q1. But that income stream is expected to drop as interest rates fall. If the Fed cuts rates in the second half of the year, Circle’s primary moneymaker could take a hit..There is also this weird disconnect in crypto. As a centralized stablecoin issuer that hasn't embraced Bitcoin or crypto the same way Tether has, Circle is not exactly a shining example of what the space represents..Unlike Terra, which famously gave its users a (brief) taste of upside, or Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDC holders don’t really share in any of Circle’s gains.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/circle-surges-200-ipo-debut-165038047.html,1.

This marked the Trump administration's first pact since it unveiled sweeping tariffs and included an agreement to lower levies on a certain number of UK car exports, among other points..Days later, the US and China announced that they had agreed to temporarily slash tariffs on each other's imports by 115% for 90 days, marking a major de-escalation in tensions between the two countries..However, the break from tensions was short-lived, as on 23 May Trump then threatened to raise tariffs to 50% on imports from the European Union (EU) and to put a 25% levy on Apple (AAPL) products unless iPhones are made in the US..Following conversations with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Trump then said a few days later he had decided to hit pause on imposing higher tariffs on the EU until 9 July..Read more: ECB cuts interest rates for eighth time in a year.Later last week, a US trade court then moved to block Trump from imposing his sweeping tariffs, having ruled that the president exceeded his authority when he used an emergency law to issue global reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners. A day later, however, an appeals court temporarily halted this order, allowing Trump to keep collecting tariffs for now..Capping off the month's trade developments, Trump said that he would double tariffs to 50% on imports of steel and aluminium. On the same day, Trump also claimed China had ""totally violated"" its trade truce with the US, an accusation which China fired back at Washington on Monday. After a call with China's president Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, both countries pledged to restart tariff and trade talks in the coming days..At the end of the month, investors were also focused on Nvidia's (NVDA) first quarter earnings, which came out on 28 May. Expectations have become increasingly high around the chipmaker's earnings, but the results appeared to pass muster this time round, with shares rising on the back of their release..In fact, the Magnificent 7 – comprised of Nvidia, as well as Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) – were responsible for 62% of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gains in May, according to financial research firm DataTrek. This contributed to the US blue-chip index clocking its best month of trading in May since 1990, though it is still less than 1% in the green year-to-date.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-bought-popular-stocks-funds-may-080435623.html,Market Risk

The event was the culmination of a long journey for the USDC stablecoin issuer, which had been pursuing an IPO for several years..For the crypto industry, it’s certainly a win — a sign of strong traditional investor demand and that under the Trump administration, crypto native firms really do have a path to going public..But cryptocurrencies themselves weren’t enthused.

CNBC’s Jim Cramer had a one-word reaction on X: “Memed.”.The post came as Robinhood Markets (HOOD) hit $72.27, with pre-market data showing it climbing another 2% to $73.75. The spike follows growing speculation that Robinhood could soon be added to the S&P 500 Index — a move that would force passive investment funds to buy shares, possibly pushing the price even higher..Bank of America analysts on Wednesday named Robinhood a “prime candidate” for the upcoming S&P 500 rebalancing, citing a meeting among investors about index changes for financial stocks..“We expect significant buying activity from passive funds,” the report stated, noting that companies added to major indices often experience “significantly higher interest from long-only portfolio managers.”.Robinhood, which initially rose to prominence as the app of choice for retail traders during the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, has since leaned deeper into crypto. The platform now offers trading for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a host of other cryptocurrencies, positioning itself as a simplified alternative to more advanced exchanges..Its crypto arm has grown notably over the past year as the digital asset market rebounded. With Bitcoin trading above $100,000 and meme coins exploding on Solana, Robinhood has benefited from a surge in both equities and crypto. The company reported record highs this week, not seen since its IPO frenzy nearly four years ago..Robinhood’s rise mirrors that of Coinbase (COIN), another publicly traded platform that was added to the S&P 500 in May. COIN shares surged 34% the week its inclusion was announced, despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny and a major hack. Notably, the exchange agreed to acquire Deribit, the world's leading crypto derivatives exchange, for around $2.9 billion in early May..Investors are now wondering if Robinhood could see a boost similar to that of Coinbase — though some, like Cramer, are already hinting at frothy momentum..While Cramer didn’t elaborate beyond “Memed,” his tone suggests he sees echoes of meme stock mania driving HOOD’s rise..Jim Cramer has one-word response as Robinhood stock surges toward S&P 500 first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 5, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 5, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-one-word-response-170000071.html,Stock Market Risk

The stock at one point surged to as much as $100, more than 200% above the $31 price it had set the night before..The company announced late Wednesday that it sold roughly 34 million shares in its initial public offering, raising $1.1 billion and landing a valuation of $6.9 billion. The listing marks Circle’s long-awaited arrival on public markets after previous attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021..Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management expressed interest in buying as much as $150 million worth of the circle shares, with BlackRock also intending to buy 10% of the shares, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg..The IPO draws comparisons to crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO on Nasdaq, which saw a volatile session with shares trading as high as $430 before tumbling to $200 one month later..Elsewhere, crypto-linked stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), along with bitcoin BTC, were trading lower on Thursday. Circle's shares seem to have stabilized around $80 to $83 per share..Circle's debut lands in a market still wrestling with an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Earnings season is winding down, and more companies have flagged weak outlooks for the next quarter than strong ones, suggesting that U.S. stocks could face added pressure in the months ahead..However, Circle’s core business — issuing the dollar-pegged USDC token — is benefiting from a different trend. Demand for stablecoins has grown in 2025, partly due to progress on U.S. regulation. Policymakers have signaled they’re moving closer to establishing clearer rules, which could help legitimize and expand the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance..Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last month that stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream. The bank cited their growing role in digital payments, cross-border settlement and treasury management while also reinforcing the U.S. dollar's dominance globally..Circle’s IPO may be early evidence of that shift — an investor bet not just on a crypto company, but on stablecoins becoming essential financial infrastructure..Read more: Circle’s IPO Filing Tests Crypto Market Confidence After Trump’s Tariff Shock.Update (June 5, 17:09 UTC): Adds price action and additional context about shareholders and the Coinbase IPO comparison. .Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
