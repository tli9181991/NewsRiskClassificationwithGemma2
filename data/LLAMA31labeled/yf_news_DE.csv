See the full list for free..If you want to know who really controls Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)..Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait..Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Deere.. See our latest analysis for Deere .Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices..Deere already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Deere's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story..Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Deere is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 6.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively..A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-company-nyse-favorite-amongst-110020618.html,Systemic Risk

3,2025-06-24 22:19:00,Can Deere Sustain Its 5-Year Double-Digit Dividend Growth Streak?,"DE's five-year dividend growth of 18.2% and consistent shareholder returns highlight its income strength, even as earnings decline.","Deere & Company DE has delivered impressive dividend growth in recent years, positioning itself as a strong income-generating stock within the manufacturing farm equipment industry. It offers a dividend yield of 1.24%, higher than the industry average of 1.10%. Deere has significantly ramped up shareholder returns since resuming dividend hikes after a pandemic induced pause in 2020. Its current payout ratio of 31% also outscores the industry’s 24.71%..Impressively, Deere raised its dividend eight times in the past five years, including twice each in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. The company has more than doubled the quarterly payout from 76 cents to $1.62 per share in this period. This translates to a five-year dividend growth of 18.2%..What makes Deere’s story even more compelling is its steady increase in return of capital through both dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2020, the company returned $4.76 billion to shareholders, or 36% of its cash flow from equipment operations. In fiscal 2024, the company returned $6.9 billion to its shareholders, or 81% of its cash flow from equipment operations..This is commendable, considering that Deere’s net sales started declining from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, with earnings growth turning negative since the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to lower demand in its end markets. For fiscal 2025, DE expects net income at $4.75-$5.50 billion, with the midpoint implying a 28% year-over-year decline. Cash flow from equipment operations is expected at $4.5-$5.5 billion for fiscal 2025, with capital expenditure budgeted at $1.4 billion. This will leave enough free cash flow to cover current dividend payments. With earnings expected to improve from next fiscal onwards, another hike can be expected from Deere..That said, Deere’s debt-to-capital ratio of 0.73 is among the highest in the industry. If it chooses to prioritize debt repayment or capital spending, the double-digit growth pace may decelerate..Caterpillar Inc. CAT offers a dividend yield of 1.69%, which outpaces the manufacturing - construction and mining industry’s 1.58%. Caterpillar recently announced 7% hike in quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share, its 31st consecutive annual increase..Over the past five years, Caterpillar’s dividend has grown at a rate of around 8%, supported by a near doubling of its free cash flow. Caterpillar has a payout ratio of 26.91% and a dividend/free cash flow ratio of 0.31. It has set a target to continue to return substantially all Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-sustain-5-double-digit-131900072.html,1.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .U.S. sales of tractors and combines continued to decline in May as farm equipment manufacturers faced economic headwinds related to tariffs and rising input costs..The total number of two-wheel- and four-wheel-drive tractors sold during the month declined 11.9% from last year to 21,192, according to recent U.S. data from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. That marked a difference of 2,864 units..Meanwhile, markets in Canada are experiencing a turnaround as the country distributes payments to farmers who adopt sustainable practices. Regional sales up 35.7% year-to-date for four-wheel-drive tractors..U.S. tractor manufacturers have struggled with sales in recent years..Deere & Co., the world’s largest farm equipment maker, reported a 30% year-over-year drop in net income to $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2024, due to market challenges as farmer incomes shrank..In response, Deere and competitors have slowed production to align with weaker demand, slashing factory jobs and reducing hours of operation. As tariffs inject more uncertainty and volatility into the market, Deere Chairman and CEO John May said in an earnings call last month that the company is performing better than expected and is hopeful U.S. sales will begin to rebound this year after a sluggish start..From January to May, U.S. sales were down 12.8% over last year to 80,332 tractors, according to the AEM. Meanwhile, 957 fewer combines were sold in the period, a decline of 43.3% over last year..“This continued slump of U.S. tractor and combine sales reflects broader challenges in the ag economy,” Curt Blades, senior vice president of the AEM, said in a statement. “High interest rates, global trade uncertainty and increased input prices are causing farmers to delay major equipment purchases.”.As for markets in Canada, a rebound is already happening. Combine sales, for example, were up 15.7% in May over last year. Additionally, two-wheel- and four-wheel-drive tractors are slightly higher year-to-date..Earlier this year, Canada’s government announced $35.3 million in payments to farmers who adopt sustainable farming practices, including efforts to reduce herbicide use and improve soil management. Some of the newer tractors on the market have digital monitoring systems to help farmers adopt more sustainable, cost-effective practices..“We’re encouraged by the strong performance in the Canadian market and remain hopeful that overall conditions will improve as the planting season progresses,” May added.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-tractor-slump-continues-canada-115200583.html,1.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a...","There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Deere (NYSE:DE) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Deere:.Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities).0.10 = US$7.3b ÷ (US$106b - US$37b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2025)..So, Deere has an ROCE of 10%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Machinery industry average of 11%.. Check out our latest analysis for Deere .In the above chart we have measured Deere's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Deere  for free..Deere is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 10%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 33% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Deere thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital..To sum it up, Deere has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 276% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Deere can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead..Like most companies, Deere does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of..While Deere may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Deere (DE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this agricultural equipment manufacturer have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, which Deere falls in, has lost 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Deere is expected to post earnings of $4.60 per share, indicating a change of -26.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $18.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.04 indicates a change of +17.1% from what Deere is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Deere.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-company-trending-stock-facts-130004602.html,Market risk  Operational risk  Compliance risk
7,2025-06-18 19:54:00,Can DE Weather the Persistent Weakness in Equipment Volumes?,"Deere faces continued pressure as agricultural and construction volumes decline, with the 2025 outlook signaling deeper contraction ahead.","Deere & Company DE continues to grapple with persistent volume pressures in its equipment operations, marking eight consecutive quarters of decline. The most pronounced weakness was noted in the Agricultural & Turf segment, which has now seen eight straight quarters of contraction. Meanwhile, the Construction & Forestry division has registered six quarters of declines..Weak farmer sentiment, subdued by soft commodity prices, high input costs and elevated interest rates, has dampened demand for agricultural machinery. Despite U.S. net farm income forecasts being revised higher on government aid, this is not expected to boost the demand for farm equipment in the near term. Trade uncertainty and high interest rates have also curtailed order activity for both construction and compact construction equipment..Deere anticipates a challenging industry outlook for fiscal 2025, particularly in the large agriculture equipment market in the United States and Canada, which is expected to decline 30%. The small agriculture and turf equipment market in the United States and Canada is projected to decline 10-15%. European agricultural markets are expected to decline approximately 5%, while South American agricultural markets are forecast to remain flat. Asia market is expected to be down slightly..Construction equipment demand is similarly under pressure. Deere expects a 10% drop in U.S. and Canadian construction equipment sales, with compact equipment down 5%. While infrastructure spending remains a tailwind, trade uncertainty and high interest rates are pressuring order activity for both construction and compact construction equipment. Global forestry equipment is forecast to be flat to down 5%, while the global roadbuilding market is expected to remain flat..Our model projects a 17.6% drop in volumes in the Production & Precision AG segment for fiscal 2025 and a 14.2% decline in the Small AG & Turf segment’s volumes. This is expected to lead to a 16.4% decline in volumes in the Agricultural & Turf segment. The Construction & Forestry segment is expected to see a 12.4% decline in volumes in 2025. Overall, the Equipment Operations’ volumes are expected to decline 15.3% in 2025..Industry peers like AGCO Corporation AGCO and CNH Industrial N.V CNH are also struggling. AGCO has seen six straight quarters of negative organic growth due to weak volumes. AGCO expects this trend to continue through the year and be a drag on 2025 sales and operating margins.

Challenges such as skilled labor shortages and high investment costs present restraints. In 2024, tractors above 150 HP lead, with a notable preference for 2WD models. Major players like John Deere and AGCO Corporation dominate the landscape through innovation and strategic partnerships..German Tractors Market.Dublin, June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Germany Tractors Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The German Tractors Market was sized at 27,595 units in 2024, and is projected to reach 31,150 units by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 2.04%. The impact of tariffs on the German tractor market is going to be low to moderate due to the country's strong domestic manufacturing base and established trade relationships within the EU, which mitigate reliance on imports from high-tariff regions.The potential imposition of higher U.S. tariffs poses a moderate risk to Germany's agricultural machinery exports, particularly tractors. If the proposed 20-25% tariffs on German machinery, including agricultural tractors, are implemented by the U.S. after July 9, 2025, it could significantly reduce the price competitiveness of German tractors in the American market..MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS.Adoption of Precision AgricultureGermany, known for its efficiency and technological prowess, has embraced precision agriculture. Precision agriculture integrates a suite of advanced technologies - including digital tools, automation, and real-time data analysis - to improve farming efficiency, productivity, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, farmers increasingly recognize the opportunities in digitalization..The digital wave is gaining momentum in German agriculture. This was shown by a survey conducted by the digital association Bitkom and the DLG (German Agricultural Society) in 2024: A high proportion of farms already apply fertilizers (36%) and pesticides (30%) using precision field maps. Predictive maintenance for agricultural machinery is used by a quarter of farms. This growing trend is driving the demand for tractors in Germany to support data-driven farming and propels the Germany tractor market growth.Growing Outlook of Electric TractorsAs awareness of environmental issues and the need for sustainable solutions continues to grow, electric tractors are becoming attractive to farmers and agricultural businesses in the Germany tractor market. Manufacturers are developing electric tractor models to meet emerging requirements and support the transition to low-emission agricultural practices. One example is, after the Fendt e100 V Vario, Fendt is now introducing the standard Fendt e100 Vario tractor. Also, European countries have implemented robust policies to encourage the use of electric tractors. For instance, Germany offers subsidies for electric machinery as part of its climate protection program. Germany earmarks $3 billion for decarbonization subsidies, according to Reuters, in 2024.Rising Alternative Fueled TractorsTo make vehicles more efficient and the air cleaner, petrol and diesel are increasingly being replaced by alternative fuels. These include natural gas, hydrogen, synthetic methane, and biomethane. The transition toward carbon-neutral agriculture is accelerating, driven by advancements in alternative fuel technologies, strategic investments from key manufacturers, and supportive policy initiatives, underscoring the need for a multi-technology approach to meet the diverse demands of the agricultural sector sustainably.Growing Demand for FoodGermany experiences ongoing demographic shifts and population growth, and the demand for essential resources continues to rise. As Germany grapples with demographic changes and a shrinking workforce, immigration is becoming essential to sustaining economic stability and population growth. For instance, according to Business Standard Private Ltd. In 2024, Germany's economy will need nearly 288,000 immigrants annually until 2040 to address challenges posed by an aging population. The resulting population growth and changing consumption patterns are expected to increase the food demand in the country.Strong Export Demand for German TractorsGermany's strong export demand for tractors seems that its tractor manufacturing industry remains closely tied to global agricultural needs. Tractors exported from all countries totaled US$87.2 billion in 2023. That dollar amount reflects a 53.7% gain from $56.7 billion 5 years earlier during 2019 with Germany ranking among the top five exporters.INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/germany-tractors-market-trends-forecast-082700139.html,1.

CAT’s payout ratio of 26.91% is also higher than the industry’s 23.61%..This announcement comes at a critical juncture for Caterpillar, following a weaker-than-expected first-quarter 2025 performance, with both revenues and earnings declining due to softer volumes. The company's guidance for ""slightly lower"" full-year revenues (factoring in tariffs) had raised doubts about a dividend hike this year. Nonetheless, the increase signals management’s confidence in its long-term cash-generating capacity..Notably, Caterpillar has paid a cash dividend every year since it was formed and has paid a quarterly dividend since 1933. CAT has been a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index since 2019..Over the past five years, Caterpillar’s dividend has grown at a rate of around 8%, supported by a near doubling of its free cash flow. In 2024, the company returned around $10.3 billion to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases, and another $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Caterpillar has a dividend/free cash flow ratio of 0.31..It has set a target to continue to return substantially all Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases..Caterpillar’s recent dividend hike bolsters investor confidence in its long-term growth outlook. Supported by continued technological innovation and an anticipated rebound in end-market demand, the company remains well-positioned to generate steady cash flows and drive sustainable growth, even as it contends with short-term headwinds like tariffs and broader economic pressures..Illinois Tool Works Inc. ITW, a multi-industrial manufacturing leader, is also a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. It has an impressive dividend growth streak of 61 years. In August 2024, Illinois Tool Works raised its dividend by 7% to the current quarterly payout of $1.50. The company generally raises the dividend in August and to maintain its position in the Index, another rate hike is likely on the cards. Illinois Tool Works has a five-year dividend growth of 7.1% and a current yield of 2.48%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cats-dividend-hike-revive-investor-151500369.html,1.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .Deere & Co. must face a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleging that the tractor maker forced farmers to use its authorized dealers for parts and repairs, a federal judge ruled last week..Judge Ian Johnston found enough support within the plaintiffs’ arguments, brought forth by the FTC and five other states alleging anticompetitive behavior, to deny Deere’s effort to end the lawsuit, according to a 27-page order filed June 10 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Western Division..The ruling clears the way for a trial expected to begin later this year, but a date has not been set yet. Deere sought to dismiss the complaint in March after claims were brought against the company in mid-January, during the end of the Biden administration..The FTC’s lawsuit stems from growing concerns that Deere and other original equipment manufacturers are restricting consumers’ ability and right to repair their own equipment..If Deere is found liable, the company may be forced to change its repair policies and make its resources more available to customers. .Apple, which faced lawsuits in California over consumers’ ability to repair their phones and electronics, has since taken steps to make the same parts, manuals and tools used at Apple stores also available to consumers. Last month, the company expanded its self-service program to include iPads, as well as previous models of Mac computers and iPhones..According to court documents, Deere allegedly drives up the cost of repairs and parts by forcing farmers to get their equipment serviced through its authorized dealer network rather than through independent shops, contractors and farmers. The dealers have exclusive access to an interactive software that can diagnose and fix tractor computer issues. .Another version of Deere’s software is accessible to independent parties, but the FTC argues the option is inferior and limited in scope..“Farmers have no alternatives because of the system created by Deere, which charges supracompetitive prices because of the lack of any alternatives,” Johnston wrote in his order, citing FTC’s allegations..Once farmers are in the door, the dealers can sell parts that are comparable to generic, cheaper versions, but higher in price. This behavior is unlawful, drives up farmer costs and yields “massive profits” for Deere and its dealers, the plaintiffs allege.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-must-face-ftc-repair-115800886.html,Regulatory and Reputation Risk  Reputation Risk  Potential Litigation Risk  Operational Risk

Despite the patriotic enthusiasm, there’s little evidence corporate America has broken ground on new domestic facilities..“There have been anecdotal announcements from drug companies, or otherwise, talking about investments here in the US,” Brent Thielman, who covers the construction and engineering industries for DA Davidson & Co., said in an interview. “But when that comes to fruition remains to be seen.”.Altogether, companies ranging from Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. to Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars of spending in the US since Trump’s election. Many of those commitments weren’t new or were in line with previous spending patterns..Touting new projects in response to tariffs could appear reactive, while highlighting projects already underway is a savvy way to calm investors in uncertain times, said Emily Borders, chief client officer at Highwire, a public relations agency..“It’s very difficult to set up a ‘Made in the USA’ program overnight. In fact, you can’t do that,” Borders said. “However, many organizations have been doing really interesting things in that regard or have had initiatives in that regard for a while and those may not have been top of mind with some of their constituencies.”.Like some of those investment announcements, touting your domestic production bona fides could have the added benefit of keeping the heat from the White House at bay, though that’s not a certainty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-create-most-patriotic-earnings-140000385.html,1.

Its momentum hasn’t stopped as it’s also gained 18.5% in the last six months thanks to its solid quarterly results, beating the S&P by 19%..Is now the time to buy Deere, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it’s free..We’re glad investors have benefited from the price increase, but we're cautious about Deere. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with DE and a stock we'd rather own..Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, Deere grew its sales at a sluggish 3.2% compounded annual growth rate. This fell short of our benchmark for the industrials sector..While long-term earnings trends give us the big picture, we also track EPS over a shorter period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business..Sadly for Deere, its EPS declined by more than its revenue over the last two years, dropping 17.8%. This tells us the company struggled to adjust to shrinking demand..As long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by..Deere’s $66.32 billion of debt exceeds the $9.26 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 6× net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $9.03 billion over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged..At this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company’s rating if profitability falls. Deere could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly – a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies..We hope Deere can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt..We cheer for all companies making their customers lives easier, but in the case of Deere, we’ll be cheering from the sidelines. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 26.6× forward P/E (or $520.65 per share). This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - you can find better investment opportunities elsewhere. We’d suggest looking at the Amazon and PayPal of Latin America.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-sell-1-stock-040348241.html,High Risk - Market Volatility and Overvaluation

Deere’s long-standing presence, investments and technological innovations are positioning it as a key enabler of the country’s rise as a global “agricultural superpower.”.Corn and soy account for 90% of Brazil’s total grain production. The country leads globally in cotton exports and ranks third in cotton production. Over the next decade, Brazil’s agricultural production is expected to surge, soybeans by 46%, corn by 50%, sugarcane by 20% and cotton by 38%, making it a strategic market for Deere..Expanding farming area by incorporating degraded, underutilized land and double cropping practices will aid this growth. While double cropping has productivity advantages, timing and precision are crucial to maximize yield and reduce production costs. This is where Deere’s precision solutions play a major role..Poor cell coverage is an issue in Brazil. Deere has been investing in partnerships and developing satellite-based solutions to enable real-time data and operations management. The company expects its connected machines to grow from 17 in 2020 to 200 by 2030..Over the past 25 years, Deere has made strategic investments in Brazil and currently has eight factories, four facilities and one R&D center. Its product portfolio has significantly diversified beyond the single soybean customer segment served in 2004..Over the 2009-2024 timeframe, Deere’s tractor market share in Brazil has almost doubled, the combine market has grown 1.5 times, planter market has increased 2.5 times and the sprayer market share has grown two times. The company’s $100 million expansion of its Catalão factory is enabling local SEE & SPRAY production. Deere also made its largest-ever product launch in Brazil at this year’s Agrishow..Deere’s strategic alignment with Brazil’s agricultural growth makes it a compelling investment story rooted in innovation, scale and long-term value creation. Over the past few years, players like AGCO Corporation AGCO and CNH Industrial CNH have also heightened their focus on the Brazilian market..CNH Industrial’s New Holland brand celebrated 50 years of supporting farmers in Brazil at Agrishow 2025.

According to Melius, Deere’s “full-stack” offering, integrating advanced hardware, sensors, software, and a strong dealer network, creates a formidable barrier for competitors..The analysts argue that these systems are already delivering measurable benefits for farmers and will become increasingly indispensable over time..While tech investors have yet to fully engage with Deere, Melius said the company is 5–10 years ahead in data capture and usage, aided by its Operations Center platform and a shift in farmer attitudes toward SaaS-like models. Connectivity improvements in rural areas, such as those enabled by Starlink, are also helping adoption..Beyond tech, Melius sees additional upside from Deere’s growing presence in Latin America, parts business, and potential for autonomy in smaller ag and construction..Risks include affordability for smaller farmers and uncertainty in how investors will ultimately value Deere’s recurring revenue streams. “Investors can forecast with high confidence that Deere will lead in ag tech, whether in 5 years or 15+,” the firm said..Related articles.Melius upgrades Deere on long-term tech moat and recurring revenue upside.Goldman Sachs initiates coverage on generic drugmakers, sees upside in Teva and Am.Morgan Stanley upgrades Applied Materials on derisked outlook for China",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/melius-upgrades-deere-long-term-153822915.html,Market Risk Company Risk Investment Risk

28,2025-06-05 01:01:00,Why Deere paid hackers $1.5 million to detect vulnerabilities and keep the agriculture-equipment maker safe,"James Johnson, chief information security officer at Deere & Co., says the 188-year-old agriculture-equipment maker has paid ethical hackers over $1.5 million for spotting vulnerabilities.","What keeps James Johnson up at night is the fear of a “one-to-many” attack, which would involve a bad actor uncovering a system vulnerability at Deere & Co. and in a nightmare scenario, take control of the company’s network of farming machinery..Though no such dire event has occurred, if it did, this type of hacking event would erode the hard-earned trust that Deere has cultivated over a 188-year history. “Our customers trust us a lot,” says Johnson, chief information security officer at Deere since 2014. “Our executives are laser focused on making sure we do the right things with data, as well as our equipment.”.To keep the manufacturer safe, Johnson deploys various strategies including “continuous attack surface management,” which constantly monitors a company’s digital footprint, and “pen testing,” a staged cyberattack to help uncover security vulnerabilities in a computer system..But Johnson is also quick to laud a Bug Bounty program that he established in 2022. The initiative has united Deere with HackerOne, a cybersecurity company that verifies researcher testers, who are empowered to examine Deere’s applications and network. When these researchers spot vulnerabilities before any bad actors are able to, they are entitled to compensation from Deere. Payouts vary on a sliding scale that’s based on the potential severity and risk of the security issue..Over the past three years, Deere has paid more than $1.5 million to the external researchers it works with to keep the company safe. Around 85 ethical hackers work with Deere as part of the program and Johnson predicts that number will rise to 150 by the end of 2025..The hackers report their findings to Deere’s internal team of cybersecurity researchers, who then assess each potential vulnerability. “Once we can validate it and get it fixed, they actually help us test it to make sure it’s fixed,” says Johnson..Due to the constant nature of change at a company, including how data is handled, Johnson says that new information is constantly at risk of being exposed. One example he shared was a directory of names and phone numbers that wasn’t intended to be made public. The researchers found it and flagged it to Deere, which was able to protect the information before a malicious individual could find it. “They found it very quickly and we were able to get it resolved,” says Johnson..Another area of focus for Johnson is promoting stronger cybersecurity skills at the collegiate level, which can bolster in-house expertise at Deere once those grads are ready to enter the workforce. “One of the hardest things we do in security is to find talent,” he says.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-deere-paid-hackers-1-170106754.html,Cyber Security Risk Reputation Risk Regulatory Risk Financial Risk Operational Risk

Corn prices have declined 3.9% year to date. Need for Food to Drive Industry Demand: Despite the ongoing volatility in commodity prices and lower crop receipts, agricultural equipment demand will continue to be supported by increased global demand for food, stemming from population growth and an increasing proportion of the population aspiring for better living standards. In the United States, the agricultural machinery market is forecast to reach $42.05 billion in 2025 and grow to $57.08 billion in 2030, seeing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%. With farm sizes increasing, there is a greater need for labor, but escalating labor costs are prompting farmers to turn to mechanization. Moreover, subsidies on agricultural machinery purchases are enabling even small-scale farmers to invest in equipment.Pricing, Cost-Cutting Actions to Boost Margins: The industry has not been immune to the rampant cost inflation prevailing in the sector. Constraints on the availability of raw materials, labor and trucking resources have led to higher lead times for deliveries. However, the industry players have recently been reporting improvements in the supply chain. The companies have been implementing pricing and cost-reduction actions, which are likely to help sustain margins.Technologically Advanced Machinery Gaining Popularity: Customers are increasingly relying on advanced technology, smart farming solutions and mechanization to run their operations. Thus, the industry participants are enhancing investments in launching products equipped with advanced technologies and features to keep up with customers' evolving demands. Precision agriculture technology is expected to be a key catalyst, as it enables farmers to increase yield with reduced input costs and sustainability benefits.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Deere (DE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this agricultural equipment manufacturer have returned +8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, to which Deere belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Deere is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of -25.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.8% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.82 points to a change of -26.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.08 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Deere is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.3%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Deere is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-deere-company-130014107.html,Market Sentiment Risk

Deere & Company (DE)'s share was trading at $507.99 as of 28th May. DE’s trailing and forward P/E were 24.54 and 27.62 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Pixabay/Public Domain.Deere & Company recently posted impressive quarterly results, beating both revenue and EPS expectations by double digits, with EPS surprises averaging 16% across nine of the last ten quarters. Despite being a cyclical business, Deere continues to outperform due to structurally higher profitability that the market may still be underestimating. The standout this quarter was an 18% operating margin—only 200 bps below levels seen when revenues were 19% higher—highlighting robust cost controls and favorable mix, even as the company remains near a cycle trough..Management maintained full-year margin guidance at 14.5%, despite strong results, citing cautious expectations around tariff impacts in H2. Deere is forecasting a return to sales growth in Q4 for the first time in nine quarters, hinting that the bottom of the ag cycle may already be behind us. Potential catalysts include a new Farm Bill and trade deals that could further support demand. Meanwhile, Deere continues aggressive buybacks—$2.4 billion over the past year—reducing share count by 4%, setting the company up for strong EPS growth driven by higher margins, revenue recovery, and fewer outstanding shares. On the call, management highlighted growing tariff headwinds, mostly affecting its construction division, but also emphasized long-term U.S. investment and a competitive edge via Deere's captive financing arm..Technologically, Deere is expanding its ag tech stack into construction and growing its SaaS footprint, with adoption and renewal rates supporting a long-term shift to recurring revenue. Despite trading near all-time highs, Deere’s strong fundamentals, margin resilience, and tech leadership suggest continued upside, with Brazil as a growing tailwind..For a comprehensive analysis of another standout stock covered by the same author, we recommend reading our summary of their bullish thesis on Danaher Corporation (DNH)..Deere & Company (DE) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 53 hedge fund portfolios held DE at the end of the first quarter which was 57 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of DE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

CEO John May explained that the company faced “historic levels of volatility and significant uncertainty across our end markets,” citing dynamic global trade conditions as a primary headwind. The company also faced incremental tariff expenses, with CFO Josh Jepsen noting that approximately $100 million in new tariff costs affected results this quarter. Despite these challenges, Deere’s operational execution, especially in production cost management and factory efficiency, helped offset some margin pressures. Management discussed how sequential sales growth and disciplined inventory management, particularly in North American large agriculture equipment, provided some stability amid a challenging demand environment..Looking ahead, Deere’s outlook is shaped by several persistent challenges, including fluid global trade policies, high interest rates, and cautious customer sentiment across agricultural and construction markets. Management emphasized the unpredictable nature of tariffs, estimating potential impacts of over $500 million for the year if current levels persist. Jepsen stated that Deere is “actively planning and executing mitigation strategies” but warned that most order books are already set, limiting pricing flexibility for the remainder of the year. Furthermore, the company sees continued pressure on equipment demand, especially in North America and Europe, although there are emerging signs of stabilization in South America and segments like precision agriculture. As Deere continues to invest in technology and integrated solutions, management believes these initiatives will be crucial in sustaining long-term competitiveness and margin resilience.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-earnings-call-deere-misses-191112456.html,Earnings Risk   Market Risk   Industry Risk

These 22 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early..Deere's recent dividend declaration signals a robust commitment to enhancing shareholder value, contrasting with the company's recent earnings report that showcased declines in sales and net income. Over the long-term, Deere has achieved a total shareholder return, including dividends, of 242.88% over the past five years. This considerable return reflects the company's ability to maintain value for its investors despite recent challenges..In comparison, Deere's recent performance has seen it outperform the US Machinery industry over the last year, which returned 7.3%, indicating resilience even amidst sector-specific challenges. The recent share price movement, with a 10.38% increase, narrows its discount to consensus analyst price targets, suggesting that current market enthusiasm aligns closely with analyst expectations..The news of Deere's strategic initiatives, like cost management and inventory adjustments, potentially impacts revenue and earnings forecasts. While revenues are forecasted to undergo a moderate annual decline of 0.5% over the next three years, earnings are expected to rise 12.3% per year. The adoption of precision agriculture technology, especially in Brazil, is anticipated to enhance these figures.

39,2025-05-28 17:00:00,This Unstoppable Dividend-Paying Growth Stock Is Up More Than 260% in 5 Years. Here's Why It Just Hit an All-Time High.,"Deere & Company stock leaped to a new all-time high after its earnings and forecast were good, given the challenging economic environment.  The equipment manufacturer continues to generate strong margins that support long-term growth.  Deere is raking in free cash flow to fuel stock buybacks and dividend increases.","Deere & Company stock leaped to a new all-time high after its earnings and forecast were good, given the challenging economic environment..The equipment manufacturer continues to generate strong margins that support long-term growth..Deere is raking in free cash flow to fuel stock buybacks and dividend increases..10 stocks we like better than Deere & Company ›.Shares of Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) hit an all-time high on May 16 after management reported second-quarter fiscal 2025 results (for the period ended April 27). Since then, the dividend stock has come down slightly from that high in lockstep with a broader market pullback..But shares of Deere, which manufactures agricultural equipment and other heavy-duty machinery, are still up 235% during the past five years compared to a less than 100% gain in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)..Buying stocks near all-time highs can seem counterintuitive. After all, everyone wants a good deal, which usually means paying less for something, not more..But investing in shares of a company is different from buying a product or service. Companies with a clear runway for growing earnings and delivering on shareholder expectations can still be worth investing in. Here's why Deere fits that mold..For latest quarter, the company reported net income of $1.8 billion, which was down 24% from to the same quarter in 2024 and 37% lower than the comparable 2023 quarter. Falling earnings usually cause a stock sell-off, not new all-time highs. So investors may be wondering why the reaction to the latest results has been so positive..Deere is a cyclical company whose earnings tend to ebb and flow based on various factors. When its end markets are thriving due to high crop prices, crop yields, or economic growth, then its customers may be more willing to boost their spending by expanding operations or upgrading their equipment. Management hopes that growth compounds over time so that each subsequent period of expansion is higher than the last, and each period of contraction isn't as bad. Deere's results reflect this pattern over time..As you can see in the chart, earnings didn't just expand -- they exploded, more than tripling from pre-pandemic highs at the peak. Even after the pullback, Deere's trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings are still more than double pre-pandemic highs. And the stock price reflects that earnings growth..In sum, the latest results only look bad compared to its comps from the last couple of years. The stock's valuation is still reasonable, with a 22.6 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unstoppable-dividend-paying-growth-stock-090000102.html,Economic Risk

While market trends have been consistent since 2020, demand has significantly weakened since the tractor boom of 2022..In response, equipment giants such as Deere & Co. and CNH Industrial have significantly cut their production output and laid off droves of manufacturing workers..Since March 2024, the John Deere tractor maker has laid off 1,866 people across its factories and offices in Iowa alone, as of February. Earlier this year, CNH notified workers at plants in North Dakota and Minnesota of 373 job cuts, citing “current and anticipated market conditions.”.Despite gloomy sales and projected tariff impacts across the industry, Deere executives were optimistic on a May earnings call about conditions improving this year. Chairman and CEO John May said the company saw sales momentum carry forward into the second quarter from the first quarter, citing $10 billion in federal emergency relief payments to farmers as a potential catalyst..Markets in Canada are already showing signs of recovery. Total tractor sales from January to April increased 3.4% over last year, according to AEM data for the country.

He has been making such threats since 2016.,"President Trump threatened Apple with 25% duties if it continues to manufacture iPhones overseas, the latest in a long list of company-specific tariff threats. Trump has a history of not following through on these warnings.","President Trump threatened Apple (AAPL) on Friday with 25% duties on overseas-made iPhones, the latest entry in a long list of company-specific tariff threats from the president stretching back to his first term in office..He also has a history of not following through on these warnings, often ending them with a claim of victory or by simply dropping the issue..Trump himself alluded to the frequency of his threats, writing Friday that he ""long ago informed [Apple CEO] Tim Cook"" of his position and his focus on iPhone manufacturing in India. The president added that not complying would take the form of a tariff that ""must be paid by Apple to the U.S."".The companies that Trump has singled out in a similar manner since his first administration range from John Deere (DE) to General Motors (GM) and others. He has also made previous threats against Apple dating back to 2016, even before he took office..""Companies like Apple will start making their iPhones and other products inside the United States,"" Trump promised that year when part of his first campaign's platform was 35% tariffs on companies if they move overseas..In recent weeks, Trump has also called out at least four other companies by name — Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Ford (F), and Mattel (MAT) — over the possibility that they could raise prices due to tariffs..The threats from Trump do have the ability to affect investor sentiment. Apple's stock fell more than 2% on Friday morning following Trump's warning, issued on Truth Social..In Apple’s case, in spite of Trump’s years of threats and the recent opening of new US Apple manufacturing facilities around AI and silicon engineering, no iPhones are currently made in the United States now, as in 2016, and that isn’t seen as likely to change anytime soon..Wedbush analyst Dan Ives quickly reacted to Trump’s threat by posting that a scenario of Apple acceding to Trump “would result in an iPhone price point [of ~$3,500 and] that is a non-starter for Cupertino."".He offered more details as to why in a note to investors, citing an “upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative.”.Also Friday morning, Trump announced he was ""recommending"" a 50% tariff on the European Union in a separate post that quickly drove down broader markets alongside the Apple broadside..Another company often in focus for Trump during his most recent presidential campaign was John Deere, with Trump last September promising a 200% tariff on the company over ""everything that you want to sell into the United States"" amid concerns that the company would move operations to Mexico.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-threatens-apple-with-tariffs-he-has-been-making-such-threats-since-2016-151849148.html,Global Trade Risk

Their capabilities and FieldAgent software tools help farmers and agronomists assess plant-level health, identify stressors, and take action. In addition, SMARTSCRIPT™ Weeds, a customized herbicide prescription, can be delivered to sprayers with individual nozzle control..Drones equipped with Sentera technology fly over fields at high speeds and generate high-resolution images. These images are processed with Sentera's FieldAgent application to identify the exact location of specific weeds and generate a weed map. This map becomes a targeted prescription for how much product a farmer needs to load into their sprayer, helping minimize waste. Once the prescription is generated, it can be wirelessly sent to compatible equipment through the John Deere Operations Center..Weed maps are just one example of actionable data that is enabled with Sentera scouting technology. The same process can be used in a field to assess crop stand uniformity, disease pressure, and pests. Integrating Sentera also supports John Deere's approach to meeting farmers where they are on the technology adoption journey.

They dipped today.","Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images.Shares of tractor and farm equipment maker Deere (DE) have been on a tear this year, recently touching record highs. They dipped today after an analyst suggested that maybe they needed to cool a bit..Deere stock ended Wednesday near $515, down some 2% on the day. In the rear-view mirror, that doesn't look like so much: The shares are up more than 20% this year, aided lately by quarterly profits, reported earlier this month, that came in better than expected..Today's slip, which came as broader markets fell, was perhaps influenced by a report from BMO analysts, who have a neutral ""market perform"" rating on the shares..BMO lifted its price target by $35 to $460, but that's the lowest of any tracked by Visible Alpha, where the mean close to $553 is about $38 higher than today's close, and it would mean a return to prices last seen at the start of this month. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.).Wall Street expects Deere's revenue to fall for the current fiscal year, according to Visible Alpha, then post modest year-over-year growth in the next one..""We aren't yet convinced growers will broadly return to make large capital purchases for some time,"" the analysts wrote. ""We remain neutral at current valuation, thinking the stock has run ahead a little early."".Read the original article on Investopedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deeres-stock-hot-lately-took-203907073.html,Market Risk Financial Risk Investment Risk

Capital gains are when investors get rewarded for a company's stock compounding in value, whereas dividends are when a company distributes a portion of its corporate profits directly to shareholders..Companies with growing dividends that also have a stock compounding in value over time can help investors achieve their passive income and long-term financial goals..Three Motley Fool contributors were asked to outline why Deere (NYSE: DE), Cheniere Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE: CQP), and Sunoco L.P. (NYSE: SUN) are three dividend stocks that can continue outperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) beyond 2025..Daniel Foelber (Deere): Deere leaped to a new all-time high on May 16 after reporting second-quarter fiscal 2025 results..At first glance, the move higher may come as a surprise, given Deere's worldwide net sales fell 16% year over year and net income was down 24%. It also widened the low end of its full-year net income guidance from a prior range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion to a new range of $4.75 billion to $5.5 billion. But investors may have been expecting even worse results, given global tariff tensions and economic uncertainty..Deere notched an 18.8% margin on equipment operations during the quarter -- which was better than expected, given cost pressures. On the earnings call, Deere management said that incremental tariff headwinds during the quarter were $100 million and that it expects a full fiscal year pre-tax tariff impact of just over $500 million if current tariff levels persist..There are a few ways to digest this news. The negative is that tariffs are impacting Deere's bottom line. But the impact would be much worse if Deere didn't manufacture so many of its products in the U.S. (and source the majority of its components from U.S. suppliers). So the company is well-positioned to handle tariffs compared to companies with more globalized supply chains..Additionally, basic math tells us that without the tariff impact, Deere may have actually raised its full-year guidance, which is a testament to its strong results despite weakness in several end markets.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-monster-dividend-stocks-111500570.html,Market Risk Market Sentiment Risk High Investment Risk Company Acquisition Risk

The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving revenues. The company expects net revenues to grow in high-single to low-double digits in fiscal 2025. Visa, fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, Visa’s elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect adjusted operating expenses to rise 9.5% year over year in fiscal 2025. The company is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Hence, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9% vs. -5%). The company beat Q1 estimates for earnings but missed on sales. Its key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, and Fasenra should keep driving revenues. AstraZeneca’s pipeline is strong, with pivotal late and mid-stage pipeline data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. However, potentially lower sales of Lynparza and Farxiga in China, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology sales and slowing sales of rare disease drugs are expected to hurt the top line in 2025. (You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here >>>)Shell’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the year-to-date period (+8% vs. -1.3%). The company, being the largest oil firm in Europe, has solid fundamentals, and the stock looks fairly balanced at the moment. London-based Shell plc remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Shell leverages its strong LNG position, bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel. Strategic moves like the Equinor JV and Pavilion Energy acquisition also support long-term growth. However, a few red flags keep the outlook in check: Q1 revenue missed by $10B, chemical margins remain weak, and reserve replacement continues to lag. Add macro risks, delayed earnings impact from new projects, and ongoing pressure from the energy transition, and the near-term setup feels mixed. For now, investors may prefer to wait for a better entry point before buying Shell shares.(You can read the full research report on Shell here >>>)Shares of Ocean Power Technologies have outperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past year (+202.3% vs. +42.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $90.50 million offers strong revenue visibility with a record $7.5 million backlog, driven by global demand for its AI-enabled PowerBuoy and WAM-V platforms across defense and commercial sectors. Financial discipline is evident as cash burn fell 41% and liquidity rose to $10.2 million. Ocean Power Technologies shift to a recurring revenue model (DaaS/RaaS) enhances margin potential and customer stickiness. Advanced autonomous systems support long-duration maritime ops with minimal oversight, addressing needs in defense, energy, and environmental monitoring. However, risks include persistent losses ($15.1 million YTD), liquidity concerns, high client concentration, and dilution from equity financing. Products remain in early commercialization, and governance issues plus emerging market exposure introduce further uncertainty. OPTT's growth potential is clear, but execution and financial sustainability remain critical watchpoints.(You can read the full research report on Ocean Power Technologies here >>>)Wheeler Real Estate Investment’s shares have underperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry over the past year (-99.9% vs. +11.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $3.32 million have equity value is pressured by dilution from preferred redemptions and stock splits, and liquidity has tightened, with $489 million in debt and a decline in cash to $19.2 million. Legal overhang, weakening NOI, and declining Cedar leasing trends signal operational headwinds. Despite a high implied Series D dividend yield, risks from asset erosion, derivative liabilities and regional concentration constrain long-term upside. Despite ongoing challenges, WHLR’s valuations offer a potential value opportunity relative to its historical norms and industry peers.Nevertheless, Wheeler Real Estate has improved its balance sheet via $13 million in Series D Preferred redemptions and $18.3 million in asset sales, reducing leverage and generating $5.7 million in net gains. Occupancy remains strong at 93.3%, with leasing spreads reinforcing pricing power.(You can read the full research report on Wheeler Real Estate Investment here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Deere & Company (DE), Roper Technologies, Inc.

First up, let's talk about Dicks sporting goods. It is buying Foot Locker in a $2.4 billion deal aimed at expanding international reach and boosting Foot Locker's digital presence. The deal has shares of Foot Locker soaring today, Dicks going down by quite a lot here. Now, you tend to see an acquirer dinged. But there are a lot of questions from analysts about this deal and whether it was the right one for Dicks. Foot Locker has been struggling to some extent. Some analysts saying Dicks has been on good footing, and they're really questioning whether this is the time to make this deal. .Yeah, I saw, I think it was city here, uh, saying Dicks is proven operator. They do say Foot Locker has opportunity to be run better, says they could have, uh, more buying power with key brands combined, have around, looks here around 30% of Nike's wholesale business. I also saw analysts at Bloomberg weighing in. Foot Locker's in the midst, they say of a challenging turnaround. It needs the buyout from Dicks versus the other way around, validated, they say by week preliminary Q1 results for Foot Locker, a contrast, they say to Dickspeat. .Yeah, I also thought it was interesting Jonathan Comp over at Berard saying that this deal is a leveraged bet on Nike's turnaround. As we've talked about in the past, Foot Locker is very overindexed to the likes of a Nike, and that relationship has sort of, uh, been hot and cold over the past couple of years as Nike sort of went with a more direct to consumer strategy, then came back around to using Foot Locker as a channel. So it's going to be real interesting, and we're going to talk more about this with Sam Poser, who's longtime footwear analyst later in the show. .Sam. Sam is the man to talk to on this story, for sure. Shares of Deere hitting an all-time high. That's after topping earnings expectations. The earnings beat comes even as profits fell 22 versus 22% compared to the same period last year. So, uh, beat estimates. Net income did drop 22% for the year earlier to 664 a share, but the street expected 557. So that's good enough. They did trim their profit outlook for the year. They're now looking for between 4.75 and 5.5 billion. .Yeah, basically the shares are trading at a record. Did you say that already? Forgive me if you did. The shares are The shares are in a record. Um, and it seems like there's a lot of optimism about the farm cycle sort of inflecting higher from here. Um, over at Jeffries, there was an analyst there who said, we see nothing in today's results that calls into question the thesis that 2025 should mark a bottom in the egg cycle. So it's as much about today as it is about that sort of view that things are going to get better from here. .And I see analysts at City Citi say, less dire than feared tariff impact outlook. So less dire, that's good enough, too. .Yeah, and the shares up about 20% this year. Uh, Corweve getting a boost today after regulatory filings showed an additional agreement with Open AI in which the chat GPT maker has committed to pay Corweve up to $4 billion through April 2029. It also comes after the company issued its first earnings report since going public via an IPO in March. Now the shares initially fell, then this filing came out. They went up. It looks like they're back down again. I don't know if we got that intraday chart to show that sort of back and forth that we've been seeing in the shares today. There it is. So you saw the shares initially down, then up, then down again. I mean, there was this optimism around this deal. There was already an existing agreement here. Corweve had, um, already signed with Open AI a five-year contract worth about $12 billion. So this is then an additional $4 billion on top of that. But the company's operating income forecast was below estimates. .Uh, so that Corweve disclosed a deal in the earnings call yesterday, but then didn't name the party. So now now we know. Uh, by the way, Brentilla Jeffries telling his clients, we know Brent, friend of the show, longtime smart analyst. He says, we see no sign of AI compute tail winds easing up soon and see Corweve as a multi-year winner. He took his target to, it looks like 80. Well, .But then on the flip side of that, we got DA Davidson cutting it to underperform from neutral. Its price target Is that I'm not sure if it's gonna As I'm reading this, I'm not I'm not sure if it's Gil, but the price target there is 36. We are fans. So who do choose your fighter? Um, Whoever I I'm gonna check it, but whoever said it says they conf it confirms our concern that Corweve is not a business worth scaling. .So All right. It does.

59,2025-05-16 03:08:00,Deere's slump shows the real economy is slowing down,"Big tractors, big signals.","Big tractors, big signals..In company earnings released early Thursday, Deere (DE) – the agriculture and construction giant known for its John Deere brand – posted a 16% decline in revenue and a 24% drop in profit for the quarter, with its most important segment, Production & Precision Ag, down 21% from last year. Construction equipment was also hit hard, with that division’s profit plunging 43%..The company’s outlook was dim, too. In North America, Deere now expects sales of large-scale farm equipment to fall around 30% this year..But this isn’t a case of a company-specific stumble. It’s a picture of what happens when farmers, builders, and global buyers pull back on spending, and it’s what you have to expect from a goods-producing economy at last running out of post-COVID momentum while also feeling the drag of higher capital costs. Deere’s core customers are closing their wallets as interest rates remain high, grain prices weaken, and construction demand cools off..Adding to the mix is a tough foreign-exchange environment for the ag giant. Deere reports in U.S. dollars, so the weakening USD is hurting its margins from overseas sales and operations. In keeping, the company flagged currency headwinds across all major business lines..Still, Deere remains a dominant force; it’s the largest farm equipment maker in the world, with a stunning 79% of its U.S. “complete goods” sourced domestically. It’s also a beloved brand, embedded in contemporary brainspace well outside farming communities and construction circles via an absolutely constant stream of “save a few bucks” Netflix (NFLX) commercials..The latest economic indicators, also released Thursday, echo Deere’s warning that the physical economy is slowing down. April’s surprise drop in the Producer Price Index (PPI) — down 0.5% month-over-month — suggests businesses are absorbing cost pressures rather than passing them along, a trend that compresses margins in capital-intensive sectors like ag and construction..It makes sense that we’d see the strain show up here first. Capital equipment and commodities tend to be early indicators of slowdowns, precisely because they sit early in the business cycle. When farmers and builders hit pause on big-ticket purchases, it often flags that broader demand is cooling, too, though more direct evidence can take longer to show up..Similarly, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, while less bleak than last month, continues to suggest that industrial activity is contracting.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deeres-slump-shows-real-economy-181600879.html,1.

Despite these declines, the company's stock price has risen 7% over the last quarter, aligning with broader gains in major indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500. This positive movement might suggest that investors have confidence in Deere's ability to navigate current challenges, such as inventory and cost management, while benefiting from improved farmer sentiment and technology adoption in markets like Brazil..Over the past five years, Deere's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, reached a substantial 273.65%. In comparison, the company's performance over the last year has outpaced both the US market and the Machinery industry average. Specifically, Deere exceeded the US market's 10.6% return and the Machinery industry's 1.6% return, underscoring its resilience in a competitive landscape..Looking ahead, Deere's revenue and earnings forecasts may be impacted by high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainties, but the company's cost management strategies and reduced inventories should enhance its financial health.

Davidson managing director of equity research, Michael Shlisky, joins Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief to discuss the earnings print and examine the impact of tariffs..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..Deer trimming the lower end of its annual profit forecast due to none else than tariff uncertainty. Still the agricultural and construction equipment maker topping second-quarter expectations, the shares up over four percent. Joining us now, Michael Shlisky, DA Davidson Equity Research Managing Director. Great to have you on Michael. It's interesting. It seems like the worst being avoided for this stock in terms of the gut, in terms of the guidance is enough to lift it this morning. What's your reaction? .Yeah, that's uh that's exactly right. Sure, they did take down the low end of the full-year range for their net income. At the same time, they did maintain their operating cash flow outlook, didn't change that at all. And most of the downside it is some of the different statements, but most of it appears to be the smaller end of the of discussions, some of the smaller ag equipment items and not the large tractors and and combines. That seems mostly unchanged. .And so, as you're looking through these results, I mean, we're taking a look at some significant declines in net sales and revenue at least year-over-year. So, how are you kind of assessing what the business opportunities look like from this point and and if that makes Deere investable or not? .Well, I would say that there are two things going on there for the pretty big downturn on on the top line. First of all, Deere is still trying to reduce inventories in the distribution channel to make sure that when things do get better or get at least flatten out on the at the bottom that their inventories are fresh, they are clean, they're not going to be discounted heavily. And so, they are underperforming the retail sales. In other words, they are building a lot less than they're selling in the actual dealerships. Um so that's the that's the um, that's the uh, the first part of it. If you look at what dealership activity actually took place in the, in the second quarter, it shows that sales were actually down only about 7.5%. So, to have their numbers down 15, 20% for the year, they're clearly trying to to clear out inventory. The second thing beyond that's going to come down to the current crop addition. Can the weather hold up in what's, what's just going to put in the ground in the Corn Belt? Will we see a drought? Will we see a, um, a flood, etc.? Those kinds of issues are going to be very important through the end of August. .Yeah, and I can't believe we haven't talked about the tariff impact on those crops at all as well because this is something when we talked to farmers on our program that they cite as a huge concern for them, and of course, it's a concern for income of a company like Deere relying on farmers buying equipment from them. But the company did say in these results that they took into account any potential tariff impact. Do you believe them? .Yes. Um in fact, the impact is a little bit less than you might think. Everyone has to eat, and that's globally. Doesn't matter what country you're in. And so, while yes, tariffs could affect the farmers here in the United States, that would be a, a tough thing to bear. Um somebody else in a different region is going to benefit. Their crops are going to be in more demand because folks can't starve. And so, it sounds like if, let's say, China starts to import less US soybeans, they'll just get more from South America. Deere sells plenty of tractors there. They'll have no issue with growth in that, in that, you know, region instead. So in that respect, ag is a little bit different than most other end markets out there. .Michael, as I'm taking a look at some of the industry outlook and across geographies right now, two areas really stick out, and it's South America. They're anticipating that that is essentially going to be flat in their unit sales. And then also flat unit sales in Asia. What do you take away from that? Knowing how much they want to invest further into their relationships and their pipeline in South America, I believe they have their investor day in Brazil coming forward in June. And then additionally in Asia, where as of right now, in the middle of a geopolitical tension-filled moment and environment, is there a headwind to selling US-born equipment into that region and some of the mind-share sentiment? .Yeah, sure. Um in South America, especially in, in Brazil, you pretty much have to make the machine in the same place in which you sell it. So in Brazil, Deere has a full manufacturing footprint there, and they sell mostly within South America. It's the most rapidly growing area of the world as far as crop acreage for corn, for soybeans, etc. They're even adding in an additional season per year if they, if they can of additional crops. So it's important that, that Deere that they grow there. As I mentioned, some of the uncertainties from a tariff perspective between the US and China, two major, you know, growers and buyers of the, of the crop. The third place is Brazil, and they very well may end up being a medium to long-term winner here. As far as Asia goes, they like to oftentimes go by the strong brand name. There's not a stronger brand name in ag than Deere. So, I'm not surprised to see that, you know, Deere is trying to consolidate market share and grow in these faster-growing areas. .What's going to happen to this stock the next time the president makes it a talking point? Obviously, it came up a lot on the campaign trail. How concerned are you about that happening again and the volatility that may cause in the price action? .Yeah, I mean, it's going to be, that's going to be interesting. When you look back, what's happened in the past when you had tariffs back in 2017, 2018, farmers got supported by the USDA in, in, in the end. There were some special payments made to help support their incomes. Mostly, it's kind of shore up balances. They probably won't be used to go down to the store and buy the latest tractor, but it does help farmers. Uh it seems like the government, both parties have a strong interest in keeping farming viable, thriving here in the US. A little bit about difference in the policy as to how they get there. But it does seem like there's a pretty, pretty strong support. And if things get truly, truly bad, there there could be additional support given.

In profitability and cash flow terms, manufacturers typically see their margins shrink during periods of weak demand, and that's been the case for Deere.","Deere is working through a downturn in demand for its equipment in almost every end market and geography..Sales and earnings are down, but the company continues to deliver solid operating results..Management expanded the lower end of its full-year earnings outlook, but held firm on cash flows and the upper end of profits..10 stocks we like better than Deere & Company ›.Here's our initial take on Deere & Co.'s (NYSE: DE) fiscal 2025 second-quarter financial results..Metric.Q2 FY24.Q2 FY25.Change.vs. Expectations.Revenue.$15.2 billion.$12.8 billion.-16%.Beat.Earnings per share.$8.53.$6.64.-22%.Beat.Operating margin.20.3%.18.1%.- 220 bps.n/a.Operating cash flow (six months).$944 million.$568 million.-40%.n/a.The equipment and engine manufacturer's second quarter saw more double-digit sales declines, and as is typical for many cyclical businesses, it reported an even larger earnings decline. Yet some signs indicated the worst of this cyclical downturn could be behind it. While revenue was down 16% and earnings per share fell 22%, that was a moderation from the 30% and 49% respective declines in the first quarter, which was a deterioration from the fourth quarter of the prior year, when revenue fell 28% and earnings per share were down 45%..In profitability and cash flow terms, manufacturers typically see their margins shrink during periods of weak demand, and that's been the case for Deere. The good news is that gross margins are holding up, at 40.3% from 39.9% last year. Operating margin did fall 220 basis points (2.2 percentage points) to 18.1%, a relatively solid result considering the impact of lost revenue. In all, Deere was able to bring its costs and expenses down almost $1.7 billion in the quarter..Deere share prices were up around 2.3% in premarket trading today, a notable gain against a backdrop of broad market futures down about a half a percentage point. Deere's results, while worse than a year ago, show that trend of stabilization and came in ahead of expectations. Management's guidance across most of its segments is for revenue declines to stabilize and Deere to deliver strong full-year earnings and cash flow..Deere is guiding for revenue to fall 15% to 20% in its production and precision ag segment, which is its largest, but for 10% to 15% declines in its other segments, which make up about 60% of total sales. This supports the likelihood that even with continued soft sales, the trend suggests it's at the bottom of the cycle and showing some signs of a recovery in growing demand within a few quarters.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-delivers-solid-results-downturn-135420001.html,Economic Risk  Operational Risk  Market Risk  Financial Risk

Shares of Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) climbed as much as 8% on Monday before falling back to up 5%, while shares of Toro (NYSE: TTC) and Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE) were up as much as 5%. Deere gave some of that gain back late in the day and was up just 1% as of 3:30 p.m. ET..Cat, Deere, and Toro are three of the premier global names in the manufacture of heavy duty equipment used in construction, mining, agriculture, and lawn care. They were seen as vulnerable to tariffs in two ways: They both rely on raw materials that are often imported and look to markets like China as a valuable source of sales..Cat shares traded down as much as 35% for the year immediately following the early April tariff announcements, and Toro and Deere shares also traded down significantly. The companies also must worry about the secondary impact of tariffs. Deere could lose agriculture equipment sales due to tariffs on farm output, for example, and Toro could lose lawn equipment sales if the consumer falters because of higher costs..Headlines from over the weekend are sparking a relief rally in the stocks. China and the U.S. don't have a finalized deal yet, but they appear to be making progress in resolving their differences. All three of these companies can weather some impact due to tariffs, but investors are eager to avoid a prolonged slowdown..The market is moving in the right direction, but investors have ample reason to be cautious..Even before the early April ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, there were concerns about a potential economic slowdown which could eat into demand for the high-priced equipment these companies sell. And initial reports suggest that tariffs between China and the U.S. will be lowered but not disappear, suggesting there could be a long-term drag on earnings from here..These are three top operators, but they are also businesses that are boxed in by the health of their end markets. Investors can do well investing in these sorts of cyclical stocks, but they need to be patient.

While the company is seeing strong demand from product launches, elevated production expenses and low commodity prices are anticipated to have marred the gains..Low Commodity Prices & Shipment Volumes: Deere has been facing challenges due to weak farmer spending amid low commodity prices. In the wake of challenging conditions in the global agricultural and construction sectors, DE has been aligning its production with demand levels. The company has, thus, been reporting lower shipment volumes in the past few quarters and this is likely  to have weighed on the company’s fiscal second-quarter performance as well.Higher Expenses: High production expenses; selling, administrative and general expenses; and research and development expenses are likely to have impacted the company’s margin in the quarter.Favorable Pricing: Deere is assessing its cost structure by reviewing organizational efficiency and footprint assessment, which, in turn, will help improve margins. Its price realization action is expected to offset higher material and freight costs. Favorable price realization is expected to have negated some of these headwinds, as seen in the previous quarters..Our model predicts the Production &  Precision Agriculture segment’s revenues to be $4.61 billion for the fiscal second quarter, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 23.9%. We expect the segment’s operating profit to be $619 million, indicating a 62.5% fall from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Gains from price realization are likely to have been offset by escalated production expenses and lower shipment volumes.Our estimate for the Small Agriculture &  Turf segment’s revenues is pegged at $2.78 billion for the fiscal second quarter, indicating a 12.6% decline from the prior-year quarter’s actual. The segment’s operating profit is estimated at $485 million, suggesting a 15.1% year-over-year fall. The Small Agriculture &  Turf segment’s performance is expected to have been affected by elevated production expenses; higher research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses; and lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization.The Construction &  Forestry segment’s sales are estimated to be $3.29 billion for the fiscal second quarter, suggesting a 14.4% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported number on lower volume. We predict the segment’s operating profit to plunge 12% year over year to $588 million.Our estimate for the Financial Services segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.48 billion for the fiscal second quarter, indicating a 6.7% rise from the year-ago quarter’s actual.

Energy Transfer is a cash-gushing pipeline and infrastructure MLP with growth prospects under the Trump administration.  Huntington Ingalls is a defense contractor that reported a great start to 2025 and expects a strong performance for the rest of the year.,"Deere is worth buying if you can endure its cyclicality..Energy Transfer is a cash-gushing pipeline and infrastructure MLP with growth prospects under the Trump administration..Huntington Ingalls is a defense contractor that reported a great start to 2025 and expects a strong performance for the rest of the year..10 stocks we like better than Deere & Company ›.The broader stock market indexes have been on a tear in recent weeks, fueled by a rally in megacap growth stocks. But plenty of dividend stocks have also joined the party, like Deere (NYSE: DE), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII)..All three stocks are up big in the last month. Here's why they are still worth buying in May..Daniel Foelber (Deere): Heavy machinery giant Deere has stood out in the beaten-down industrial sector. The shares are up more than 16% year to date at the time of this writing. The recent surge is likely due to investor optimism about easing trade tensions. But Deere isn't out of the woods just yet..A prolonged period of tariffs could hurt demand for Deere's products, raise Deere's costs, and throw a wrench in global trade. An economic slowdown would leave Deere's customers with less cash. When the economy is expanding and interest rates are low, Deere's customers are more likely to boost their capital expenditures on long-term investments -- like expensive machinery. So Deere is a great buy for investors hoping the U.S. avoids a recession..Still, Deere has a lot to prove when it reports earnings on May 15. When Deere reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 results in February (ended Jan. 26), trade tensions had yet to heat up. The company booked just $869 million in first-quarter net income but forecast full-year net income of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Compared to first quarter 2024, revenue fell 30% and net income was down 50%. If that trend continues, Deere will miss its full fiscal year projection..On its February earnings call, Deere said it expects pricing pressures in the second quarter, but that those pressures could ease in the second half of 2025 for certain segments. Deere also faces easier comps against the second half of fiscal 2024 -- which was weak. So the year-over-year comparisons likely won't be as drastic in the second half of this year, even if the results are poor..It's also worth understanding that Deere has been experiencing a multiyear slowdown after sales and earnings soared after the pandemic. Its stock price has continued to climb even while sales and earnings have tumbled, which has pushed up Deere's valuation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-red-hot-dividend-stocks-094500862.html,1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against other best agriculture stocks to buy now..On April 28, CNBC reported that while other US sectors are nearing what President Trump’s Treasury secretary Scott Bessent calls “an unsustainable tariff war”, the American farming sector has started to bear the effects of the economic crisis, with the damage already done. American agricultural exporters believe that the global backlash to tariffs imposed by Trump is punishing them, especially through a decrease in Chinese purchasing of US products. This trend is resulting in canceled export orders and layoffs..Data from the US Department of Agriculture shows that China canceled its biggest pork orders since 2020, stopping the shipment of 12,000 tons of pork. CNBC reported that Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC), a leading export trade group for farmers, opined that calling the number of canceled orders of US agricultural products could not be called “approaching a crisis”, as “it is a full-blown crisis already.”.AgTC also reported that its members are experiencing “massive” financial losses because of the trade war, based on the reports sent by member companies. A wood pulp and paperboard reported to AgTC the hold or immediate cancellation of 6,400 metric tons in a warehouse. It said that 9,000 metric tons of the product are already on their way to China through water, with the estimated arrival time being May 13. Chinese buyers may refuse to accept these shipments and abandon them at the port, which is why the threat of costly diversion to Chinese or other bonded warehouses looms over the journey..READ ALSO: Recession Resistant Investing: 10 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Now and 11 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Hedge Funds..China-to-US vessel traffic has also seen a steep decline.

88,2025-05-08 22:00:00,Analysts Estimate Deere (DE) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Deere (DE) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,"The market expects Deere (DE) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates..The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 15, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise..This agricultural equipment manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.4%..Revenues are expected to be $10.65 billion, down 21.8% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-deere-report-decline-140010865.html,Market Risk
89,2025-05-07 21:30:00,Is It Worth Investing in Deere (DE) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,"Based on the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), Deere (DE) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Deere (DE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Deere currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy..Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 47.6% and 4.8% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Deere here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Deere, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-deere-based-wall-133011091.html,"Financial Market Risk, Market Sentiment Risk"

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Deere (DE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this agricultural equipment manufacturer have returned +15.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +10.6% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, to which Deere belongs, has gained 11.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Deere is expected to post earnings of $5.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%..The consensus earnings estimate of $18.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.3%. This estimate has changed -2.1% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.17 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Deere is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Deere.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-deere-company-buy-130014485.html,Market Risk: High Company Risk: Medium Regulatory Risk: Low Reputation Risk: Low Macroeconomic Risk: Medium Operational Risk: Low Systemic Risk: Medium Idiosyncratic Risk: Medium Credit Risk: Low

The company's earnings report is set to go public on May 15, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Deere to post earnings of $5.68 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 33.41%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $10.65 billion, reflecting a 21.75% fall from the equivalent quarter last year..For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $18.91 per share and revenue of $38.23 billion, which would represent changes of -26.19% and -14.59%, respectively, from the prior year..Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Deere. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook..Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system..The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against other hidden AI stocks..David Grain, Founder & CEO of Grain Management, joined CNBC on May 1 to discuss the AI-driven demand for data centers and tariff uncertainty. The main concerns regarding tariffs are the potential impact on costs, the resilience of supply chains, and the overall effect on business operations and their expansion. He also shared his perspective on why investors are still confident in the broadband and digital infrastructure sector. He characterized broadband as universally essential and emphasised that the demand for faster connectivity has not slowed, which is why the regulatory support for broadband expansion is globally robust. Grain noted that the administration has also met expectations for lighter regulation in the infrastructure sector, which makes it easier to advance projects and close deals. He described the admin’s stance as pro-growth and supportive of secure and competitive networks. Grain also observed that infrastructure, especially broadband, is an area where there is bipartisan support, given its positive impact on economic growth at both the state and local levels..DeepSeek’s announcement was also followed by reports that suggested that some companies might be pulling back on data center spending. However, the latest earnings reports appeared to settle at least this debate and confirmed that the investments in this sector were still ongoing. David Grain elaborated on the current trends in data center investments and also stated that the demand for data centers is rising due to the increasing expansion of AI, as it requires vast amounts of computing power. He explained that while the demand here is not slowing, the feasibility of building new data centers is still influenced by the availability of reliable and high-capacity electricity..We sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of the top hidden AI stocks with AI-related operations and opportunities. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024..Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .Farm equipment manufacturers CNH Industrial and Agco Corp. reported sales declines of 23% and 30% in their first quarters, respectively, over last year, underscoring an economic slowdown across agriculture sectors..As customers pulled back on spending, net incomes plummeted last quarter for CNH and Agco — down 64% and 95% YoY, respectively, according to their latest earnings reports. Both companies have made significant efforts to cut production and help realign dealer inventories with slow demand..While equipment demand has likely reached its low point for the year, geopolitical and trade uncertainties related to tariffs could encourage a “wait-and-see” approach to spending among customers as costs continue to rise, CNH CEO Gerrit Marx said on an earnings call last week..Demand for tractors, combines and other heavy equipment has been weak since late 2022, as farmers struggle with lower incomes and higher input costs, squeezing their capacity to make big upgrades and purchases..This trend has carried through the first months of the year and is expected to continue through 2025, company executives said during their earnings calls, as CNH and Agco evaluate the short- and long-term effects of tariffs on their operations..“We will continue to monitor the rapidly changing tariff policies and implement pricing actions or supply chain adjustments where it makes sense and is feasible,” Agco CEO Eric Hansotia said on a call Thursday..Agco, based in Duluth, Georgia, is unique in that much of its manufacturing takes place outside of the United States, including in France, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Finland and China, according to an investor filing. This exposure could open the company to more tariff-related risks than its competitors..Comparatively, CNH, based in the United Kingdom, has operations around the world, but a significant manufacturing footprint in the U.S, with two-thirds of its goods sourced from U.S. factories, according to a Q1 presentation. Meanwhile, more than 75% of Deere & Co’s products sold in the U.S. are assembled domestically..Typically, U.S. farmers expect federal support payments to act as a buffer when tariffs threaten global trade and commerce. This has kept farmer sentiment stable in the past, however, Marx said he is unsure if the same is true for this year..“We might only see more clearly after the summer where and when demand is coming back,” Marx said on the call.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-makers-cnh-agco-face-110000454.html,- Market risk - Industry risk - Operational risk - Economic risk

How should investors respond to this development?","Caterpillar Inc.’s CAT recently reported first-quarter 2025 results were not impressive, with the mining and construction equipment behemoth witnessing year-over-year declines in its top and bottom lines, and falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported volume declines across all its segments. The first quarter marked CAT’s fifth consecutive quarter of a revenue decline and the third straight quarter of earnings decline..Despite the weak performance, CAT shares have risen 2% since the results, thanks in part to a record $5-billion sequential increase in backlog to $35 billion. Also, despite the tepid results, Caterpillar has not drastically slashed its projections for the full year..The company expects 2025 revenues to be “roughly flat” with the 2024 actual, when excluding tariffs, slightly better than earlier projections. Including tariffs, revenues are expected to decline slightly, unchanged from the previous guidance..Despite the uptick, the CAT stock has moved down 13.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 10% growth. In comparison, the Zacks Industrial Products sector has declined 8.7%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has risen 5.7%.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .Meanwhile, Caterpillar’s peers Deere & Company DE and Komatsu KMTUY have fared better, with year-to-date gains of 13.3% and 4.7%.

Earnings per share were $4.25, 24% lower than the year-ago quarter..All three segments — Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and the Energy and Transportation segment reported lower volumes in the quarter.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)..Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Deere is:.28% = US$6.2b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2025)..The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit.. Check out our latest analysis for Deere .One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Deere has a higher ROE than the average (14%) in the Machinery industry..That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk..Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same..Deere clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.88. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impressed-deere-companys-nyse-roe-140018584.html,Financial Risk   Company-specific risk  Market risk  No liquidity risk  No credit risk  No operational risk

Over the past 30 years, Bill and Melinda have contributed an estimated $47.7 billion of their fortune to their foundation and predecessor. The foundation's trust maintains a highly concentrated equities portfolio, reflecting the influence of Bill Gates and his longtime friend and former foundation trustee, Warren Buffett..The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has set a record $8.74 billion budget for 2025, with intentions to increase yearly distributions to $9 billion the following year. Mark Suzman, the foundation's CEO, stated that the record approval by its governing council is consistent with the foundation's goal of a world ""where everyone, everywhere, deserves the chance to live a healthy, productive life."".Previously regarded as an aspect of science fiction, AI appears to have entered ordinary life and is now finding its way to consumers and businesses.

The Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, to which Deere belongs, has lost 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Deere is expected to post earnings of $5.68 per share, indicating a change of -33.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.91 points to a change of -26.2% from the prior year.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .As manufacturers look to adopt the latest artificial intelligence and automated technologies to drive efficiency on the shop floor and remain competitive, one of the biggest challenges is convincing their workers that the changes are a good idea..Today’s U.S. workforce is more worried than hopeful about future AI use — about a third of those surveyed recently by the Pew Research Center say it will lead to fewer job opportunities in the long run..Manufacturing leaders convened at the North American Manufacturing Excellence Summit in Fort Worth, Texas, last week to discuss their strategies around how to quell anxieties and job security concerns. This includes tactics such as as implementing technologies that expedite tedious tasks and processes, like picking up parts or distilling hundreds of pages of business documents..In some cases, the technology has even opened up the possibility for factories to operate shifts without human supervision, allowing for a shorter work week..Here are some examples of how manufacturers are incorporating AI, automation and robotics to not only boost productivity, but to improve company culture and help workers upskill for the future..Heather Bishop, global director of manufacturing and operations at John Deere Power Systems, said during the manufacturing conference that the farm equipment maker is leveraging autonomous business technologies not to eliminate jobs, but to free up its workforce capacity for other types of tasks..For example, Deere & Co. is using large language models to help its supplier quality engineers read through stacks of warranty claims at faster rates. Typically, they can spend up to 15 hours a week combing through claims, Bishop said, but with AI tools looking for key words and phrases that time has shrunk to two hours..“What a way for us to then take the remaining 10-plus hours and say, ‘Here's some other problems we need to solve,’ or as we're experiencing attrition, just filling in that particular space and funding something else that leads to innovation,” Bishop said..On the factory floor, Deere is looking for other improvements by encouraging its workers to experiment with automated technology — within reason. Bishop said she is cultivating a “gamification” culture and a safe space to experiment, try and fail, but without it leading to engine failures and other manufacturing costs. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cranky-robot-shorter-weeks-manufacturers-120200448.html,Operational Risk

Which stock offers better value for investors?","Caterpillar Inc. CAT and Deere & Company DE are two of the world’s leading heavy equipment manufacturers. Caterpillar, widely recognized by its signature yellow machines, manufactures construction and mining equipment serving a variety of sectors like infrastructure, construction, mining, oil and gas, and transportation. Deere, known for its iconic green tractors, specializes in agricultural, forestry and turf equipment, with a strong presence in precision farming technology and construction equipment..Caterpillar (with a market capitalization of $140 billion) and Deere ($125 billion) are closely watched by investors to gauge the health of the broader manufacturing, infrastructure and agricultural landscape. With tariff tensions and contraction in the manufacturing sector weighing on industrials at large, the question is which stock you should put your money on..To find out, let us dive into the fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges of both Caterpillar and Deere..CAT's revenues have declined for the past four quarters, with earnings also falling in the last two quarters. This reflects persistent volume weakness in its two major segments, Resource Industries and Construction Industries, amid subdued customer spending. Resource Industries volumes have dropped for six quarters in a row, while Construction Industries has seen five consecutive declines, which negated the improved performance of the Energy and Transportation segment..Caterpillar has also been impacted by the downturn in China's real estate sector, particularly for 10-ton and larger excavators, which was once a key market for the company. Weak demand in Europe added to revenue pressures..The charts below show Caterpillar's revenue and earnings trends in the past four quarters.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. . . .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .For 2025, CAT expects a slight revenue dip from its 2024 reported number of $64.8 billion, led by lower Construction Industries and Resource Industries sales, which will negate expected strength in Energy and Transportation. However, Caterpillar projects its adjusted operating margin to be in the top half of its target range, corresponding to the anticipated level of revenues. The company maintains its broad revenue guidance at $42-$72 billion, with margins between 10% and 22%. Assuming 2025 revenues at $64.5 billion, its operating margin is likely to be 16-20%. While high labor costs and potential tariffs remain risks, Caterpillar’s pricing and cost-control initiatives should help cushion the impacts.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cat-vs-heavy-machinery-stock-155900128.html,Market Volatility Risk  Industry Risk  Competition Risk  Economic Risk  Regulatory Risk  Operational Risk

The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $5.72, reflecting a 32.94% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $10.71 billion, indicating a 21.33% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year..Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $19.15 per share and revenue of $37.98 billion. These totals would mark changes of -25.25% and -15.15%, respectively, from last year..Investors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Deere. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability..Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system..The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this agricultural equipment manufacturer have returned -3.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, to which Deere belongs, has lost 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Deere is expected to post earnings of $5.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%..The consensus earnings estimate of $19.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -24.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.77 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Deere is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Deere.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-company-attracting-investor-attention-130014957.html,Market Sentiment Risk

One overreaction led to another, but this morning, investors are already having second (or is it third?) thoughts about just how good even this good news can be, when things seem so uncertain in the stock market right now..As I type these words, for example, at 10:12 a.m. ET the S&P is down again -- 3.1%. Even blue chip industrial stocks are feeling kind of queasy, as GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) gyrates 2.8% lower, Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE) stumbles 3.1%, and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is particularly cranky with a 4.3% loss..Earlier in the week, you may recall, all three of these industrial stalwarts got dinged with downgrades by top Wall Street analysts. On Tuesday, Citigroup lowered its price targets on both Deere and Caterpillar on worries that rising tariffs will ""negatively impact U.S. farmers' exports and profits, likely extending the agriculture downcycle in North America,"" as The Fly reported at the time..Earnings season is just starting to ramp up, but as Citi fellow Wells Fargo pointed out, ""earnings may not matter as much as what happens with tariffs,"" and, for its part, Wells is planning to ""lean defensive"" on stock investing until the tariff situation settles down a bit. But didn't Trump remove the tariff threat yesterday? Well, yes and no. The president suspended imposition of massive reciprocal tariffs for many countries, but we don't precisely know which countries yet (although we think we know that China is not one of them). And that means that the tariff risk hasn't really gone away. It's more like it's just hiding in the bushes, ready to leap out without warning again at any time..Now, the good news is that not all stocks are created equal, and even among stocks that seem similar -- big industrial giants such as GE Aerospace, Deere, and Cat -- the risks may also be unequal. This morning, for example, Citi chimed back in to opine that ""defense companies have little exposure to tariffs,"" and that, in its opinion, this makes GE Aerospace (which sells airplane engines to the military as well as to commercial customers) somewhat of a safer play than other stocks in this sector.I'm not sure I agree with that, however.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ge-aerospace-deere-caterpillar-152546892.html,"Market Risk, Valuation Risk, Company Specific Risk"

Meanwhile, Home Depot and Lowe's Companies are major lawn care equipment retailers..As such, there isn't one magic number to watch out for, but rather a collection of data points that build a constantly evolving picture..The recent tumultuous trade tariff events are likely to negatively impact sales as consumers and commercial companies are likely to delay purchasing decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Indeed, back on March 6, Toro's management told investors, ""We recognize the heightened level of uncertainty affecting the macro environment, including a decline in consumer confidence and rapidly evolving trade policy."".That was before the wider-scale tariffs were announced on ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, so it's reasonable to expect a bigger impact now. Looking ahead, Toro will release its second-quarter earnings at some point in June, but before that, Deere will release its second-quarter earnings in mid-May.

Lowe's management didn't specifically call out the outdoor garden category in its fourth-quarter earnings but said various outdoor categories, like decking, had positive comparable sales growth..In both cases, investors should listen to what Home Depot and Lowe's say in May because they and Deere will be discussing the same environment that will guide Toro's sales trajectory in 2025..Before you buy stock in Toro, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Toro wasn’t one of them.

Over the past five years, Deere's total shareholder return, which includes both share price appreciation and dividends, was substantial, reaching about 220% up to today. This impressive growth underscores the company's resilience and operational effectiveness in the face of fluctuating market conditions..In comparison, the past year's performance reveals a different picture, with the broader market and industry facing declines, yet Deere managed to exceed the US market performance of a 5.8% decline and the US Machinery industry's 18.8% decline. This indicates that Deere has maintained a relative edge in a challenging economic landscape.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against other best farmland and agriculture stocks to buy now..At the beginning of March, the White House announced the imposition of 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and additional 10% tariffs on China. While President Trump granted a one-month tariff delay for automakers and paused the same for certain Mexican and Canadian goods until April 2, he announced in an interview with Fox News that tariffs “could go up” with time..Since tariffs on Chinese goods weren’t a part of the exemptions, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US, particularly targeting US agricultural goods. Specifically, a 10% tariff was imposed on American soybeans, while corn was hit with an additional 15% charge. CNBC reported that China is prepared to fight “any type of war” with the United States. The news channel reported that the Chinese Embassy in the US reported in a post on X:.“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.”.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson also labeled the American fentanyl-related explanation for imposing tariffs a “flimsy excuse.”.READ ALSO: 10 Best Consumer Staples Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 10 Best Mid Cap Biotech Stocks to Buy..On March 4, Landus Cooperative CEO, Matt Carstens, appeared on CNBC’s ‘The Exchange’ to talk about how tariffs could potentially slash the prices of various agricultural products and discuss the long-term benefits of these tariffs on agricultural markets. He said that a significant need to find markets exists for American farmers. Corn makes up about 20% of any given year that the US exports to other countries, while soybean reaches up to as much as 50% of America’s production going to other markets. This creates an interesting dynamic that puts considerable pressure on the ongoing circumstances..Carstens was of the view that the American farmers hopefully understand that the government is playing the long game here and working on something that would hopefully be significantly profitable for America in the long run. That translates to opportunities for farmers to get the most for commodities, something that they need to a great extent at the present.

An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy..Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 47.6% and 4.8% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Deere here>>>The ABR suggests buying Deere, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28).

The massive tractors, construction, and agricultural equipment they make requires a lot of steel and other raw materials that are subject to tariffs, and their high-priced finished goods sell best when customers are flush with cash..On Monday, UBS analyst Steven Fisher cut Caterpillar to a sell from neutral and lowered his price target to $243, from $385. Deere was kept at a neutral, but its price target was cut to $440 from $462..The downgrades are based on concerns that the macroeconomic impact of tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, will erode demand..Toro is more focused on consumer and industrial-grade lawn care, but could end up pinched by some of the same pressures that are likely to impact the makers of larger equipment. Deere could be especially vulnerable if ""reciprocal tariffs"" target agricultural exports, leaving farmers with less cash to invest in new equipment..In theory, onshoring could work out fine for these companies. If the tariffs are successful in bringing economic activity to the United States, new factories and facilities will be required, creating demand for heavy equipment. But that payoff is likely to be well into the future, and the downsides could hit almost immediately..These are three best-of-breed operators with a history of surviving in what are highly cyclical industries.

Caterpillar gets a significant portion of sales from China, one of the countries hardest hit by tariffs and one that is seen as likely to retaliate. Domestic business could be impacted as well, as the economic impact of tariffs ripples through the U.S. economy..Farmers, Deere's core customer group, tend to buy equipment during up cycles when they have extra cash at their disposal. About 20% of U.S. agricultural production is exported outside of the U.S., meaning tariffs could cut into farm profitability..Higher costs could also eat into demand for construction equipment if projects that were planned six months ago are now deemed cost prohibitive..There is also an argument to be made that tariffs can provide a boost to sales. All three of these companies face competition from foreign rivals. And should the tariffs have the desired effect and boost U.S. manufacturing, that will require a lot more factories and mean a lot of demand for heavy-duty equipment to build them..Truthfully, no one can say for sure how the tariffs will actually impact these businesses, or even know how long the tariffs will last..For long-term focused investors, there is ample history to suggest these businesses are all best-in-class operators who will eventually adjust to the new environment and thrive. But given the uncertainty about what is to come and how long the adjustment might take, there is every reason to be cautious right now..Before you buy stock in Deere & Company, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Deere & Company wasn’t one of them.

Deere is responding to a skilled labor shortage in the agriculture and construction industries by developing autonomous vehicle tech for its equipment.","Many top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have come into the spotlight and produced monster gains in recent years.

And many companies are using AI to their advantage in areas you might suspect..Deere (NYSE: DE) and GE Healthcare Technologies (NASDAQ: GEHC) are both highly profitable, while Samsara (NYSE: IOT) went public in December 2021. All three companies offer unique ways to invest in AI, and all three are worth buying now..Daniel Foelber (Deere): While you are probably familiar with Deere's agriculture and construction equipment, you may not be aware that Deere is also a play in industrial AI..Deere is responding to a skilled labor shortage in the agriculture and construction industries by developing autonomous vehicle tech for its equipment. It first unveiled its autonomous tractor in 2022. Earlier this year, Deere released its second-generation autonomous kit featuring computer vision, AI, and cameras. New solutions include an autonomous tractor for large-scale agriculture, an autonomous orchard tractor, an autonomous articulated dump truck for quarry operations, and an autonomous battery-electric mower for commercial landscaping. All of the machines are managed by the company's cloud-based platform, John Deere Operations Center Mobile..In addition to its AI opportunities, Deere could also be a solid stock to buy for investors who are concerned about how tariffs will impact U.S. companies. On its February earnings call, Deere noted that more than 75% of its domestic revenues come from equipment manufactured in the U.S., and less than 5% of U.S. completed goods sales come from Mexico. The majority of its products that are manufactured outside the U.S. are made in Europe. And Mexico only makes up 10% of U.S. manufacturing cost of goods sold, while China accounts for less than 2% and Canada is just 1%..So, despite its international presence, Deere is still predominantly a U.S. company from a manufacturing and sales perspective. That could help insulate it from the impact of trade conflicts, in contrast to companies with more global supply chains..Deere's stock price reached an all-time in February. However, its earnings, sales, and margins have dipped due to broader slowdowns across many of Deere's end markets. Deere is a cyclical company in a cyclical industry, so investors should be wary of putting too much weight on traditional valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio because the stock will look cheap when earnings are booming and expensive when earnings are coming down. However, P/E ratio can be a useful gauge when Deere is in mid-cycle form and when looking at historical averages.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-hidden-gem-ai-stocks-101500040.html,1.

The declines have worsened through the quarters, with the company witnessing a 48.8% plunge in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with equipment sales tanking 35.1%.The dismal performance was attributed to lower shipment volumes across all segments amid sluggish demand. Deere also noted a growing preference among buyers for used machinery rather than new equipment..Agricultural and Turf equipment sales moved down 34% in the quarter, with volumes falling 35%. Farmer spending has been muted amid low commodity prices. DE’s Construction and Forestry segment saw a year-over-year decline of 38% in sales in the quarter as volumes slumped 37%..The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts a 29.5% year-over-year increase in net farm income to $180.1 billion for 2025. This follows the 19% and 6% declines in net farm income witnessed in 2023 and 2024. However, the rebound will be mainly driven by the $33.1-billion year-over-year increase in direct government farm payments..Meanwhile, total crop receipts are forecast to decrease 2.3% from the 2024 level due to lower soybeans and corn prices. This could weigh on the demand for new farming equipment..DE anticipates net sales for Production and Precision Agriculture to decline 15-20% year over year in fiscal 2025. Sales of Small Agriculture and Turf are expected to drop 10%, reflecting market uncertainty, high interest rates and increased inventory levels, partially negated by the impacts of the U.S. government subsidies on farm incomes..Sales of Construction and Forestry are projected to move down 10-15%..Deere expects net income for fiscal 2025 between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, much lower than the $7.1 billion reported in fiscal 2024.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .Deere & Co. last week filed an answer to the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit alleging the tractor manufacturer holds a monopoly over its repair services, unfairly drives up costs and restricts farmers from fixing their equipment in a timely manner..Attorneys defended the John Deere maker in Illinois federal court, taking the original 37-page complaint apart piece by piece with answers for nearly every paragraph, repeatedly denying allegations that its “business practices are unlawful.” .Deere representatives also sought dismissal of the FTC’s lawsuit, which was filed in Jan. 15 with attorneys general from Illinois and Minnesota. Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin have since joined the suit..The issue over equipment repair practices has been building for years, with technological advancements that companies say are designed to make consumers’ lives easier actually creating headaches for those looking to fix their cars, tractors or smartphones..As more proprietary technologies and software become embedded in equipment, manufacturers are placing more restrictions on where repairs can be made. In the case of Deere, the company has made it so only authorized dealers have the service tools to fully repair the onboard central computers on its tractors..While Deere offers a different repair tool to customers and independent repair shops, the FTC claims that version is inferior to the one available to authorized dealers, saying the tool is allegedly incapable of doing all repairs on Deere equipment..This has not only limited where farmers can go to fix their equipment, but is anticompetitive for independent repair shops and makes consumers susceptible to unfairly inflated costs, according to the complaint..In Deere’s answer to the lawsuit, filed March 17, the company acknowledged the existence of both service tools, but denied that its business practices are “unlawful or that it has violated any law.”.Attorneys admitted that it developed a proprietary service tool for its tractors, but denied that other options were functionally inferior. .The company later admitted in the complaint response that its dealer tool has “particular uses and characteristics that differentiate it from other electronic repair tools,” including its customer tool, aptly named Customer Service Advisor.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-dissects-ftc-repair-lawsuit-121500937.html,1.

Yahoo Finance Head of News Myles Udland and Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods take a closer look at the stock, which can be viewed as a defensive play against tariff pressures..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here..Let's talk about John Deere. Uh, stock down about 1% today. This is a, of course, a global industrial ag play. A lot of characteristics that maybe are vulnerable to tariffs here, J, but I think a lot of characteristics that in the market we've discussed this hour is getting more defensive, a name that is meeting a lot of the criteria along those guidelines as well. .It's meeting fundamental criteria and technical criteria. I look back over the long term to get a picture. Where's this stock been? It had a nice two-year base on a weekly chart and it just broke out. So you have risk reward parameters set up where, okay, if it gets back below 80, maybe I get out of this trade, but the upside, it's not going to move like a tech stock. It's not going to go euphoric or to the moon as some of these, you know, names tend to do when they get momentum behind them. But but John Deere, I'm going to quote the CEO, John May. He said, and this is very important because this is where people's mindset is with this administration, 75% of all products that we sell in the United States are assembled here in the United States. So when you're talking about tariffs, you're talking about bringing jobs back, that has got a little patriotic overture. Uh that is something that this administration wants to see. Uh and uh so it's not your sexy name that you're going to want to, you know, go to the bar and talk to your friends, I just got into John Deere, but from a risk reward point of view, from something safe, John Deere right now is a good place to park your money. .And I guess it's interesting now the way that the process for investors kind of has to go in this point in time is to think about is there a, let's call it an America bid with any of these names, right? Is there a way that and we saw it with Apple coming out talking about how much they're going to invest in the US. You've seen it across industries. Companies are looking for ways right now to whether it's on a conference call, whether it's a one-off announcement, to remind the administration, remind its investor base, we not only have operations in the US, we want to build those operations in the US. It's a very interesting wrinkle inside thinking about, you know, okay, how much money they make and or how much money they bring in and how much do they keep. .Exactly. And when we're talking tariffs as well, if you're mostly based in the United States, then you're going to avoid some of these tariffs. So people will focus on that and they'll skate where the puck is and then focus on these American brands that are, you know, bringing products here and they don't have to worry about the uncertainty of tariffs that are about to hit them. .Yeah, maybe makes the negotiation on, hey, we should be exempt from this or that, the other, a little bit easier perhaps.

Deere & Company, Kubota and Lindsay are well-poised to capitalize on this demand, backed by their efforts to grow their products..Focusing on revolutionizing agriculture with technology to make farming automated, easy to use and more precise across the production process is expected to be another major catalyst. Deere, CNH Industrial and Kubota are, thus, investing heavily in upping their technology game..The Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry comprises companies that manufacture agricultural equipment. These equipment include tractors, combines, cotton pickers and harvesting equipment; tillage, seeding and application equipment, consisting of sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; and hay and forage equipment, comprising self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers..Some companies in the industry produce turf and utility equipment, consisting of riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, commercial mowing equipment, and garden tillers and snow throwers.

This projects an improved scenario, considering the 19% and 6% decline in net farm income in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, the increase in net farm income this year will be mainly due to the $33.1-billion year-over-year increase in direct government farm payments to $42.4 billion. Meanwhile total crop receipts are forecast to decrease 2.3% from the 2024 level due to lower soybeans and corn prices..Demand for Food to Fuel the Industry: Despite the ongoing volatility in commodity prices and lower crop receipts, agricultural equipment demand will continue to be supported by increased global demand for food, stemming from population growth and an increasing proportion of the population aspiring for better living standards.

The trend has picked up again this year following President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting DEI..Building on that momentum, conservative groups like the National Legal and Policy Center have recently issued shareholder proposals seeking to ensure that Deere remains “committed to its pledge to roll back DEI moving forward.”.The group’s proposal, which was voted down Feb. 26, would have required a report on “statistical differences in hiring across race and gender globally and/or by country.”.At Deere’s shareholder meeting, Luke Perlot, associate director of NLPC’s Corporate Integrity project, described concerns over corporate hiring practices, citing a Bloomberg report that only 6% of the 300,000 jobs added by S&P 100 companies in the year following the death of George Floyd went to White men.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-shareholders-vote-down-anti-112900974.html,"1.

But so far, none of these proposals have garnered support from investors at Apple (APPL), Costco (COST), and John Deere (DE)..And that's not expected to change as more votes are tabulated at more company shareholder meetings in the coming weeks and months, according to experts who follow these votes..""I don't expect this year that we will see many, if any, get majority support,"" said Elizabeth Bieber, head counsel for shareholder engagement and activism defense at Freshfields..""And I would expect that, when we look at the numbers, year over year, that we actually see waning support, regardless of which ideological side the proposal tends to fall on."".As of the end of February, a total of 21 ""anti-DEI"" proposals and 16 ""pro-DEI"" proposals were set for a vote this year among publicly traded companies included in the Russell 3000, according to the voting recommendation firm ISS-Corporate..ISS-Corporate expects the total number of DEI proposals to grow before the end of the voting season in April, although it's too early to know for sure. Last year, Russell 3000 company investors forced votes on 34 total proposals opposed to DEI initiatives and 77 in favor of them..This year’s early surge in anti-DEI measures could be a signal that opposition proposals are on the rise, Bieber said..It could also lead to a rise in dueling DEI proposals going to a vote within the same company, as happened in February at John Deere (DE). Deere shareholders voted down both pro-DEI and anti-DEI measures..""DEI, as of last year, is certainly one issue where companies were receiving [proposals] on both ends of the ideological spectrum,"" Bieber said.So far, neither pro- nor anti-oriented measures have gained much majority support.

An analyst downgraded the agricultural machinery stock, citing valuation concerns, even as President Donald Trump announced tariffs on ""external"" agricultural products effective April 2. China has already announced retaliatory tariffs in response..Analysts at R. W. Baird downgraded their rating on Deere stock from outperform to neutral while keeping the price target at $501 per share. That means only an 8% upside from the stock's Monday closing price..Baird's analyst is optimistic about Deere's inventory management and expects its earnings to grow in 2026, but still sees limited upside potential in the stock given its recent rebound. The firm also downgraded peer stocks amid a looming uncertainty in the agricultural sector, given the weak commodity prices, geopolitical concerns, and potential challenges from tariffs..Meanwhile, President Trump announced that the U.S. would impose tariffs on external agricultural products on April 2 to boost the domestic agriculture industry. With Trump already imposing sweeping tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, Beijing quickly retaliated and announced tariffs on several imported goods from the U.S. on March 3, including a wide basket of food and agricultural products. China was the largest importer of agricultural products from the U.S. in fiscal 2023, followed by Mexico and Canada, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture..Deere is the world's largest agricultural equipment company, and 34% of its total sales and revenue originated outside the U.S. and Canada in 2024. Although Deere tried to dispel fears during its latest earnings call by saying it's a ""net exporter"" of agricultural and turf equipment from the U.S., tariffs could further slow down the company's growth..Deere recently reported a 30% year-over-year drop in sales and a 50% drop in net income for the first quarter amid a challenging business environment. The agricultural giant reiterated its outlook of $5 billion to $5.5 billion for net income in 2025, but that would still be a drop of almost 22% over 2024 even at the highest end of its guidance range. With more tariffs and retaliatory moves in the air, it remains to be seen whether Deere will be able to meet its guidance this year..Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The software company he co-founded, best known for its Windows operating system, ranks among the most valuable companies globally, boasting a market capitalization of $3 trillion. This success has contributed to Gates becoming one of the wealthiest individuals, with his net worth recently estimated at $108 billion..In 2000, Bill and Melinda Gates established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now one of the world's largest charitable organizations. The foundation focuses on public health, poverty reduction, education, and climate change. Since 1994, the Gateses have contributed over $50 billion to its initiatives, including more than $1.94 billion in grants for vaccine research during the COVID-19 pandemic..According to a report by Business Insider, Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett have collectively contributed around $100 billion to the Gates Foundation to date. During an interview with the BBC, the Microsoft co-founder and Gates Foundation chair disclosed the extent of his philanthropic efforts. According to a foundation fact sheet, Gates and French Gates, who are now divorced, donated a total of $59.5 billion between the organization's inception in 2000 and the end of 2023. Meanwhile, Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has contributed an additional $39.3 billion..The foundation has been a major financial backer of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for malaria and tuberculosis vaccine research. It also played a pivotal role in launching Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which spearheads immunization efforts in low-income nations. Headquartered in Seattle, the foundation continues to expand its global impact. Following a $20 billion donation, Gates outlined plans to boost its annual spending by 50%, targeting $9 billion by 2026..Bill Gates has dedicated years and billions of dollars to addressing climate change. His foundation has directed substantial funding toward climate technology solutions while consistently highlighting major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from large energy and manufacturing companies that burn fossil fuels extensively.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Deere (NYSE:DE) so let's look a bit deeper..For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Deere, this is the formula:.Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities).0.12 = US$8.1b ÷ (US$103b - US$35b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2025)..So, Deere has an ROCE of 12%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 12%.. Check out our latest analysis for Deere .In the above chart we have measured Deere's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Deere  for free..We like the trends that we're seeing from Deere. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 12%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 39%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Deere thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital..In summary, it's great to see that Deere can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue..One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Deere and understanding it should be part of your investment process..While Deere isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets..Have feedback on this article?

Today, Des Moines Works employs about 1,500 people..Agricultural equipment makers have struggled to sell their machinery over the past year as weak farm incomes and high interest rates hamper borrowers from making big-ticket purchases..The sales slowdown has forced Deere, CNH Industrial and others to reduce their manufacturing workforces to better align with demand. Just in Iowa, the John Deere tractor maker has laid off 1,866 people across its factories and offices since March 2024, according to the state’s WARN log..“As we have repeatedly stated, these layoffs are due to the weakened farm economy and a reduction in customer orders for our equipment,” a spokesperson said in an email. Affected employees are eligible for severance packages depending on their years of service and can keep their healthcare benefits for up to six months..Last summer, Deere’s Des Moines Works factory expanded its sprayer assembly by 138,000 square feet as part of a $40 million investment in the building and infrastructure. As the company looks to grow and invest in the future, declining sales have been a recent pain point..First quarter sales totaled $6.8 billion, down 35% over last fiscal year.

These industries, often seen as immune to economic cycles, seemed to defy the typical patterns..He pointed out that in light of the current administration’s stance on food policy, especially with a health and human services secretary who has expressed disdain for processed foods and vaccinations, it was not just a cycle affecting these sectors anymore, it felt more like a targeted attack on the industries themselves. Cramer wondered, “What if RFK Jr. wakes up tomorrow and says, ‘I’m banning Fruit Loops’ or stopping weight loss shots?”.“I mean, everyone in this administration seems to think that the federal government could do whatever it wants.

However, I don't expect that to last too long. I do suspect that most of these tech stocks are going to start to reignite and and push higher. We started to see that with Microsoft just a couple days ago. Microsoft's been in a range almost for about a full year. And so it hasn't been the stocks like Microsoft which have led. It's really been the meta platforms, uh the push into software at a time when semiconductors have been lagging. So we've seen that move into Palenteer, of course. And yes, the last few days, we've seen a lot of stocks uh start to sell off sharply for reasons that maybe the fundamentals don't justify. And so technically, you know, many of those should be buying opportunities. But when you say what's been working, a lot of it's been the banks, not only here, but also in Europe. It's been the primary driving factor of of really why a lot of European indices have managed to outperform uh US stocks so far this year. It's been a falling euro and it's been really financials being in a very good spot for a lot of these banks that are outperforming. And so that's happened not only in Europe, but also here. Stocks like JP Morgan, uh Berkshire Hathaway and the like. So I I'm actually very encouraged by the financials. Uh industrials also have outperformed and people thought this sector would get hit hard on tariffs, but we've seen stocks like Deere and Caterpillar, some of these machinery names that have a lot of assets revenues coming from overseas. They've actually managed to thrive during this whole time. So I think there's a lot to be happy about and I think investors really need to ignore a lot of the exogenous events until they start to affect the stock market. And the stock market right now looks like it's it's operating uh, you know, with a lot of things .that are working that need to be working. That meaning technology coming back. The best performing sector in the last week almost. Uh, financials, industrials, discretionary, we're finally seeing the consumer return to the market after last year which it was absent. So uh, yeah, I'm optimistic at a time when sentiment is very guarded to say the least. .Um, I want to ask you specifically about Nvidia for a minute here, Mark, because we're going to be getting the earnings from the company next Wednesday after the close. We were crunching the numbers here today at Yahoo Finance and found that, you know, Nvidia counted alone for 20% of the S&P 500's gain last year. This year, it's only 5% thus far and it's and it's been underperforming the market. Is Nvidia still that big broad market catalyst that it was at one point? .I certainly think so that when you look at the market capitalization and how much Nvidia commands of the S&P and also QQQ. And so uh to your point, you know, it has lagged a bit in recent months. It's been more sideways. Still, stocks like Nvidia along with uh Taiwan Semi, Avago, those are some of the top stocks within the entire semiconductor space. But you know, you only have about three of the top 10 outperformers within the S&P that come from Magnificent 7. It's been pretty broad-based and spread amongst many different sectors. You have many of the financials, you have Walmart participating, showing great gains. So I I do think Nvidia is important. I I, you know, we heard from the conference calls of the Metas and the Amazons and the the Alphabet, how much they all referenced Nvidia in their conference calls saying that, yes, they're they're you're doing lots of capital spending and a lot of money is going into Nvidia. So there's continuing to be very high demand. I think that it's going to outpace supply. Uh, I don't think this this company and the stock is going away anytime soon. So I like Nvidia. I I I don't care to guess as to what earnings will be, but but honestly, the stock has had a very decent rebound in recent weeks at a time when many had given up on it, uh, based on deep seek, and now it's really started to show much better strength. And for me as a technician, that's encouraging. .Watch the video above to hear more about the strategist's expectations for Nvidia earnings..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-investors-ignore-exogenous-events-150043691.html,Market Volatility Risk   Equity Market Risk   Credit Risk   Liquidity Risk   Regulatory Risk   Event Risk: Exogenous Event
148,2025-02-18 20:15:00,Deere’s sales slump 35% as tariffs impacts loom,The company will continue to cut tractor and combine production to meet sluggish demand. Executives also said China’s trade levies will have an “immaterial impact” on the business.,"This story was originally published on Manufacturing Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Manufacturing Dive newsletter. .Deere & Co. reported muted sales in the first quarter as it looks to mitigate tariff impacts on its farm and construction equipment costs and supply chains..The tractor giant’s Q1 sales slumped 35% to $6.8 billion over last year, driven by sluggish global demand for agriculture and earthmoving equipment. Deere’s profits were slashed to $869 million for the period as efforts to cut production and reduce the company’s dealer inventories continued..Amid a downturn in the farm economy, Deere and its competitors are also navigating a dynamic trade backdrop complicated by tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. The tariffs with China will have an “immaterial” impact on the business, SVP and CFO Joshua Jepsen said in an earnings call Thursday..Over the years, Jepsen said Deere has focused on supplier resiliency and cost management to better respond to external disruptions that stem from the COVID-19 pandemic and global trade issues — “which position us well to navigate the current environment.”.The tractor giant has leveraged its scale to become a net exporter of agriculture and turf equipment from the United States. More than 75% of Deere’s domestic sales account for products assembled at U.S. manufacturing facilities, Jepsen said. A small percentage of equipment parts come from other countries. .“In terms of component sourcing, about 10% of our U.S. manufacturing cost of goods sold come from Mexico, with less than 2% coming from China and approximately 1% from Canada,” Jepsen said..In terms of exports, Jepsen said more than half of Deere’s products are sent to Canada, with the remainder going to Europe, Brazil and Australia..Deere, Agco and other tractor markers could face stronger headwinds following Trump’s recent tariff spree, which has opened up the U.S. to retaliatory measures from major trading partners and created market uncertainty. The European Commission on Thursday said it will “react firmly and immediately” against tax increases related to Trump’s proposed “reciprocal” trade policy..“The situation is certainly fluid and we continue to monitor changes in policy as they occur,” Jepsen said before reciprocal tariffs were proposed. “Teams across the organization are continually running potential scenarios to understand risks along with opportunities to mitigate these impacts.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-sales-slump-35-tariffs-121548249.html,1.

151,2025-02-14 17:00:00,Fortune 500 giants like Meta and Target are rolling back DEI—These are the policies they’re changing,"From ERGs to Pride parades, here’s what companies have cut from their diversity and inclusion programs.","Just a few years ago, major companies ostentatiously adopted diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in response to the murder of George Floyd and the nationwide racial reckoning that followed. Now, some of those same companies are now backtracking on their DEI efforts—or doing away with their programs entirely..The shift began with the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in 2023 that overturned affirmative action in the college admissions process. That was followed by an increasing cultural backlash in conservative circles against DEI policies, a phenomenon that can trace its origins from legal activist like Edward Blum to modern figureheads like Robby Starbuck..Several companies changed or shut down their DEI programs in 2024, including Boeing and Ford. But anti-DEI sentiment reached a whole new level with the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January. This year, his executive orders have ended DEI programs in the federal government, and are crafted in a way to prompt private sector companies to destroy their programs and policies. Federal contractors have also been targeted..While some companies have made public statements regarding their DEI policies, others are quietly making changes behind the scenes. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to getting rid of DEI, but the backpedalling within corporate America is impossible to ignore..These are the major companies that have recently made changes to their DEI programs. .Tractor Supply announced in June of 2024 that it was cutting its DEI programs after facing backlash from a group of conservative activists led by Robby Starbuck. The retailer said in its statement that in addition to eliminating DEI roles and goals, it would no longer support or sponsor “nonbusiness activities like Pride festivals and voting campaigns.” The company also announced that it would be withdrawing their carbon emission goals..Tractor Supply did not reply to Fortune’s request for comment. .In July of 2024, farm equipment manufacturer John Deere announced that it would no longer be participating in or supporting “cultural awareness parades, festivals, or events,” such as Pride. They also promised to remove “socially motivated messages” from all-company mandated training materials..Deere and Co. did not reply to Fortune’s request for comment. .Ford Motors announced that it was in the process of amending its DEI policies in August of 2024, although the company said some of the changes had already begun prior. These include ceasing participation in external diversity surveys and evolving their employee resource groups (ERGs) to focus on “networking, mentorship, personal and professional development, and community service,” according to an internal memo sent to employees by CEO Jim Farley and reviewed by Fortune. A Ford Motor Company spokesperson told Fortune that the ERG transition began in 2023, while the company’s decision to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index was made in early 2024.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fortune-500-giants-meta-target-090000985.html,1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses..In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed China’s retaliatory actions against President Trump’s tariffs. The program was aired on the day China retaliated, and Cramer commented on Chinese actions against coal gas and others and export control on critical minerals. Starting from coal, he shared “Coal, very much in demand in Western Europe. Liquefied natural gas, demand everywhere. Minerals, okay they’ve already had pretty tight controls.”.Since the natural resources targeted by China were already in demand in other regions, he outlined: “So I look at this and I say, alright, what they’re saying is. We don’t wanna go to war. So what we’re gonna do is demonstrate that we’re going after some things. That we know they are not important to you. We know it doesn’t hurt any aspect but we can’t lose face here. We gotta do something.”.Cramer believes that the restrictions against “Liquefied natural gas [are] the funniest one. Because the demand for liquefied natural gas is insane.” As a result, he believes that the Chinese reaction was “a statement which basically says Mr. President, we heard you, maybe we ought to sit down and talk. Now there are some people would say appeasers, I don’t want to use that strong term. There are people within the government who very much want a deal. I think the President very much wants a deal. They can raise the ten to twenty five.”.The CNBC host also believes that the Chinese actions suggested that they were trying to find common ground with the President. He believes “what they’re saying, I think is, you know what. Common ground here. We’re gonna hit you on some things that aren’t gonna hurt you. Let’s talk. And that’s what this is.” On the other hand, the actions against Canada were “very central to their country,” he outlined..“China is basically saying, look, come on, let’s do some talking,” Cramer added. He believes that it would be important to hear next “is China going to do anything that lessens its friendship with Russia?” When asked why China would do that, Cramer replied “Well because I think that the President perceives . . . .the Russians [are] losers now. And the President does not like losers. I think he’d like to separate China.”.He also shared details about a potential difference in opinion in the White House over the Trump administration’s approach against China.

Investors were disappointed, sending Deere shares down more than 5% at the open on Thursday and down 3% as of 11:45 a.m. ET.  Deere is one of the world's largest manufacturers of agriculture and outdoor equipment.","Agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE) fell short of expectations in the most recent quarter and issued a subdued forecast for the quarter ahead..Investors were disappointed, sending Deere shares down more than 5% at the open on Thursday and down 3% as of 11:45 a.m. ET..Deere is one of the world's largest manufacturers of agriculture and outdoor equipment. Its machines are second to none, but this is a business tied to a notoriously cyclical industry..The company earned $3.19 per share in its fiscal first quarter, ending Jan. 26, on revenue of $8.51 billion, missing the consensus earnings estimate by $0.06 per share but beating on revenue by $620 million. That sales number was down 30% year over year, a reflection of tepid demand among farmers..CEO John C. May said: ""Deere's performance in the first quarter highlights our continued focus on optimizing inventory levels of both new and used equipment amid the uncertain market conditions our customers are facing. We're seeing compelling evidence that our efforts are positioning the company to successfully navigate the current environment."".The company is a best-in-class manufacturer, but it is hard to see things improving overnight. Management forecast full-year precision agriculture sales to be down another 15% to 20% in fiscal 2025, forestry sales down 10% to 15%, and small equipment and turf sales down by 10%..Deere's heavy equipment is expensive, and farmers tend to buy primarily when crop prices are high and they feel good that conditions will remain favorable. With all the talk of tariffs and uncertain global demand, it is a difficult market to be selling into. For long-term holders, Deere can be a winner.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against other best industrial stocks to invest in now..Industrial stocks were on a roll in 2024 as the overall sector ended the year up 26% on navigating deteriorating economic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and heightened inflation. At the same time, a slowing Chinese economy was expected to hurt sentiments in the sector, but that was not the case..Fast forward, the outlook in the industrial sector remains optimistic despite growing concerns about trade tariffs that could affect deals and operations. US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a new 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports..Trump’s trade policy overhaul would involve a significant increase in tariffs on top of the current metals duties. According to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute and the government, South Korea, Vietnam, Brazil, and Canada are the top three countries from which the United States imports steel. As a result, the tariffs have the potential to shake the nation’s industrial sector..READ ALSO: 12 Best Multibagger Penny Stocks to Buy Now and Michael Burry Stock Portfolio: Top 8 Stock Picks..“Canadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defense, shipbuilding and auto. We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries,” Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X..Nevertheless, there is growing optimism that a return of manufacturing to the US from other countries amid the trade tariffs would be a boon for the sector. Activities in the industrial sector are expected to improve significantly amid the growing push to reinvest in domestic infrastructure..The need to bring supply chains onshore to avert the ever-growing geopolitical risk is another factor that should bolster sentiments in the industrial sector. Additionally, heightened investments in electrification and the development of artificial intelligence should also have a positive impact. The fact that only a quarter of the $1.9 trillion worth of projects announced since 2020 have entered into the construction phase underscores the tremendous opportunities around industrial stocks..The expected surge in spending on domestic manufacturing under the new administration should greatly benefit equipment rental specialists’ electrical equipment companies, among others. The commercial aerospace sector is another segment expected to be on a roll after years of slowdown following the COVID-19 pandemic. A shortage of new planes as travel recovers is presenting tremendous opportunities for companies in the aerospace segment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-company-best-industrial-stock-034843750.html,Market Risk Equity Risk Economic Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against other important news updates investors shouldn’t miss..Investor optimism is still strong despite ongoing economic uncertainties, with analysts highlighting some important factors that are driving market performance. Earnings growth, technological advancements, and investment trends continue to shape the outlook, while interest rates and inflation are still important considerations. Experts are assessing how these elements will influence long-term market trends and whether the current bull run can be sustained in the coming years..At CNBC’s Squawk Box, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth showed bullish sentiment toward the market, especially due to strong earnings growth. She compared the current environment to past periods of innovation, such as the 1920s and 1990s, emphasizing the role of AI, robotics, and Web3 in driving long-term growth. Unlike the 1990s, she noted that companies today are funding investments with cash and equity rather than excessive leverage. She believes that the S&P could reach 7,200 to 7,400 this year and 10,000 to 13,000 by the end of the decade, as she expects the bull market to extend through 2029 to 2030..Despite concerns about past market crashes, Bartels believes the current rally is more sustainable due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines and relatively low market leverage. While she acknowledged the possibility of another bear market, she expects a recovery leading to new highs..Moreover, Bartels sees the 10-year Treasury yield fluctuating between 4% and 5% in 2024, with near-term expectations of 4.2% before potentially rising again if economic growth remains strong. She also warned that inflation data, including PPI and CPI, could impact yields, and require close monitoring..For this article, we selected stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Deere currently carries a Zacks Rank #3..Deere has been facing challenges due to weak farmer spending amid low commodity prices. In the wake of challenging conditions in the global agricultural and construction sectors, DE has been aligning its production with demand levels. This is likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter performance. High production expenses; selling , administrative and general expenses; and research and development expenses are likely to have impacted the company’s margin in the quarter. Nevertheless, favorable price realization is expected to have negated some of these headwinds, as seen in the fiscal fourth quarter..Our model predicts the Production & Precision Agriculture segment’s revenues to be $3.59 billion for the fiscal first quarter, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 26%. We expect the segment’s operating profit to be $422 million, indicating a 59.6% fall from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

We predict the segment’s operating profit to plunge 56.5% year over year to $596 million.Our estimate for the Financial Services segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.59 billion for the fiscal first quarter, indicating an 11.1% rise from the year-ago quarter’s actual.

IR is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 13, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ingersoll Rand’s fourth-quarter earnings has remained steady in the past 60 days. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the consensus estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average surprise being 9.1%.The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.9 billion, indicating growth of 4.9% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings is pinned at 84 cents per share, indicating 2.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s number.Let’s see how things have shaped up for IR this earnings season.Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar..IR’s Industrial Technologies & Services segment’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from higher orders across its product portfolio of industrial vacuums and blowers along with stable orders for compressors. We anticipate the segment’s revenues to increase 3.6% year over year to $1.56 billion.The Precision and Science Technologies segment is anticipated to have performed well, backed by growth in short-cycle orders and strong book-and-ship orders. We expect the segment’s revenues to increase 10.5% year over year to $345.3 million.Ingersoll Rand has been making continued investments to support growth in demand generation and the Industrial Internet of Things, which are expected to have driven its performance.Synergistic gains from the acquisitions made by the company are expected to have boosted revenues. In June 2024, Ingersoll Rand acquired ILC Dover, integrating it into its Precision & Science Technologies segment. This acquisition enhanced the company’s capabilities, with ILC Dover’s single-use solutions for biopharma and pharma production complementing its expertise in liquid handling technologies and positive displacement pumps.In the same month, IR acquired Complete Air and Power Solutions (“CAPS”), Del PD Pumps & Gear Pvt Ltd. (Del Pumps) and Fruvac Ltd. (Fruitland Manufacturing). The acquisition of Del Pumps complemented IR’s expertise in mission-critical, pumping solutions across life science, food and beverage and medical industries. The buyout augmented the precision technologies business within the Precision and Science Technologies segment.The CAPS buyout expanded IR’s product portfolio for its clients and the acquisition of Fruitland augmented its capabilities in the mobile vacuum market. Ingersoll Rand integrated both companies into its Industrial Technologies and Services segment.In the fourth quarter, we expect the company’s total revenues to be $1.91 billion, indicating an increase of 4.8% year over year.However, increasing costs of sales are likely to have weighed on IR’s performance. Rising selling and administrative expenses are likely to have dented the company’s margins and profitability.Given the company’s substantial international presence, foreign-currency headwinds are expected to have affected its top line.Ingersol Rand’s adjusted earnings are expected to be 83 cents per share, indicating a 3% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s number.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ir-gears-post-q4-earnings-160900715.html,1.

Get prepared with the key expectations.,"Deere (DE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price..The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise..This agricultural equipment manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -49.6%..Revenues are expected to be $7.7 billion, down 26.6% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-150054007.html,Market Risk Earnings Risk Company Specific Risk

184,2025-02-04 01:10:00,Why Deere (DE) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Deere (DE) has an impressive earnings surprise history and currently possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely beat in its next quarterly report.,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Deere (DE). This company, which is in the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, shows potential for another earnings beat..This agricultural equipment manufacturer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 12.71%..For the last reported quarter, Deere came out with earnings of $4.55 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 per share, representing a surprise of 16.97%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.80 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.29 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.45%..For Deere, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank..Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Deere currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.12%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner..Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric..Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-deere-could-beat-earnings-171014836.html,Equity Market Risk Earnings Risk Market Sentiment Risk

Shareholder Amalgamated Bank raised such concerns through advocacy group As You Sow, which Deere & Co. sought to dismiss with a “no-action request.”.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ruled against the no-action request. .Originally, Deere shot down the proposal, stating that conservative think tank National Legal and Policy Center had issued a similar request to outline DEI programming and policies.

Deere had sued Agco, arguing the technology infringed on its 633 and 955 patents used for its ExactEmerge precision technology, as well as other patents not mentioned in the appeal..Deere claimed that Agco’s systems used methods for capturing and delivering seeds that are protected under its patents. However, Agco argued that its products operated differently by projecting and accelerating the seeds rather than capturing them..In 2022, the case went to trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where a jury found that Agco did not infringe Deere’s patents..The federal appellate court affirmed the lower court’s ruling late last week..“This ruling validates our commitment to innovation and the integrity of our products,” Agco said in a statement Jan. 24. “We remain dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions to our customers and will continue to focus on advancing our technology.”.Precision Planting is one of Agco’s major brands and became part of a joint venture with Trimble’s precision agriculture business last year called PTx Trimble.

According to the FTC, this has boosted Deere’s multi-billion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts, growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs..Most Read on Manufacturing.net:.WATCH: 55-Year-Old Arkansas Plant Closing Permanently.WATCH: Impact Plastics Suffers Backlash for Sending Gift Cards with Final Paychecks After Deadly Hurricane.Manufacturing Error Leaves Dunkin' Stores Without Any Doughnuts.Molson Coors Rejects Leinenkugel Family's Attempt to Save Brewery.“Illegal repair restrictions can be devastating for farmers, who rely on affordable and timely repairs to harvest their crops and earn their income,” FTC Chair Lina M.

However, with the increasing computerization of Deere’s equipment over the past few decades, farmers must now rely on Deere’s interactive software tool called Service ADVISOR, which Deere makes available only to its authorized dealers, the FTC’s complaint states..An alternative repair tool exists, Customer Service ADVISOR, but it is reportedly incapable of doing all repairs on Deere agriculture equipment. Deere also allegedly fails to make the information necessary to develop a fully functional repair tool available to generic repair tool developers..The lawsuit seeks to require Deere to grant large tractors and combines owners, as well as independent repair providers, access to its Service ADVISOR repair tool and any other repair resources offered to authorized dealers..In a response, Deere stated that the FTC and state attorneys general based the lawsuit on ""flagrant misrepresentations of the facts and fatally flawed legal theories.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-sues-john-deere-unfair-153335454.html,1.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Agriculture Dive newsletter. .The Federal Trade Commission and two states have sued Deere & Co., alleging the tractor giant has a monopoly over its repair services, which raises costs and creates delays for farmers..According to a 37-page complaint filed Wednesday along with the states of Illinois and Michigan, the company made software to diagnose and repair equipment's electronic functions that was, for decades, only available to authorized dealers and essentially handcuffed where farmers could go for critical repairs..The FTC said its lawsuit seeks to stop the tractor giant’s alleged anticompetitive practices and make the software tool more widely available. Deere bristled at the complaint and said it will vigorously defend itself from these “meritless” claims..As tractors and combines become more technologically advanced, farmers have complained that manufacturers are limiting access to critical parts, tools or documents needed to fix the equipment themselves. Independent repair shops are also often shut out of accessing these tools, leaving farmers with fewer and often more expensive options..In Deere’s case, the company’s interactive software tool, called Service Advisor, is only available to authorized dealers, according to the FTC’s complaint. That restricts farmers’ ability to quickly seek repairs necessary for planting and harvesting..While another repair tool called Customer Service Advisor exists, it is incapable of doing all repairs on Deere agriculture equipment..Because of these limitations, the FTC said Deere has “unlawfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in the market,” forcing farmers to spend more money on repairs that require the Service Advisor tool. The company’s restrictions also allow Deere to reap additional profits through parts sales because dealers “almost always” use expensive Deere-branded parts instead of generic parts..“The FTC’s action today seeks to ensure that farmers across America are free to repair their own equipment or use repair shops of their choice — lowering costs, preventing ruinous delays, and promoting fair competition for independent repair shops,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement Wednesday..In 2023, the American Farm Bureau Federation signed a voluntary memorandum of understanding with a number of agricultural equipment manufacturers, including Deere, to strengthen farmers’ rights to repair in exchange for dropping calls for tighter regulation. However, critics say the agreement fell short of real repair protections, and a group of farmers have moved forward with a lawsuit against the tractor giant.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-sued-ftc-over-farmers-115134766.html,1.
