3,2025-06-26 21:04:00,Chevron Restarts Operations at Leviathan Gas Field After Ceasefire,"CVX has resumed gas operations at Leviathan, restoring critical exports to Egypt and Jordan, and stabilizing regional supply.","Chevron Corporation CVX has resumed operations at the Leviathan natural gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast following a temporary suspension triggered by the Iran-Israel conflict. The restart comes after a ceasefire agreement and a security reassessment by Israeli authorities. As the operator of Leviathan, Chevron prioritized safety while preparing for a quick recovery once the situation stabilized. This move underscores Chevron’s ability to navigate complex geopolitical environments without compromising long-term energy commitments to Israel, Egypt and Jordan..In response to an emergency directive issued by Israel’s Energy Ministry, due to growing national security concerns following escalating tensions with Iran, Chevron shut down its operations at the giant Leviathan natural gas field on June 13..With a stall in Leviathan field operations, a significant share of Israel’s export capacity got stuck, disrupting the vital energy corridor linking the Mediterranean with North Africa and Europe. The move also cut a key gas supply route to Egypt just as summer demand surged..The temporary halt at Leviathan, which was active since June 13, led to an estimated $12 million in revenue loss. Chevron and its partners acted swiftly to mitigate the impact, aligning closely with government directives. The resumption of Leviathan ensures the continuity of gas exports that supply nearly 15-20% of Egypt’s energy demand. With operations now restored, Egypt is preparing to restart gas supplies to industrial sectors, a testament to the critical role Chevron plays in regional energy stability..Leviathan ranks among the largest deepwater natural gas fields globally. It is the most stable and robust energy hub in the Mediterranean. Located in the Levant Basin, the field has seen approximately 85 trillion cubic feet of hydrocarbon discoveries over the past two decades. Thanks to its vast resource base, Leviathan’s natural gas reserves have grown around 40% in the past 10 years. The project, jointly developed by NewMed Energy (45.34%), Chevron Mediterranean (39.66%) and Ratio Energies (15%), is one of the region’s largest gas ventures, supplying natural gas to Israel, Egypt and Jordan..Currently producing 12 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas annually, Leviathan is set to expand output to 14 bcm by 2026, reinforcing its role as a major regional supplier.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-restarts-operations-leviathan-gas-120400606.html,no risk

An increase in defense spending could bolster its growth prospects.  The stock has become a speculative investment, which can make it a volatile holding.","Palantir's valuation has been riding high due to both strong results and solid support from retail investors..An increase in defense spending could bolster its growth prospects..The stock has become a speculative investment, which can make it a volatile holding..10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›.Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) soared 85% this year as of June 23. The data analytics company expects to grow its top line by more than 36% in 2025 as its robust artificial intelligence (AI) platform has been experiencing a surge in demand. Palantir also benefited from being a popular stock among retail investors, which enabled its valuation to continue rising higher..Entering trading on Tuesday, its market cap was $330 billion, with its valuation now being higher than Coca-Cola, UnitedHealth Group, Chevron, and many other blue-chip companies. The big questions, however, are can it still go higher, and can it top a $1 trillion valuation within the next couple of years?.Palantir's share price got disconnected from its fundamentals a long time ago. Looking at earnings or revenue multiples isn't helpful in assessing the stock simply because there's no way to rationalize the stock's value in such a way. It generated more than $3.1 billion in sales over the past four quarters, and right now, it's trading at around 110 times its sales. .To help put this into perspective, consider the following scenario: If top AI stock Nvidia were to trade at such a multiple, its market cap would be north of $16 trillion, and it would be more than four times as valuable as the next largest stock..Because of this, Palantir is more of a speculative stock than a blue-chip investment. Its valuation is closely tied to future growth expectations. One reason why those expectations may rise is the push from U.S. President Donald Trump for allies to ramp up defense spending. Palantir is a trusted provider of counterterrorism software for government agencies around the world. If countries spend more on defense, Palantir may inevitably benefit. Many of America's allies in NATO appear to be willing to invest as much as 5% of their GDP on defense. The U.S., which spends the most, spent around 3.2% of its GDP on defense last year, according to data from NATO. .If Palantir's growth rate accelerates due to an influx of government spending, it's conceivable that this already scorching-hot stock could rally and go into yet another gear. Over a two-year window, Palantir's stock would need to rise by another 200% to get close to a $1 trillion market cap.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-technologies-stock-reach-1-094500874.html,Market Risk

If so, that's certainly understandable. These aren't exactly the most encouraging of times, after all..Just don't let short-term headlines prevent you from staying focused on the long-term picture. The global economy is actually rather resilient, capable of eventually overcoming any hurdle put in front of it. The market reliably follows that. The only adjustment you might want to make here is owning a few more income-producing investments, and a little less growth..If you've got $3,000 -- or any other amount -- you're looking to deploy, here's a rundown of three dividend stocks that would work well in almost every income-minded investor's portfolio..There's no denying that mega-retailer Walmart has trounced smaller rival Target (NYSE: TGT) over the past few years. Target's more discretionary selection of merchandise just hasn't resonated with inflation-weary consumers, who've been more interested in the value-priced consumer staples that only Walmart can offer..As the old cliché goes though, nothing lasts forever. Given enough time, things change..And Target's change may be coming..This doesn't seem to be the case with just a quick glance at the company's recent results. Target's first-quarter sales slipped nearly 3%, while its same-store sales fell 3.8% year over year. That's a reversal of the modest progress seen as of the end of last year..Analysts still expect shallow rekindled growth beginning later this year into next year though, perhaps boosted by the newly created office of enterprise acceleration meant to make the company more agile and nimble. The company also recently hired a new chief digital officer and a chief stores officer who is responsible for customers' complete in-store experience. While there's no guarantee these hires will actually drive the growth they're expected to spur, they do suggest Target finally recognizes it needs to do more, and/or do something else..None of these developments will directly impact Target stock's dividend anytime soon either, to be clear -- not that it was a worry. Even with the company's recent challenges its dividend was never in any real jeopardy. Indeed, it's now been raised for 54 consecutive years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartest-dividend-stocks-buy-3-072000206.html,Investment Strategy Risk

12,2025-06-26 03:12:00,Shell denies reports of BP megamerger of Big Oil rivals,A Shell-BP deal would represent the biggest energy deal of the century—if not ever.,"Shell said “no talks are taking place” for a potential megamerger with rival BP that would cost more than $80 billion and represent the biggest energy deal of the century..The denial comes on the heels of the Wall Street Journal reporting June 25 that Shell is in early talks to acquire BP in a much-rumored deal. BP has struggled financially in recent years—dealing with investor activism from Elliott Investment Management and others and launching a “hard reset” in early 2025 that cuts costs, shifts away from renewables, and doubles down on fossil fuels..Shell and BP (ranked No. 13 and No. 25 on the Fortune Global 500, respectively) have the most natural crossover with their London headquarters and global footprint, and a combination, although expensive, could position Shell to better compete with U.S. giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron..With its stock down 17% in the past 12 months—and 25% in a decade—BP’s $82 billion market cap not only trails Exxon ($470 billion), Chevron ($250 billion), and Shell ($211 billion), but also France’s TotalEnergies ($140 billion) and Houston-based ConocoPhillips ($113 billion), bringing BP’s long-term viability into question..“This is further market speculation. No talks are taking place,” a Shell spokesperson said June 25. “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline, and simplification.”.In May, when asked about BP, Shell CEO Wael Sawan said the bar is set very high for any acquisitions, and that he was focused on using capital to boost share buybacks. Shell is undergoing its own more modest revamp reemphasizing oil and gas..BP declined comment on June 25, but its CEO, Murray Auchincloss, addressed a potential Shell deal in a recent sit-down interview with Fortune..“I can’t really say anything other than we’re focused on our own business, our strategy, and driving it forward.

The article claimed the FTSE 100 giant was open to the prospect of merging with Shell..It follows months of rumours that BP had become a target for rivals after losing ground, in large part because of its ill-fated pivot to net zero..BP’s defences have also been weakened by the impending exit of chairman Helge Lund, who is leaving next year under pressure from shareholders. Elliott, the hedge fund, is a major investor in BP and has been pushing the group to improve its performance..The United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company Adnoc reportedly examined a takeover of BP last year and has more recently been assessing a bid for assets, opening the door to a possible break-up of BP. Previous reports have also claimed that Shell was examining a potential takeover..An investor who owns shares in both BP and Shell said they would back a merger because it would create cost reductions for both groups..However, they said Shell would have to pay a premium of at least 30pc – implying a takeover price of about 480p per share, or £75bn – to win shareholder support..BP, led by chief executive Murray Auchincloss, is currently valued at £58bn. Shell is the larger of the two with a market cap of £152bn..“I don’t think this has come as a surprise. The genie is out of the bottle now on BP,” the investor said. “BP is an attractive asset for Shell because there’s a lot of synergies..“The market didn’t expect Shell to do it now because they still have cost-cutting plans, but they’re getting to the end of those. BP has been weak and with a low market cap, so there’s quite a lot of synergies.”.They added that another possible suitor for BP, American giant Chevron, was effectively ruled out of bidding for now because of litigation in the US about its takeover of Hess..This would make any Shell bid for BP easier because a major competitor could not launch a counter-offer for several months..Any deal would be hugely sensitive given BP is seen as a strategically important asset for the British state. It was majority-owned by the government until the 1980s and still enjoys close links.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-talks-acquire-bp-160549067.html,"Market Risk, Regulatory Risk, Operational Risk, Credit Risk"

On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR.” This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will! God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!”.Israel later accused Iran of what it described as a “severe violation” of President Donald Trump’s ceasefire,  a charge Iran denies, NBC News reports. Trump acknowledged that both Iran and Israel violated the ceasefire, telling a group of reporters that he is going to see if he can stop the ceasefire violations. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f— they’re doing,” he said..FED RATE SHOULD BE LOWER: On Monday night, President Donald Trump posted to Truth Social: “Too Late” Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate. Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy – We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus.

Here’s a quick rundown of how events unfolded..June 11: The U.S. announced the partial evacuation of embassies in the Middle East, sparking fears of regional escalation. Oil prices spiked on concerns about supply disruption..June 12: Israel launched airstrikes against Iranian military and infrastructure sites, escalating tensions significantly. Crude oil rose sharply as traders priced in the possibility of broader conflict..June 22 (overnight): The U.S. bombed suspected Iranian nuclear sites, pushing crude to its highest price point since early spring..June 23 (morning): As markets opened, Iran’s measured response, avoiding extreme retaliation or Strait of Hormuz disruption, caused oil prices to plunge rapidly, as traders breathed a sigh of relief that the worst-case scenario appeared unlikely..June 24: USO still traded at about $72.50 per share, around 1% higher than its price June 10, before the Israel-Iran escalation..The USO ETF captured this swing vividly: from a sharp rally to nearly a full reversal, highlighting the risk of trading based on geopolitical headlines alone..The broader energy sector fund, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLE), also saw wild swings, although not as pronounced as ETFs that track crude oil prices..Commodities like oil, along with precious metals like gold, often serve as diversification tools for portfolios, particularly during times of inflation or geopolitical uncertainty.

Inc. (Chevron) for additional LNG supply from its Lake Charles LNG export facility. The 20-year agreement for 1.0 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) increases Chevron’s total contracted volume from Energy Transfer LNG to 3.0 mtpa, following the initial 2.0 mtpa agreement signed in December 2024..As with the first SPA, the LNG will be supplied to Chevron on a free-on-board (FOB) basis and the purchase price will consist of a fixed liquefaction charge and a gas supply component indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark. The obligations of Energy Transfer LNG under the SPA remain subject to Energy Transfer LNG taking a positive final investment decision (FID) as well as the satisfaction of other conditions precedent..""This agreement marks a significant milestone in our growing partnership with Chevron and underscores the increasing global demand for reliable, long-term LNG supply,"" said Tom Mason, President of Energy Transfer LNG. ""With Energy Transfer’s strategic infrastructure and connectivity to key production basins, Lake Charles LNG is poised to be a premier export facility, providing long-term value to our partners and the industry."".""This expanded LNG agreement reflects the growing strength of Chevron’s global gas business,"" said Freeman Shaheen, President, Chevron Global Gas.

The energy giant just acquired 125,000 acres across Texas and Arkansas in the Smackover Formation, marking its first official step into commercial lithium production. This essential material is crucial for manufacturing electric vehicle (EV) batteries.The company plans to use the Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology. This method promises to be quicker and more efficient than traditional mining, all while having a smaller impact on the environment. The Smackover Formation, known for its oil history, is now recognized as one of North America's richest lithium sources.Chevron's decision reflects a broader strategy to diversify beyond oil and gas. The company is leveraging its extensive experience in drilling, managing reservoirs, and handling fluids for this new venture. This shift comes at a time when there's increasing demand for domestically produced battery materials, as the United States aims to secure its critical mineral supply chains amid global uncertainties.Chevron's move into lithium isn't just a small side project; it shows a dedication to building a lasting, scalable business in energy transition materials. By utilizing its deep operational knowledge, Chevron is set to become a key player in the U.S. lithium supply chain. This step highlights not only a diversification of its portfolio but also Chevron's commitment to powering the electrification age and strengthening U.S. energy independence..Chevron’s larger rival, ExxonMobil XOM, is already a step ahead in the lithium race. Back in 2023, the company secured 120,000 acres in the Smackover Formation, showing its early commitment to this critical mineral. ExxonMobil plans to leverage its deep expertise in underground operations and DLE technology, with an ambitious goal to produce enough lithium to power over one million EVs every year by 2030. The company has already signed supply agreements, including a major deal with South Korean battery manufacturer LG Chem. ExxonMobil is building a commercial facility in Arkansas, targeting first production by 2027.Occidental Petroleum OXY, through its TerraLithium subsidiary, is also making an ambitious play in the lithium market. The company holds significant land in Arkansas and has partnered with Berkshire Hathaway in California's Salton Sea region. Occidental Petroleum’s focus is on extracting lithium from geothermal brines using proprietary DLE methods. This approach isn't just about churning out lithium but also aims for a low-carbon production method. This lithium venture naturally fits with Occidental Petroleum's larger goals of carbon management and decarbonization.

25,2025-06-25 05:00:00,Lula’s Brazil Doubles Down on Oil and Cash,"Brazil’s Lula government is pursuing new oil auctions and refinery expansions despite ambitious net-zero targets, aiming for energy security and increased oil revenue.","A new offshore oil auction in the Amazon, a major investment in refinery expansion, and an attempt to extract $6.2 billion from the energy industry—this may not sound very appropriate for a government that has made some big net-zero promises. Yet it is exactly what the Lula da Silva government in Brazil is doing..South America’s biggest country produces around 3.5 million barrels of crude daily. It also recently auctioned 19 blocks in the Foz do Amazonas basin, part of the Equatorial Basin and a highly sensitive ecosystem, according to environmentalists. Their opposition, however, did not stop the auction, which featured successful bidders such as Exxon, Chevron, and China’s CNPC, in addition to Brazil’s own state energy major, Petrobras..The Equatorial Basin includes three basins: Foz do Amazonas, Pará-Maranhão, and Barreirinhas. The area is estimated to hold large oil and gas reserves and is expected to share geology with that of Guyana’s offshore, where Exxon is finding billions of barrels of oil and is developing half a dozen projects. Some in Brazil believe it could be the next presalt zone in terms of production..Meanwhile, Brazil last year updated its reserve estimates, now seeing its proven oil wealth at some 16.8 billion barrels as of 2024, which was up 5.92% on the previous year. The reserve replacement rate in the biggest South American oil producer was also exemplary, at over 176%. And yet, Brazil wants to be a net-zero country by 2050 and reduce its emissions by between 59% and 67% by 2030. In the meantime, it’s expanding a refinery..Related: Brent Drops Below $70 as Israel-Iran Ceasefire Holds.It’s all about energy supply security. The Abreau e Lima refinery is getting $900 million to boost its capacity to 260,000 barrels of crude daily. This will increase local diesel fuel production, reducing dependency on imports. So will new oil exploration in the Fox do Amazonas: Brazil may produce around 3.5 million bpd and consume 2.57 million bpd but it does not have the refineries equipped to process all the crude it produces locally. So it has to import some crude in what looks like a bit of a paradoxical situation..Yet it is also about money. The oil industry in Brazil makes a lot of money—when the market is good—and the net-zero enthusiastic government wants a bigger portion of that.

The developments reflect XOM’s strong focus on generating money for the long term while investing in high-quality projects..Among the key projects, XOM’s new chemical plant in China is worth mentioning.

WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, fell from its peak at above $80 a barrel to a low point of around $60 a barrel due to concerns that President Donald Trump's tariff plan would slow the economy and sap oil demand. However, crude oil has since spiked back into the mid-$70s due to tariff pauses, trade deals, and concerns about supply disruptions due to resurgent conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine..Rising oil prices will enable oil companies to produce more cash, making the sector look like a more compelling investment opportunity these days. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) currently stand out to a few Fool.com contributing analysts as top oil stocks to buy amid the rise in crude prices..Reuben Gregg Brewer (Devon Energy): Energy prices are volatile, which is a simple fact of life in the energy sector. Companies go about dealing with this in different ways. For example, companies like integrated energy giant Chevron work to mitigate the risk by having diversified business models and strong balance sheets. Companies like Devon Energy, a pure-play energy producer, embrace the risk..To be fair, Devon Energy isn't speculating wildly in the hope of hitting the jackpot. It just focuses on controlling what it can by operating a strong energy production business. And it has done so fairly well, noting that it has an attractive break-even price, growing production, and an investment-grade-rated balance sheet..Management simply accepts that the revenue and earnings it generates will fluctuate over time, rising and falling alongside commodity prices. But the company's business model will likely be very attractive to investors looking to benefit from rising oil prices..Basically, Devon Energy is a long-term survivor in the volatile energy sector. And its financial performance will benefit directly from oil price rallies. Which, in turn, means its stock price will tend to rally alongside oil prices. Devon Energy is a higher-risk energy investment, but if you are looking for a way to cash in on higher crude prices, well, it could be a very good option for you.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-spiking-3-top-110000223.html,Market Risk

It's been working to expand in an effort to better compete with energy industry giants.  Energy price swings tend to impact Oxy's share price more than its larger peers.,"Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) is a $45 billion market cap integrated energy company..It's been working to expand in an effort to better compete with energy industry giants..Energy price swings tend to impact Oxy's share price more than its larger peers..10 stocks we like better than Occidental Petroleum ›.Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) has the backing of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. But that alone isn't a reason to buy a stock, particularly one that operates in an industry known for volatility. All in, Occidental Petroleum (commonly known as Oxy) is an interesting mix of risk and reward. That will likely make it a buy right now for some investors and a stock that's best avoided for others..Here's what you need to know..Occidental Petroleum drills for oil and natural gas, which is known as the upstream segment of the broader energy sector. It moves oil and natural gas via energy infrastructure assets like pipelines, which is the midstream. And it processes oil and natural gas into other products in its chemical and refining operations, which is the downstream. Having exposure to all three of the main energy segments makes Oxy an integrated energy company..The largest U.S. integrated energy company is ExxonMobil, which has a roughly $490 billion market capitalization. Next up is Chevron with a market cap of nearly $250 billion. By comparison, Oxy's market cap is a relatively tiny $45 billion. But Occidental Petroleum has big aspirations..Specifically, Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway helped to fund Oxy's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. The most notable fact about this deal is that Chevron had originally been trying to buy Anadarko. With the help of Buffett, Oxy swooped in to win Anadarko over with a sweeter offer. This is an important event that speaks to the difference between relatively tiny Oxy and its larger U.S. integrated energy peers..Buying Anadarko, while something of an eye-catching moment, ended up being a pyrrhic victory. The move required Oxy to take on so much leverage that when oil prices fell in 2020 during the economic shutdowns used to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the company's dividend had to be cut. The shares plunged as investors worried about the company's future. By comparison, both Exxon and Chevron supported their dividend through what ended up being a relatively brief economic dislocation..Oxy's dividend cut, meanwhile, has proven to be something of a turning point. It is now fairly openly focused on growth over returning cash to investors via large dividend payments. Chevron's dividend yield is 4.6%. Exxon's yield is nearly 3.5%. Oxy's yield is just 2.1% or so, though it is worth noting that the dividend is growing again.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-stock-buy-now-104500129.html,Market Risk

Eurasia Group founder and president Ian Bremmer explains why in the video above..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here..Why are markets, uh, you think so resilient here in the morning, uh, this morning after this, these results? .Because the Americans don't want the war to continue. Um, they wanted to be one and done, uh, as Trump did when he assassinated Kasim Suleimani in his first term, and they believe with some evidence, uh, that the Iranians are very risk averse here. Uh, they they don't have much they have been able to do against Israel, uh, and frankly, they have even less that they're capable of doing really against the United States. The markets also are very focused on oil, and so far, Iran's own oil export capabilities have not been touched by the US or by Israel, and and they believe, and I think appropriately, uh, that as long as that is the case, that Iran is very unlikely to severely disrupt, um, the, uh, Straits of Hormuz, uh, which, which is what would lead to a much more significant uptick in the price of oil. Now, all of that does not reflect the fact that the reason the Americans engaged in strikes, in part, is because Iran didn't have the capacity to respond to Trump's entreaties to engage in direct negotiations. They don't, they aren't communicating well internally. They've shut down their internet. They're in hiding. They're not meeting all together. The potential for mistakes and rogue actions in this environment's actually quite high. I think the markets aren't worried about that, but they are pricing in a level of risk aversion, um, and reluctance, um, to precipitate further escalation on the part of the Islamic Republic. .Uh, Ian, you mentioned the Strait of Hormuz. Uh, how important is that for global trade? .Well, it's critical. Uh, it's one of the most important, uh, transit points, bottlenecks, uh, for global energy and a lot of other shipping chemicals, manufacturing, trade and the rest. There are already a number of oil tankers that have, um, changed, uh, their transit plans away from the straits just in the last 24 hours going around, uh, the Cape of Good Hope. It's a lot more expensive, it takes a lot more time, but there's not a belief that it's going to be disrupted by military attacks. And I agree with that assessment at this point. So I'm not surprised that the markets are responding to lots of oil production, relatively soft demand, and not an expectation that the Middle East is going to become a broader conflagration. .Ian, real quick before I let you go. Uh, what is the next big risk off this event that investors need to be, uh, looking for? .Uh, that the Israelis, um, have not decided that this is over. Uh, and they have spoken of regime change in the past. The defense minister has spoken about taking out the Supreme Leader himself. So I think we want to watch very carefully, um, if the country that precipitated these strikes and got the Americans in, Israel, are they prepared to continue to engage in strikes? And what does that do to Iranian capabilities on the ground? What does that do to Iranian leadership? That's the core dynamic of the three parties that are involved in this fighting right now to watch.

36,2025-06-23 21:10:00,What Makes Chevron's Gulf of America Oil Bet So Compelling,"CVX eyes a significant output boost from the Gulf of America by 2026, driven by new deepwater projects like Ballymore and Whale.","Chevron Corporation CVX is leaning heavily on the Gulf of America (GOA) to fuel its next wave of production growth. In April 2025, the company brought first oil online at Ballymore, a key asset expected to produce around 75,000 barrels per day once all three initial wells ramp up. Just months earlier, production began at Whale — another major deepwater project designed for 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) at peak. With multiple phases still ahead, these developments represent the core of Chevron’s plan to reach 300,000 net BOE/d from the GOA by 2026 — a 50% jump from the 2020 levels.Behind the numbers is a broader strategic shift. Chevron is combining decades of operational experience with new technologies to unlock deepwater resources more efficiently. Whale, for example, leverages a simplified facility design and energy-efficient systems to reduce emissions and cost per barrel. Similarly, the high-pressure Anchor platform — operational since August 2024 — is built to handle extreme conditions, with a resource base estimated at 440 million barrels of oil-equivalent. Together, these assets represent some of Chevron’s highest-margin, lowest-carbon barrels globally.This push isn’t just about drilling more — it’s about drilling smarter. Chevron’s updated project models are helping it reduce costs, increase efficiency, and extend the life of its fields. For instance, the Tahiti platform, which has been producing since 2009, has since crossed 500 million barrels and could continue operating into the 2040s. Backed by more efficient designs and low-carbon intensity output, Chevron’s Gulf operations are positioned to remain a strong, high-margin part of its portfolio..Europe’s largest energy major Shell plc SHEL is the largest operator in the GoA, known for pioneering deepwater oil and gas production. Its operations — like Perdido, Vito, Whale, and the upcoming Sparta — showcase advanced, cost-efficient technology. With lower-than-average emissions and a 40% cut in methane since 2016, Shell is pairing innovation with sustainability in one of the world’s most challenging offshore environments. Shell continues to lead with standardized designs, robotics and efficient subsea systems, keeping safety and environmental performance at the core of its offshore strategy.Continental rival BP plc BP is also one of the top oil producers in the GoA, operating major hubs, including Atlantis, Mad Dog and Thunder Horse. With $7 billion in investments through 2025, BP aims to exceed 400,000 BOE/d in production from the region by the end of the decade. BP is also unlocking deep resources through projects like Kaskida, using smart, replicable platform designs for future expansion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-chevrons-gulf-america-oil-131000439.html,Operational Risk
37,2025-06-23 21:00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Chevron Corporation (CVX) is a Trending Stock,"Zacks.com users have recently been watching Chevron (CVX) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Chevron (CVX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this oil company have returned +9.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, which Chevron falls in, has gained 8.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Chevron is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share, indicating a change of -38% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 points to a change of -31.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.8%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.74 indicates a change of +27.2% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Chevron.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-chevron-corporation-130005142.html,Market Risk

Despite the volatility, the oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate has essentially returned (as of June 19) to the level it was at when 2025 began..Investors, consequently, have questioned if now's a good time to fuel their portfolios with some energy exposure -- especially with a position with an energy industry stalwart like Chevron (NYSE: CVX)..But merely because Chevron, with a market cap of $256.7 billion, is an industry leader -- it's one of the largest energy companies based on market cap, in fact -- doesn't mean that it's a definite buy. Let's try to drill down, therefore, and see if today is a good time to click the buy button on Chevron stock..Chevron stock advocates will point to a number of points that illustrate why shares of the oil supermajor are so appealing right now. For one, the company operates throughout the energy value chain, which helps mitigate the risk of any one of its businesses -- from exploration and production to refining -- hitting a downturn..The upstream business is especially robust, and it's expected to continue contributing to Chevron's strong financials. Including the growth of its TCO joint venture in Kazakhstan as well as producing assets in the Permian Basin and Gulf of America, Chevron projects its upstream business will contribute $10 billion in incremental free cash flow in 2026 if oil benchmark Brent Crude averages $70 per barrel, or $9 billion if Brent Crude averages $60 per barrel..The company's strong free cash flow reinforces another great feature of Chevron stock: the dividend. For 38 consecutive years, Chevron has hiked its dividend higher -- a noteworthy feat since management accomplished this throughout the financial crisis and the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. This sincere dedication to rewarding shareholders bodes well for those on the prowl for a resilient passive income play. With a 4.6% forward dividend yield, Chevron stock is certainly attractive, but even more so in light of management's conservative approach: Chevron's payout ratio has averaged 68.4% over the past five years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-one-largest-energy-companies-094600764.html,Stock Volatility Risk

Occidental expects to generate an additional $1.5 billion in free cash flow by 2027 from non-oil sources.,"Warren Buffett has made bold bets on the oil market by investing in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum..Chevron expects to produce an additional $9 billion in free cash flow next year even if oil prices fall..Occidental expects to generate an additional $1.5 billion in free cash flow by 2027 from non-oil sources..10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›.Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), has invested in dozens of stocks. Its portfolio is currently worth over $278 billion. .Two of those stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now: Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). The oil stocks currently trade at lower valuations. With several upside catalysts ahead, they look very attractive these days..Berkshire Hathaway has made a pretty outsized bet on the oil market. Buffett's company holds 6.8% of Chevron's outstanding shares and 26.9% of Occidental's stock. Those positions are worth $17.7 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively. They are Berkshire's fifth and sixth largest holdings at 6.3% and 4.4% of its investment portfolio. .Buffett's company invested in these oil stocks because they provided Berkshire's portfolio with upside exposure to oil prices. Unfortunately, that trade hasn't panned out over the past year as oil has declined, weighing on the value of these oil stocks: .It's anyone's guess where oil prices will go next. The Trump administration's tariff plan was the big downside catalyst in crude prices earlier this year. The market feared the initially high rates would slow the global economy and decrease oil demand. However, with tariff pauses and trade deals, the impact likely won't be as bad as feared. .Meanwhile, supplies could become an issue given the escalating conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Crude prices could soar if tensions continue to rise and attacks spread to oil infrastructure. .Crude prices will continue to play a major role in the performance of oil stocks like Chevron and Occidental. However, both companies have major potential upside catalysts unrelated to oil prices..We'll start with Chevron. The oil giant has completed several major projects recently, including the Future Growth Project in Kazakhstan and Ballymore in the Gulf of Mexico (also known as the Gulf of America in the U.S.). These and other initiatives position Chevron to generate an incremental $9 billion in free cash flow in 2026 at $60 per barrel of oil (crude is currently around $75 per barrel). That will give Chevron more money to return to shareholders via dividend increases (it has raised its payment for 38 straight years and at a peer-leading rate over the past decade) and share repurchases (it's targeting $10 billion to $20 billion annually).

Enterprise, which is a midstream master limited partnership (MLP), has increased its distribution every single year for 26 consecutive years.","Chevron, Enterprise Products Partners, and Enbridge all have above-average yields..All three have strong business models that have supported regular dividend increases..Each of these companies has been awarded top-tier scores for financial strength..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.If you are a dividend lover like I am, then you care a lot about finding stocks with big yields backed by growing dividends. That's what you'll get with Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). However, there's more to understand about a company than just its yield and dividend history. Here's why these three are my top high-yield dividend stocks in the energy sector right now..Before getting into the deeper story, a first cut look at dividends is still important. Enterprise, which is a midstream master limited partnership (MLP), has increased its distribution every single year for 26 consecutive years. Enbridge, a Canadian midstream giant, has increased its dividend (in Canadian dollars) every year for three decades. And Chevron, a globally diversified integrated energy company, has increased its dividend annually for 38 years and counting..Those are all impressive records, but they have to be couched in a very important fact. The energy sector is broadly known for being volatile because oil and natural gas prices are volatile. In other words, this trio has defied the odds when it comes to their ability to reward investors with a steadily growing income stream. And right now, they are each offering something else, too: an above-average yield..The S&P 500 index is yielding roughly 1.2%. The average energy stock is yielding about 3.5%. Chevron's dividend yield is currently around 4.6%, Enbridge's yield is 5.9%, and Enterprise is yielding 6.8%. So you get outstanding dividend histories and outstanding yields if you buy these three energy giants right now..Clearly, there are good reasons to be looking at Chevron, Enterprise, and Enbridge as income investments. But the dividend headlines aren't the whole show. The businesses that back those dividends are just as important, if not more so. For example, Chevron's diversification across the entire energy value chain helps to reduce the impact of energy price volatility. Its chemicals and refining businesses, as a highlight, tend to benefit when oil prices are low, which is a headwind for its energy production operations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-3-high-yield-energy-103000912.html,Market Risk   Business Risk

45,2025-06-20 21:45:00,Can Prairie Operating Co.'s Cost Leadership Set It Apart?,PROP's cost-efficient drilling strategy and vertical integration give it an edge in the DJ Basin.,"Prairie Operating Co. PROP is building its growth strategy around disciplined cost control, a focus that’s quickly becoming one of its most important competitive advantages in the DJ Basin. The company has leaned into operational efficiencies across drilling, completion and production workflows, targeting scalable returns even at mid-cycle commodity prices. Its current one-rig development program emphasizes capital-light execution with a focus on short payback wells, allowing Prairie to maintain flexibility while still expanding volumes.A major contributor to this efficiency is Prairie Operating Co.’s vertical integration and hands-on supply management. The company is actively self-sourcing critical inputs like sand, water and chemicals, reducing exposure to third-party cost inflation and service delays. By deploying proprietary in-basin logistics, PROP minimizes transportation costs and keeps project timelines tight. The company’s development model favors repeatable pad drilling, streamlining both capital intensity and cycle time, especially in its high-return Delaware Basin acreage.What sets Prairie Operating Co. apart is not just what it spends, but how consistently it manages to do more with less. In an industry often shaped by unpredictable price cycles and rising service costs, Prairie’s focus on margin preservation gives it breathing room. As the company scales through 2025, this cost structure offers a buffer against volatility and a platform for reinvestment. For investors and operators alike, Prairie’s approach makes a strong case for capital efficiency as a long-term value driver..Oil production in Colorado’s DJ Basin dates back to the 1970s, but activity has surged in recent years thanks to the involvement of major players like Chevron CVX and Civitas Resources CIVI. Both companies played a critical role in unlocking the basin’s potential, bringing capital, technology, and scale to the region. However, Chevron and Civitas Resources have since turned their attention elsewhere, opening up a rare window of opportunity.Chevron is now focused on high-return global assets and deeper Permian Basin exposure, while Civitas Resources has aggressively shifted its drilling inventory to the Permian, where it now controls over 1,200 locations. With Chevron expanding globally and Civitas Resources consolidating in other basins, competition in the DJ has cooled, leaving Prairie Operating Co. with the space to execute.This diversification by Chevron and Civitas Resources makes Prairie Operating Co.’s strategy especially compelling. With 157 permits and more than 586 gross locations, Prairie is carving out a meaningful position in a basin where consolidation has often commanded a premium.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prairie-operating-co-cost-leadership-134500838.html,no risk

That's leading these energy giants to invest in expanding into lower-carbon energy. .One area both oil stocks are expanding into is lithium, a key ingredient for making batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). Exxon entered the sector in 2023 by acquiring land in Arkansas' Smackover Formation, which is rich in lithium brine. Chevron is now following in Exxon's footsteps by acquiring land in the region to produce lithium. .Chevron has signed two deals to buy leasehold acreage related to the Smackover Formation. It's buying 125,000 net acres across Northeast Texas and Southwest Arkansas from two sellers. The energy company noted that the Smackover Formation underneath this land has high lithium content. The land acquisitions mark Chevron's first step toward establishing a commercial-scale U.S. lithium business. .The energy company would utilize a direct lithium extraction (DLE) process to develop the acreage. DLE is a set of advanced technologies that extract lithium from brines produced from subsurface formations like the Smackover. .While Chevron doesn't have experience producing lithium, the DLE process would enable the company to leverage its subsurface, drilling, and resource extraction capabilities and strengths. That makes lithium production a strong strategic fit for oil companies like Chevron and Exxon. .Chevron's move into the Smackover follows Exxon's prior entry into the lithium supply sector. In 2023, the oil giant reportedly paid around $100 million for more than 120,000 total acres in Arkansas above the Smackover Formation. Exxon drilled its first well in the region that year and aims to begin commercially producing lithium by 2027. It set a bold goal of producing enough lithium by 2030 to supply the auto industry with the metal to meet the manufacturing needs of over 1 million EVs per year. That would make it one of the world's top producers in a very short period. .Exxon has already started signing lithium supply deals with potential customers for its branded product, Mobil Lithium. Last year, it inked a nonbinding agreement with battery parts maker LG Chem to potentially supply 100,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate over several years. LG Chem would use it at its cathode plant in Tennessee, which it expects to complete this year.

Brookfield Renewable and Chevron are both reliable dividend payers.  The S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is trading near all-time highs and has a pretty miserly 1.2% or so dividend yield.","The market has a skinny little 1.2% yield, but you can do better..Brookfield Renewable offers a yield of up to 5.6%, and Chevron has a yield of 4.7%..Brookfield Renewable and Chevron are both reliable dividend payers..10 stocks we like better than Brookfield Renewable ›.The S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is trading near all-time highs and has a pretty miserly 1.2% or so dividend yield. If you are an income investor, that suggests that you have your work cut out for you right now. But there are great investment options with high yields out there if you take the time to look. Two no-brainer choices today, if you have $2,000 or $20,000 to invest, are Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Here's what you need to know..Brookfield Renewable owns a globally diversified portfolio of clean energy assets. On the geographic front, its portfolio spans across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. On the technology front, the business has exposure to hydroelectric, solar, wind, energy storage, and nuclear power assets. It is as close to a one-stop shop as you can get in the renewable energy space..The interesting thing here, however, is that Brookfield Renewable is not a regulated utility. It largely sells its power under long-term contracts to others, including both companies and utilities. This actually gives it a lot of room to grow as the world increasingly shifts from carbon-based fuels toward cleaner alternatives. For example, it recently inked a deal with Microsoft to provide around 10.5 gigawatts of power that the technology giant will use to support its data center build-out. Basically, Brookfield Renewable can grow as it sees fit without having to kowtow to regulators who may put limits on its investment plans..And this brings up another interesting fact: Brookfield Renewable is run by Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM). Brookfield Asset Management has an over-100-year history of investing in infrastructure on a global scale. And it plans to increase its clean-energy investments, where Brookfield Renewable is a key source of funding, by around 100% by 2030. Buying Brookfield Renewable lets you partner with Brookfield Asset Management on that growth..There are two ways to buy in here. Brookfield Renewable Partners has a 5.6% yield. Brookfield Renewable Corporation has a 4.6% dividend yield. Both represent the exact same entity and have the exact same dividend payment. The yield difference is because demand for the corporate share class is higher, which makes sense given that large institutional investors are often barred from owning partnerships.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-no-brainer-high-yield-075000315.html,Investment Risk

The companies have acquired exploration rights to multiple offshore blocks in an auction conducted by the Brazilian government. The state-owned energy company, Petrobras, also won exploration rights for several of these offshore blocks in the Foz do Amazonas basin..The basin is considered a resource-rich area, and it is expected to yield promising exploration results. However, due to its rich biodiversity, the basin is considered environmentally sensitive and is vulnerable to the impacts of oil and gas operations..The auction has garnered significant criticism from environmentalists who have expressed concerns regarding exploration efforts in this basin. Environmentalists have raised concerns regarding the potential contamination of water in this region, which is equally vital for the ecosystem as well as the local Brazilian population. Furthermore, exploration activities may also disrupt the natural ecosystem in the Foz do Amazonas basin..The Brazilian National Petroleum Agency put up 147 blocks for auction in this round. These blocks are located across four major regions (also called plays), which include the Foz do Amazonas basin, with 47 offshore blocks, the Pelotas Basin with 34 blocks, the prolific Santos Basin with 50 blocks, and 16 offshore blocks in the Potiguar Basin. Additionally, the National Petroleum Agency also offered 21 onshore exploration blocks, which lie in the Parecis Basin..A consortium of Petrobras and ExxonMobil has scooped up five offshore blocks in this auction, with the Brazilian state-owned energy firm assuming operatorship. Another consortium involving the two companies has secured five other offshore blocks where XOM will serve as the operator. Chevron has secured nine blocks in this round, as part of a consortium with CNPC, China’s state-owned energy company..These companies plan to explore oil in the Foz do Amazonas basin, which is an environmentally sensitive region due to its close proximity to the Amazon rainforest. This makes oil and gas operations in the region highly controversial. Notably, the rich biodiversity of this region is an important factor that has led to delays in obtaining permits for drilling activities.

57,2025-06-18 21:39:00,CVX or COP - Which Energy Stock Deserves Your Attention?,Chevron's dividend power and global growth compete with ConocoPhillips' LNG scale and capital efficiency edge.,"Chevron Corporation CVX and ConocoPhillips COP are two titans of the U.S. energy sector, each commanding a global footprint and multi-decade track record in upstream oil and gas. While both companies operate extensive assets in the Permian Basin and across key international regions, their strategies diverge in areas like dividend policies, capital discipline, and long-cycle project exposure. As oil markets navigate ongoing price volatility, geopolitical tensions, and shifting demand dynamics, comparing these two names offers investors valuable insight.Both stocks share a common identity as oil-weighted, large-cap producers with diversified portfolios and disciplined capital return frameworks. However, Chevron is more income-focused, with a long history of dividend growth, while ConocoPhillips emphasizes capital efficiency and diversified growth drivers, including LNG and strategic acreage additions. For energy investors balancing the search for reliable yield with long-term capital appreciation in a turbulent macro climate, this matchup is especially relevant.Here’s a closer look at how the two companies stack up across key financial and strategic metrics..Dividend Yield and Defensive Appeal: Chevron’s 4.6% dividend yield stands out as one of the highest in the sector, underpinned by 38 consecutive years of dividend growth. In Q1 2025, the company returned $6.9 billion to its shareholders, balancing $3 billion in dividends with $3.9 billion in buybacks. This income reliability, especially in an uncertain macro backdrop, positions CVX as a compelling option for investors seeking defensive exposure with consistent cash returns.Production Growth: Chevron is ramping up global production, targeting 6-8% growth in 2025. Key contributors include the Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan, Gulf of Mexico deepwater projects like Ballymore and Anchor, and further development in the Permian Basin. The Tengiz project alone, where Chevron holds a 50% stake, has recently hit a significant production milestone, adding momentum to the company’s volume growth story.Cost Discipline and Efficiency Focus: After years of heavy capital investment, Chevron has shifted into a period of efficiency gains. Management expects $2 billion in structural cost savings in 2025, with another $2–$3 billion in efficiencies expected in 2026. These savings, combined with innovations like triple-frac well completion in the Permian, are improving capital efficiency and strengthening free cash flow.Guyana and Global Asset Upside: Chevron’s impending acquisition of Hess would give it access to the prolific Stabroek Block in Guyana — home to more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. This resource, along with stronger output from Chevron’s international assets in Nigeria and Australia, diversifies its upstream base and offsets potential output risk in more mature basins. The deal also strengthens long-term cash flow, with a potential $10 billion boost by 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvx-cop-energy-stock-deserves-133900916.html,Investment Risk

This is a boon for Exxon Mobil Corporation’s XOM exploration and production (E&P) activities, as upstream operations are positively correlated with oil prices. Crude price data are as per Oilprice.com..In other words, with ExxonMobil generating the majority of its earnings from upstream operations, almost 88% in the first quarter of 2025, the rise in oil price is a positive development for its E&P business, aiding its bottom line. Delving into the large integrated energy player’s upstream business, XOM has a strong footprint in the oil-rich Permian, the most prolific basin in the United States. With operations spread across the low-cost basin, the high oil price will likely generate significant cash flows for XOM..To describe XOM’s strong focus on the Permian, the energy giant acquired Pioneer Natural Resources, with integration progressing well, and the company has revised its annual synergy estimates upward from $2 billion to $3 billion for the first decade. Thus, strong Permian operations amid the favorable crude pricing environment are aiding ExxonMobil..Both Chevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP generate significant earnings from their upstream operations, and hence, they benefit from higher oil prices..In the Permian, Chevron’s operations cover approximately 1.8 million net acres within the sub-basins of Delaware and Midland. Being a major player in the region, CVX’s breakeven costs are also low. Hence, it can generate handsome cashflow from a high crude pricing environment. In the first quarter of this year, CVX mentioned that Permian primarily aided its production volumes..BP also has a solid upstream operation, comprising a top-tier oil and gas business in attractive basins. BP is also a low-cost producer. The British energy giant claimed that it has been able to keep the cost of producing oil very low. Thus, BP is among the lowest-cost producers in the industry to capitalize on increasing oil prices..Shares of XOM have gained 7.9% over the past year, outpacing the 3.7% improvement of the composite stocks belonging to the industry..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.From a valuation standpoint, XOM trades at a trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) of 7.06X.

Inc., has significantly advanced its clean energy roadmap through the acquisition of approximately 125,000 net acres of leasehold positions across the Smackover Formation in Northeast Texas and Southwest Arkansas. This bold move marks a transformative shift in Chevron’s portfolio as it commits to a commercial-scale, domestic lithium business, poised to become a key player in the critical minerals sector essential for the electrification era..Chevron U.S.A. has announced the acquisition of substantial acreage from TerraVolta Resources, backed by The Energy & Minerals Group (“EMG”), and East Texas Natural Resources (“ETNR”) LLC. These acquisitions grant Chevron direct access to prime acreage overlying the Smackover Formation, a geologic zone renowned for its high-lithium-content brines. With this transaction, Chevron gains a significant competitive edge in the rapidly growing domestic lithium market..The acquisition is not a short-term resource grab. It reflects a focused, long-term commitment to energy diversification and securing access to critical mineral reserves that are essential to both U.S. energy security and the future of sustainable infrastructure. Chevron is positioning itself not just as an energy company but as a central force in the evolving domestic lithium supply chain..The Smackover Formation is becoming one of North America’s most important lithium-rich geological formations. Known historically for its oil and gas reserves, this deep-seated brine basin is now at the forefront of the lithium revolution. Its high concentrations of lithium combined with favorable geological properties make the Smackover Formation one of the most cost-effective and efficient sources of lithium extraction in the United States..Unlike hard rock lithium mining, which is labor-intensive and environmentally invasive, lithium-rich brines in the Smackover Formation can be processed using advanced extraction technologies that minimize environmental disruption. The formation offers a unique combination of high lithium content and low impurity levels, making it ideal for high-purity lithium production. Chevron’s investment in this region enables it to leverage the existing resource base for a new era of cleaner, more sustainable energy production..At the core of Chevron’s lithium development strategy is the adoption of Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) technology. This advanced process allows lithium to be separated directly from brine in a closed-loop, faster, cleaner and more efficient system than traditional methods. DLE eliminates the need for evaporation ponds, reducing land use and water consumption while significantly shortening production timelines.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-acquires-lithium-rich-acreage-120200651.html,Market Risk Operational Risk Strategic Risk

This expands TotalEnergies' U.S. footprint.,"TotalEnergies SE TTE announced the acquisition of a 25% working interest in a portfolio of exploration leases Offshore U.S. from Chevron Corporation CVX. This deal would increase TotalEnergies' offshore U.S. exploration acreage, combining a variety of geological features and prospectivity, and is consistent with the ongoing objective of expanding its exploration portfolio with low-cost and low-emission choices.Additionally, TotalEnergies is increasing its presence in Southeast Asia by acquiring interests in blocks offshore Malaysia and Indonesia from PETRONAS, with a focus on gas and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”).TotalEnergies is deploying its integrated energy model across the United States, where it has been active since 1957. Since 2022, TotalEnergies has invested nearly $11 billion in the United States to accelerate development in oil, LNG and low-carbon electricity..The 40 federal leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, which cover an area of about 386 square miles (1,000 square kilometers) and are situated between109 and 205 miles (175 and 330 km) offshore, consist of 18 blocks in the East Breaks area, nine in the Mississippi Canyon area, and 13 in the Walker Ridge area.In addition to the current partnerships in Ballymore (40% TotalEnergies), which achieved first production this year, Anchor (37.14%), where production began last year, and the Jack (25%) and Tahiti (17%) producing assets, the transaction gives access to multiple offshore exploration plays and prospects, bolstering the successful U.S. collaboration with Chevron.TotalEnergies expects to mature exploration drill decisions on these blocks utilizing advanced 3D imaging technology to unlock large remaining U.S. Offshore production potential..The offshore assets of oil and gas companies provide several benefits, primarily through access to vast and untapped resources under the ocean floor. The offshore fields play a crucial role in meeting the growing global demand for energy and ensuring a steady, reliable supply of oil and gas for both domestic and international markets. Along with TTE and Chevron, some companies like Petrobras PBR and ExxonMobil Corporation XOM are also focused on offshore exploration opportunities. Chevron is actively pursuing offshore exploration, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern Mediterranean. Its renewed interest effectively doubles the area available for exploration, expanding the offshore blocks to a vast 47,000 square kilometers (18,146 square miles). This not only increases the possibility of finding commercially viable energy reserves but also opens up opportunities for both CVX and Greece’s energy future.CVX’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 8.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 sales indicates a year-over-year decrease of 6.2%.Petrobras is actively evaluating opportunities in India’s upcoming oil block auction, signaling a strategic interest in expanding its offshore exploration portfolio beyond South America.

Chevron has a high yield, and its stock has lagged behind its closest peer.","The ups and downs of energy stocks are largely driven by oil and natural gas prices..Energy is out of favor at the moment, leaving a large number of energy companies lower..Chevron has a high yield, and its stock has lagged behind its closest peer..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.The energy sector is volatile. That's a fact of investing life that anyone looking at the space needs to clearly understand. But not all energy companies are alike, and that can open up opportunities for investors that can see past what are sometimes headline-grabbing energy swings, like the price reversals that have taken place in recent days..Right now, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one high-yield energy laggard that is worth buying and holding for the long term..The first thing that investors need to understand is that oil prices can rise and fall in often dramatic, and swift, fashion. Even when the moves aren't rapid, they can still be material..During the coronavirus pandemic, oil prices plunged. Coming out of the pandemic, they rallied strongly. And after peaking in 2022, oil prices slowly declined by around 50%. Even after the recent price rise on geopolitical concerns, oil prices are still down nearly 50%..That has had a notable impact on energy stocks, which as a group are down a touch over 10%, using Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF as an industry proxy. Chevron, however, is down a bit more than 20% from its peak..What's interesting is that Chevron's closest peer is fellow U.S. integrated energy giant ExxonMobil, which has fallen about as much as the brother energy group. In other words, Chevron is a laggard..Exxon and Chevron are both integrated energy companies. That means they have exposure to the entire energy value chain. This provides material balance to their businesses, since each segment of the energy industry (the upstream, midstream, and downstream) operates a little differently. This diversification helps to smooth out the industry's commodity driven ups and downs..Moreover, Exxon and Chevron both have very strong balance sheets. Exxon's debt-to-equity ratio is an ultra-low 0.15x, while Chevron's is close behind at 0.2x. Both have much stronger financial positions than European peers BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies. This gives Exxon and Chevron a greater ability to lean on their balance sheets during energy downturns to support their businesses and dividends..Exxon has increased its dividend for an incredible 43 consecutive years. But Chevron is no slouch, with a dividend streak of 38 years. In many ways, Exxon and Chevron are very similar businesses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-magnificent-high-yield-energy-114900661.html,Market Risk   Liquidity Risk   Operational Risk   Business/Strategic Risk

Meanwhile, Wildfires in Canada have disrupted about 350,000 barrels of oil production per day, and OPEC has failed to reach an agreement to increase global output..Despite dipping over 1% on Monday, WTI crude prices have spiked 15% in the last month to over $70 a barrel, and Global Partners could be in a prime position to capitalize..Image Source: Trading Economics.Having liquid energy terminals that span from Maine to Florida via rail, pipelines, and marine assets, Global Partners stores and distributes gasoline, distillates, residual oil, and renewable fuels. .Attributed to its strategic expansion and operational execution, GLP has a total return of +23% in 2025, when including dividends. Notably, Global Partners' total return has impressively topped the broader market and its Zacks Oil Refining & Marketing MLP peers, along with the performance of oil conglomerates Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .Making GLP of interest to income investors and correlating with Global Partners' pleasant total return is that MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships) don’t pay corporate tax and are incentivized to pass their income directly to shareholders to retain this tax advantage..Most MLPs typically allocate 80%-90% of their cash flow to investors, with GLP currently having a 94% payout ratio.

75,2025-06-16 20:09:00,Chevron's Permian Wells Deliver More - With Less Spending,"CVX boosts Permian output with 20% less reinvestment, leaning on high-return wells in New Mexico's Delaware Basin.","Chevron Corporation’s CVX operations in the Permian Basin are showing strong results, and the company is doing it with less money. The energy supermajor expects its oil and gas production to witness a 5-6% CAGR through 2026, while cutting its reinvestment rate by about 20% compared to 2024. That means it’s spending less but still getting more output. A big part of this success comes from better-performing wells in New Mexico’s Delaware Basin, which now makes up 85% of its new development plans.In 2024, Chevron brought 244 company-operated wells online, including 90 in New Mexico. Those wells produced better than expected, helping to lower costs and increase returns. As a result, the company expects its free cash flow from the Permian to grow by nearly $2 billion by the end of 2026. And because a significant portion of Chevron’s acreage in the area has little or no royalty payments, it keeps more of the revenues from each barrel it produces.This approach reflects Chevron’s focus on doing more with less. Rather than chasing growth at any cost, the company is improving how wells are drilled, cutting down on waste, and choosing high-return areas. The Permian Basin continues to be a key part of Chevron’s business, and by improving efficiency and lowering costs, the company is turning it into a reliable source of cash for the long term..ExxonMobil XOM, Chevron’s primary competitor, has aggressively ramped up its Permian presence through acquisitions, most notably its $63 billion buyout of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2024. This move expanded ExxonMobil’s footprint to more than 1.3 million net acres and significantly boosted output.In 2024, ExxonMobil’s Permian production averaged 1.185 million BOE/d, up 570,000 from the prior year. The company plans to double that to 2.3 million BOE/d by 2030. To get there, it’s using advanced methods like special proppants and cube drilling, and it aims to cut emissions to net zero in its original Permian operations by 2030 and in Pioneer’s by 2035.Another energy biggie, EOG Resources EOG, holds a dominant position in the Delaware Basin, utilizing advanced drilling techniques to maximize well productivity and returns. In 2024, EOG Resources’ Permian assets drove 3% oil production growth and an 8% increase in total volumes. By leveraging proprietary technology and self-sourced materials, EOG Resources maintains a breakeven price in the low-$50s, ensuring consistent free cash flow and attractive shareholder returns..Shares of Chevron have lost around 5% in the past year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevrons-permian-wells-deliver-more-120900261.html,Operational Risk

His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns 118.6 million shares of the oil giant, or about 6.8% of its outstanding stock. Those shares are currently worth $17.1 billion. That makes Chevron Berkshire's fifth largest holding, at 6.1% of its investment portfolio. .A big draw of Chevron is its high-yielding dividend. It supplies Berkshire with over $800 million in dividend income each year. However, Chevron isn't the only high-yielding dividend stock in the energy sector. Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as even better energy stocks to buy for a high-yielding income stream..Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enbridge): Buffett's portfolio contains both public companies and a huge and varied collection of fully owned businesses. Energy is a big theme across both, with particular emphasis on utilities and midstream assets in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of owned businesses. Canada's Enbridge can give you exposure to both in one high-yield energy investment, given its lofty 5.9% yield..The core of Enbridge's business is its midstream portfolio -- largely oil and natural gas pipeline and transportation assets -- which makes up around 75% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The rest of the business is split between natural gas utilities and clean energy assets. What's notable here is that shifting along with the world's energy needs is a core business approach, so the current split will probably continue to shift in a ""clean"" direction. That means you can own Enbridge for decades to come and not have to worry that it will be left behind as energy sources such as solar and wind power grow..The best part of the story, however, is the reliable dividend growth Enbridge has achieved. It has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years. And while rapid dividend growth isn't likely, slow and steady is set to continue for the foreseeable future. Management's goal is distributable cash flow growth of roughly 5% a year through the end of the decade, with dividends likely to trail that figure higher over time. A huge yield and steady dividend growth from industries that Buffett likes is kind of hard to ignore.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-owns-chevron-buy-120600018.html,Market Risk   Investment Risk
77,2025-06-16 20:03:00,Chevron Shuts Down Leviathan Gas Field Amid Rising Tensions,"CVX halts operations at Israel's Leviathan gas field amid rising regional tensions, sparking global energy supply concerns.","Chevron Corporation CVX, a Houston, TX-based integrated oil and gas company, has confirmed the complete shutdown of its massive Leviathan gas field, situated in the Levant Basin off Israel’s coast. This development comes in response to an emergency directive issued by Israel’s Energy Ministry, due to growing national security concerns following escalating tensions with Iran. The Leviathan shutdown has led to an immediate halt in natural gas exports to Egypt, a critical regional energy partner, thereby destabilizing energy markets from the Eastern Mediterranean to Europe..Israel’s Leviathan gas field is its most significant energy asset, containing an estimated 22.9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. Since commencing production, Leviathan has played a key role in positioning Israel as a regional energy powerhouse. In 2024, the field had been exporting a record 981 million cubic feet per day to Egypt, marking an 18% increase from 2023, according to official production figures..With Leviathan now offline, a substantial portion of Israel’s export capacity is effectively frozen, disrupting the critical energy-supply chain that connects the Mediterranean to North Africa and Europe. While other offshore platforms such as Chevron’s Tamar field and Energean’s Karish field continue to operate for domestic use, Leviathan’s scale makes its absence deeply consequential..Egypt has become heavily reliant on Israel’s natural gas imports to supplement its declining domestic production and support both domestic consumption and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export ambitions. The sudden halt in Leviathan’s exports threatens to overburden Egypt’s already strained power infrastructure, especially as summer energy demands peak..Industry sources indicate that Egypt may be forced into emergency LNG procurement, a costly move that could worsen global gas market tightness. LNG traders are already anticipating higher spot prices. Cairo may need to divert LNG originally intended for export toward its own population, a measure that would reverberate through the market of Europe..The immediate fallout from Leviathan’s shutdown was evident in Europe’s energy markets, where natural gas prices surged up to 6.6% within hours of the announcement. With European buyers seeking diversified energy sources amid ongoing supply constraints, the Leviathan disruption compounds existing volatility. Europe's dependence on Mediterranean and Middle Eastern energy corridors means any regional instability, especially one involving a major field like Leviathan, can send shockwaves across the continent.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-shuts-down-leviathan-gas-120300300.html,Geopolitical Risk Supply Chain Risk Market Risk

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?.AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together..The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2025 Chevron had debt of US$29.7b, up from US$21.8b in one year. However, it does have US$4.64b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$25.0b..The latest balance sheet data shows that Chevron had liabilities of US$35.7b due within a year, and liabilities of US$70.6b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$4.64b as well as receivables valued at US$19.5b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$82.2b..While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Chevron has a huge market capitalization of US$254.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.. See our latest analysis for Chevron .In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-nyse-cvx-pretty-healthy-110015732.html,reduced credit risk

The escalation has rattled global markets, driving WTI crude futures up by nearly 7% as investors brace for potential supply disruptions and broader regional fallout..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.In times like these, energy producers with lean, efficient upstream operations and strong capital discipline are in a prime position to capitalize. Elevated crude prices can quickly widen margins, making these companies especially attractive. No surprise, then, that energy stocks are drawing renewed investor interest right now..Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pinpointed two heavyweight energy names that look poised to benefit from this oil shock. Let’s take a closer look..ExxonMobil (XOM).We’ll start with a titan of the global energy sector, ExxonMobil. As the largest oil and gas company in the U.S., it commands a market cap of $483 billion, and over the four quarters ending with Q1 2025, it raked in ~$340 billion in revenue..The company’s edifice is built on the sound execution of its core business: the discovery, extraction, transport, and delivery of hydrocarbon resources. ExxonMobil is a major global producer of oil and natural gas, and also has a leading role in the petrochemical industry and the production of industrial chemicals. The company is also known for its work with lightweight plastics featuring reduced environmental footprints..ExxonMobil is working to expand its oil production, the foundation that supports its business edifice. It announced the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in the autumn of 2023, and since then has been integrating Pioneer’s upstream assets into its own network. On an immediate practical level, this gives ExxonMobil an expanded presence in the Texas Permian Basin, one of the richest oil and gas regions in North America. The company is leveraging this position as part of its broader growth strategy and is targeting a total production level of 5.4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2030..Turning to the financials, we find that ExxonMobil reported $83.13 billion in total revenue for 1Q25, a figure that was roughly flat year-over-year but missed the forecast by $2.96 billion. At the bottom line, the company realized a non-GAAP EPS of $1.76, down 30 cents per share from 1Q24 but 3 cents per share ahead of the estimates.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-jump-israel-strikes-020640894.html,Commodity Price Risk   Systemic Risk   Sovereign Risk

The fund could deliver robust returns in the long term and provide its investors with lots of dividend income when they need it.  Investing a little bit of money each month can really add up over the long term, especially if you invest it wisely.","The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF invests in high-quality dividend growth stocks..These companies have generally produced strong total returns over time..The fund could deliver robust returns in the long term and provide its investors with lots of dividend income when they need it..10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ›.Investing a little bit of money each month can really add up over the long term, especially if you invest it wisely. One of the smartest categories of long-term investments has been dividend stocks, particularly those that steadily increase their payments. Over the last 50 years, dividend growers have delivered an average annual return of 10.2%, according to data from Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research. That's more than twice the 4.3% average return of non-dividend payers. .The easiest way to tap into the power of dividend stocks is by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that's focused on them. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) is one of the top dividend ETFs. By investing $250 a month into this ETF, you could grow your position in it to $923,000 in 30 years. Further, this investment could produce almost $37,000 in annual dividend income at that value. That could really help provide you with a more comfortable retirement..The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index, which aims to measure the performance of higher-yielding dividend stocks with track records of consistently paying dividends that grow over time. The index screens companies based on several dividend quality characteristics, including yield and five-year dividend growth rate. .In a nutshell, its components are 100 of the best dividend stocks in the country. At its annual reconstitution at the end of March, the fund's holdings had an average yield of 3.8% and had grown their payouts by an average of 8.4% over the past five years. That yield is nearly triple the S&P 500's 1.3% yield today, and the growth rate is also above the S&P 500's average of 5% over the past five years. .The fund's top holdings are a who's who of leading dividend stocks. For example, its second-largest holding is Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The beverage giant has increased its payouts for 63 years in a row, including by 5.2% earlier this year. That streak puts Coca-Cola in the elite category of Dividend Kings -- companies that have boosted their payouts annually for 50 straight years or more. It distributed $8.4 billion in dividends last year and has paid out $93.1 billion since 2010. With its robust and growing cash flows, Coca-Cola should have no trouble continuing to increase its dividend, which has a yield of 2.8% at the current share price.

81,2025-06-15 07:00:00,How the U.S. is Handing Over Venezuela’s Oil Sector to China,"While not officially taking over Chevron’s assets, Chinese companies like China Concord Petroleum and Anhui Guangda Mining are signing secretive production-sharing deals to operate oil fields and pursue greenfield projects.","After coming into office, the administration of President Donald Trump has eliminated licenses for oil companies to operate in Venezuela, despite initial hints that it would continue them, with presidential envoy Richard Grenell’s visits to Caracas. This means that sanctions on state-owned PDVSA are fully back on. Chevron, the main U.S. corporation on the ground, is back to having only a secret license for minimum maintenance and security, as it still a shareholder in four joint ventures..In the last few months, this has sparked a question. Is the U.S. government leaving the South American country at the mercy of Beijing? Could Chinese companies replace Chevron in Venezuela?.There are two short answers. In terms of oil exports, yes. And this has already happened. Before the first round of economic and financial sanctions hit in 2017, the U.S. took almost 800,000 barrels per day from Venezuela. This figure went all the way down to zero in 2019, with the highest level of restrictions known as “maximum pressure.” This happened again in May of this year, as Chevron, Repsol and others were blocked by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)..So, where does all the oil go? In past years, Caracas was able to strike agreements with Rosneft or with Indian buyers. But as the U.S. introduced secondary sanctions, and now secondary tariffs, there was only one buyer left, the only one that does not fear Washington’s threats: China..Reuters has already reported that crude that was produced in joint ventures with Chevron has been on its way to East Asia. And the Chinese market does have the capacity to absorb Venezuelan oil. The only problem is how much PDVSA gets paid, when there is only one buyer on the block—a monopsony..When it comes down to Chinese companies taking over Chevron’s operations, this is unlikely to happen in the near to medium term. More than anything else, because it does not need to happen for Beijing to expand its influence and control. The same goes for Moscow or Iran..First, investors have plenty of options before them, from greenfield opportunities to mature fields that only need repairs. Venezuela has thousands of square kilometres with billions of barrels of oil underneath. And most joint ventures are effectively dormant: just 20 out of 64 areas of operation are producing more than 10,000 barrels per day of crude, while most are stuck at 0 or below the 1,000 mark..Second, regime officials will prefer to keep the fields where Chevron invested for themselves. 240,000 barrels per day is a great business opportunity. This means millions of dollars in contracts for goods and services, that used to be managed by a foreign corporation—not anymore, courtesy of President Trump.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-handing-over-venezuela-oil-230000479.html,Geopolitical Risk   Transparency Risk

Exponential AI demand growth is driving this company's end-market growth.  With the first half of 2025 nearly over, many investors are taking time to reevaluate their portfolios and take advantage of quality stocks that can be bought at a discount.","If investors can see past the downturn in energy prices, Chevron stock is a great opportunity..Exponential AI demand growth is driving this company's end-market growth..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.With the first half of 2025 nearly over, many investors are taking time to reevaluate their portfolios and take advantage of quality stocks that can be bought at a discount. It certainly requires some confidence to buy shares of a company when they're down, but it's opportunities like these that offer the potential for outsize returns..Two Fool.com contributors, for example, recognize that oil supermajor Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and data center equipment provider Vertiv (NYSE: VRT) are two worthy considerations for investors to click the buy buttons on right now since they're stocks are trading down 23% and 26%, respectively, from recent all-time highs..Scott Levine (Chevron): While the 23% decline in Chevron stock from its all-time high in January 2023 may be disconcerting, the truth is that the stock's fall isn't wholly unexpected. There's a strong correlation between the movements of energy prices and those of energy stocks, so when investors pair Chevron stock's plunge with the 22% dip in the price of oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate during the same time period, the performance in Chevron's stock becomes much more understandable..Whether you're on the prowl for a reliable dividend stock or a steady energy stock or something in between, Chevron fits the bill. For 38 consecutive years, the company has hiked its dividend -- a notable achievement for any company but especially one whose business revolves around commodities along with their cyclical prices. Lest investors fear that the company is sacrificing its financial health to placate shareholders, a peek at Chevron's average payout ratio over the past five years should allay their concerns: It's a conservative 68.4%..Unlike some companies that solely focus on exploration and production, or those with midstream businesses, or downstream operations, Chevron operates throughout the energy value chain. This provides it with the ability to benefit from greater efficiencies than companies with more concentrated operations, as well as mitigating the risks associated with a slowing in the business of any one link in the energy value chain..For those looking to put some pep in their passive income streams, now seems like a great time to gas up on Chevron stock.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-down-23-26-111300334.html,Market Risk   Sector Risk   Speculative Risk

How should investors be really analyzing the US specific energy sector names? .Yeah, so with Exxon, uh, specifically, it's worth mentioning that they have a lot of production in the uh, in cutter gas. Uh, it's a very significant part of excellent earnings, uh, which is obviously in the midst of the, uh, uh, the conflict. Uh, cutter shares the North field with Iran, uh, and a lot of the exports go through the straight of Hormuz. So there's some risk there. Chronicle Philips, um, and Shell Total all have uh, participations in that field. Uh, when you look at Oxy or Chevron, they have less exposure to that area. Oxy is probably even the least out of all of them. Uh, you know, I mentioned all the pure US EMPs. I think they get more of that leverage. Um, and also because on the refining segment, where Exxon, Chevron, uh, BP, they're all exposed there, I think this is negative for the refining segment. Uh, and so the pure oil and P's tend to do better in this, uh, overshoot of oil. .Fernando, I wonder, from what you've been able to analyze in prior instances, how long is the tail in terms of the impact that we're talking about after the initial strikes and event that sparks the volatility to the point where we eventually see some falling action, but perhaps there's still a little bit of overhang until there's real resolution that seems like it might be emerging. .It's typically not long. Um, and uh, you've seen it with the attacks in Saudi Arabia a few years ago, um, and then with the the October 7th. This this lasts a little bit, you know, I have a friend who always says, oil always overshoots, and uh, typically wars and attacks are a good time for you to sell, uh, because you get that that opportunity to sell into, into strength. Uh, so we'll have to see here how how long the the attacks go on, uh, but typically it does not take long after, um, these initial skirmishes, uh, before, uh, it it reverses. Uh, I'll say you you talked about oil, some prognosis that we're going to $120 a barrel. Uh, as the your previous guest was saying, the issue is that the consumer can't really afford that uh, level of pricing. And so demand would come down significantly. So I I would put a very short, um, I I I don't think that's a very likely, uh, occurrence that we'll get to those levels unless there's a significant shift in the economy.

One of his energy investments is a more aggressive growth stock; the other is a shockingly reliable dividend stock.  Warren Buffett is the incredibly successful CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).,"Warren Buffett owns two energy stocks..One of his energy investments is a more aggressive growth stock; the other is a shockingly reliable dividend stock..Most investors should find the boring income stock to their liking..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.Warren Buffett is the incredibly successful CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). The stocks his company owns tend to receive plenty of extra attention from investors who want to mimic his investment approach (and match the level of returns Berkshire manages)..There's a dichotomy today in the energy sector, in which Buffett owns two very different energy stocks. Which of these energy stocks is the better option for your portfolio?.Warren Buffett is the CEO of a company that is run more like a mutual fund than a business. In fact, the conglomerate owns around 200 companies if you include both controlled businesses and publicly traded stocks in the mix. The real key here, however, is that Buffett doesn't tend to get into the day-to-day operations of the businesses in which he's invested..Like a mutual fund manager, Buffett buys companies when he thinks they are attractively priced. Then he lets the management team run them, only stepping in if asked or when there is a dire need for his input (notably poor performance, for example). Mostly, he just sits back and benefits from the long-term growth of the businesses in which Berkshire is invested..Buffett's investment approach is important to understand if you are going to use his portfolio as a starting point for your own stock selections. But his penchant for owning stocks for the long term means the current list isn't necessarily filled with stocks you should buy today. That said, the energy sector is a little out of favor right now, so there are potential bargains to be had. Two potential examples are Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX)..Occidental Petroleum is an interesting story because Buffett helped the energy company outbid Chevron for Anadarko Petroleum a few years ago. That purchase ended up being a big stretch for Oxy, as it is more commonly known. When oil prices fell during the coronavirus pandemic, a highly leveraged balance sheet led Oxy to cut its dividend. The dividend is still below where it was prior to the cut. Oxy is very clearly focused on growing its business and has inked several more acquisitions now that its finances are in better shape. This is a stock that more aggressive investors will find attractive.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-warren-buffett-stock-buy-083500315.html,Investment Recommendation Risk

TotalEnergies is also an international energy giant with a 6.5% dividend yield.  Chevron has a long streak of annual dividend increases, but TotalEnergies has a growing electricity division.","Chevron is an international energy giant with a 4.8% dividend yield..TotalEnergies is also an international energy giant with a 6.5% dividend yield..Chevron has a long streak of annual dividend increases, but TotalEnergies has a growing electricity division..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.For investors, choosing between two similar companies to add to a portfolio can be a challenging process. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) offer a great example of this. Both are integrated energy giants. Both stocks offer high yields. But they have slightly different positive and negative attributes. So which one might be the better fit for your dividend portfolio?.As integrated energy companies, Chevron and TotalEnergies have operations in the upstream segment (oil and natural gas production), the midstream segment (energy transportation), and the downstream segment (chemicals and refining). Each part of the energy industry operates a little differently from the others, and having exposure across all of them helps soften the impacts that volatile commodity prices can have on their results..Oil and natural gas prices are still the main driver of each company's financial results, and have huge impacts on their stock prices. But compared to pure-play drillers or chemical companies, Chevron and TotalEnergies tend to get through the typical energy cycle more easily. Each of these companies also has material geographic diversification. That said, Chevron is a U.S. company and it tends to have more exposure to its home market. TotalEnergies is a French company and it tends to have more exposure to Europe. Overall, however, the energy businesses are fairly similar..But these two companies are not interchangeable. That is highlighted by the fact that at their current share prices, Chevron's dividend yield is 4.8% and TotalEnergies yield is 6.5%. And the differences matter here..If you are an income investor, you'll be interested to know that Chevron has increased its dividend annually for 38 consecutive years. That's an impressive record given the inherent volatility of the energy sector. TotalEnergies's track record isn't as impressive, but it has gone through different dividend policies. Like most European companies it was a semi-annual payer before more recently shifting to quarterly payments. And for a stretch it targeted a set percentage of free cash flow, which meant its dividend varied. However, it has paid dividends for decades and more recently has focused on a progressive dividend, meaning it has been steadily increasing its payouts of late.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-energy-stock-totalenergies-vs-222300616.html,Investment Risk

Given that the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has declined more than 7% since the beginning of the year, XOM’s exploration and production business is likely to take a hit..The latest short-term energy outlook from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reveals that the WTI spot average price in 2025 will be $62.33 per barrel, lower than $76.60 per barrel last year. The price of the commodity for 2026 is projected to further fall at $55.58 per barrel. Increasing inventories of oil across the world are leading to declining oil prices..Undoubtedly, the declining oil prices are adversely impacting ExxonMobil’s upstream business and will continue doing so. Now, the billion-dollar question is: To what extent? Given that XOM has a significant presence in the Permian – the most prolific basin in the United States – where the breakeven costs are significantly lower than the prices at which analysts expect oil prices to trade, the largest integrated energy player is unlikely to witness a loss from its upstream operations. However, profits are expected to get squeezed following lower crude prices..Both Chevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP generate significant earnings from their upstream operations, and hence are bearing the blow of softer oil prices..In the Permian, Chevron’s operations cover approximately 1.8 million net acres within the sub-basins of Delaware and Midland. Being a major player in the region, the breakeven costs of CVX are also low to combat the softer crude pricing environment. In the first quarter of this year, CVX mentioned that Permian primarily aided its production volumes..BP also has solid upstream operations, comprising a top-tier oil and gas business in attractive basins. BP is also a low-cost producer. The British energy giant claimed that it has been able to keep the cost of producing oil very low. Thus, BP is among the lowest-cost producers in the industry..Shares of XOM have gained only 1.6% year to date, outpacing the 0.9% improvement of the composite stocks belonging to the industry..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.From a valuation standpoint, XOM trades at a trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) of 6.65X.

In a video issued on April 29, Wirth noted a concerning rise in serious near-misses and stressed the importance of reinforcing safety standards. His message, titled ""Do it safely or not at all,"" urged employees to increase the safety practices, irrespective of facing the challenges inside and outside Chevron..On May 20, a fire erupted on Chevron’s deepwater platform 60 miles off Angola’s coast, killing three workers and injuring 15. The tragedy struck shortly after Chevron’s cost-cutting announcement in February, which included laying off up to 20% of its workforce. The incident has sparked an ongoing investigation and some injured workers remain under medical care..Clay Neff, Chevron’s newly appointed upstream president, echoed Wirth’s concerns in a May 30 video. He highlighted that many incidents were close calls involving routine tasks, emphasizing that proper planning, risk awareness and the right skills are vital. Neff lays emphasis on employees’ lives, saying that all the staff going back home safely is all that matters to them.

Win Big With Its DJ Basin Land Grab?,"Through three major deals, PROP has built a decade-long drilling inventory in Colorado's DJ Basin.","Prairie Operating Co. PROP has quickly positioned itself as the most aggressive consolidator in the northern Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. Over the past year and a half, PROP completed three major acquisitions — Genesis, Nickel Road and Bayswater — spreading over 54,000 net acres and establishing an approximately 10-year runway of high-graded inventory. Colorado’s DJ Basin is a geologically attractive area with supportive local policies and proximity to infrastructure. The DJ Basin also benefits from a regional gas market that imports from Canada, potentially offering better pricing than the oversupplied Texas gas markets.In particular, the $603 million Bayswater transaction marks a game-changing move. The deal expanded Prairie Operating Co.’s production footprint to 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) and added 600 drilling locations across 24,000 net acres in Colorado’s DJ Basin — an area known for stability, efficiency and favorable permitting. With built-in efficiencies and immediate free cash flow generation, this move enhances operational leverage and financial stability.With an expected adjusted EBITDA of $350-$370 million post-acquisition, Houston-based Prairie Operating Co. anticipates strong free cash flow generation, reinforcing its ability to fund future growth without excessive debt. Overall, these acquisitions offer scale and resource leverage that could materially change PROP’s production profile..While oil production in the DJ Basin began in the 1970s, activity has accelerated significantly in recent years. This growth is driven by the presence of major operators such as Chevron CVX and Civitas Resources CIVI. What makes PROP’s bold bet on DJ Basin consolidation compelling is the lack of near-term competition. Larger players like Chevron and Civitas Resources have shifted focus to other basins, leaving Prairie Operating Co. with a relatively open field. While Civitas Resources’ inventory now includes 1,200 locations in the Permian, Chevron spans almost every corner of the globe.That gives Prairie Operating Co. a rare chance to build scale and optionality in a region where consolidation has historically come at a premium. With more than 586 gross locations and 157 permits already in hand, PROP’s platform now resembles a mini-major within its niche, and its appetite for further deals appears intact..Shares of Prairie Operating Co. have lost more than 40% year to date..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prairie-operating-co-win-big-115300267.html,Operational Risk Market Risk Financial Risk Regulatory Risk

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is loaded with blue chip stocks. It stands to reason that many Dow stocks should pay dividends that investors like..Granted, most stocks in the Dow Jones have high dividend yields, which, in my definition, must be at least twice the dividend yield of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). However, some do. Here are the three highest-paying dividend stocks in the Dow -- and whether they're smart picks to buy right now..Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) easily ranks as the Dow's highest-paying dividend stock, with a forward dividend yield of 6.21%. Even better, the company has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years..Most investors are probably quite familiar with Verizon. The company provides broadband and wireless services to millions of customers worldwide. Verizon was founded in 2000 with the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE..Some dividend stocks have high yields because their share prices have plunged. That isn't the case with Verizon, though. Its shares have jumped 9% year to date, a solid performance amid the stock market volatility..Verizon's gains in 2025 and its ability to pay attractive dividends year after year are due to the company's underlying business strength. In the first quarter of 2025, Verizon generated industry-leading wireless service revenue. It posted the most wireless retail core prepaid net additions since 2021. The company also expanded its broadband market share..Chevron (NYSE: CVX) comes in second place with its forward dividend yield of 4.81%. The company has an even more impressive dividend track record than Verizon, raising its dividend 38 years in a row..The No. 2 spot is a familiar one for Chevron: It's also the second-largest U.S. oil company based on market cap, trailing only ExxonMobil. Chevron's roots date back to 1879 with the establishment of the Pacific Oil Company..Dividends aren't the only way Chevron rewards shareholders. In the first quarter of 2025, the oil and gas giant spent $3.9 billion on stock buybacks. That's a higher amount than the $3 billion Chevron paid out in dividends during Q1..Shareholders can probably count on more of the same going forward.

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.55%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.63%..Heading into today, shares of the oil company had lost 0.61% over the past month, lagging the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 3% and the S&P 500's gain of 6.29% in that time..The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Chevron in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.58, reflecting a 38.04% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $46.98 billion, down 8.21% from the prior-year quarter..Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.87 per share and revenue of $190.14 billion. These totals would mark changes of -31.64% and -6.24%, respectively, from last year..Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Chevron. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability..Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system..The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 6.91% decrease. Chevron is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)..In terms of valuation, Chevron is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.49. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.33..Investors should also note that CVX has a PEG ratio of 2.47 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.78 as of yesterday's close.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-cvx-beats-stock-market-214517610.html,no risk

But Where?.Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico.California Pitches Emergency Loans for LA, Local Transit Systems.Producers in the body of water — which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America — will bring on 300,000 barrels of new daily output this year and a further 250,000 barrels in 2026 due to projects many years in the making, according to forecaster Wood Mackenzie Ltd. These will increase production in the region to more than 2 million barrels a day, about 40% higher than in 2020..The growth comes against a backdrop of slowing US shale production due to weaker oil prices, as onshore producers cut rigs and costs to counter rising supplies from OPEC and its allies. Overall US production will decline 0.4% to 13.37 million barrels a day next year, the first drop since 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday..The Gulf’s rising importance represents a turnaround from the past two decades, when the region — tarnished by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, spiraling costs and pandemic shutdowns — took a backseat to the shale boom that has made the US the world’s largest oil producer. But now tumbling crude prices are hurting shale drillers while major, longer-term Gulf projects are starting to come online..“Most people are focused on onshore, when the real growth this year will come from offshore,” Miles Sasser, a senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in an interview. “The projects in the Gulf of America are ramping up nicely, and that should come as a surprise to many.”.Trump has promised to unleash US oil and gas production, and his administration is reworking policies to help boost flows, including from the Gulf.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Chevron (CVX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this oil company have returned -0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Chevron belongs, has remained unchanged over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Chevron is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share, indicating a change of -38% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.8% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.6%. This estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.74 indicates a change of +27.2% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -15%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Chevron.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-chevron-corporation-cvx-130005655.html,Market Sentiment Risk

Let’s delve into XOM’s fundamentals and overall business environment..Per the latest short-term energy outlook of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the West Texas Intermediate Spot Average price for 2025 is projected at $61.81 per barrel, significantly lower than $76.60 per barrel in 2024. EIA further lowers the projections for the commodity’s price for 2026 to $55.24 per barrel. Since analysts are expecting oil supply to grow faster than the demand for it, global oil inventories are rising, putting pressure on crude prices, which could hurt XOM’s upstream operations. .Since ExxonMobil generates the king-size of its earnings from its upstream operations, lower crude prices are likely to hurt its bottom line..Other integrated majors that are also getting the brunt of lower oil prices are Chevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP. This is because both CVX and BP generate significant proportions of their earnings from exploration and production activities of oil and natural gas..Many analysts think that commodity price volatility, especially when crude prices are likely to fall in the days ahead, could limit cash flows of CVX and BP like XOM, and hence require cautious capital allocation..Through its chemicals business, XOM has established itself as a major global player in the petrochemical industry. The integrated energy major manufactures key petrochemicals like olefins and polyolefins, which are essential raw materials used in a wide range of everyday items..However, the global market is facing an oversupply of chemical products, largely due to sluggish demand for petrochemicals being produced by numerous new plants built by other companies apart from ExxonMobil. With oversupply, prices for chemical products are lower, thereby reflecting XOM’s challenging chemical business..Should Investors Bet on XOM Stock?.The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China create uncertainty for ExxonMobil, which could negatively impact its profits and complicate the company’s planning for future projects and expenditures.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobils-valuation-remains-premium-investors-130800237.html,market risk

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is riding record gold prices higher..Aris Mining is a Vancouver, Canada based gold mining company. Founded in Sep 2022, it aims to be a leading Latin America-focused gold mining company. It currently has 2 producing mines, both in Colombia, and 3 projects in Colombia and Guyana..It has a market cap of $1.2 billion, which makes it a ""junior"" gold miner..On May 7, 2025, Aris Mining reported its first quarter 2025 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.02. It reported $0.16 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.18..However, the $0.16 was a new quarterly earnings record for the company since it was formed in Sep 2022..Gold revenue rose 47% year-over-year to $154.1 million from $105.2 million as gold prices rose and production increased. Gold production was up 8% from the prior year..In a June 2025 corporate update, Aris Mining confirmed that its big expansion plans at its two producing mines were moving forward. The company expects to double its gold production by the end of 2026 to >500 koz/yr..It has guided 2025 at a range of 230 to 275 koz/yr..With the price of gold hitting new highs, it's not surprising that the gold miners are seeing good free cash flows..At Segovia in Colombia, which is considered to be one of the world's highest-grade gold mines, Aris Mining had a realized gold price of $2855 an ounce in the first quarter with an AISC of just $1570. That's a difference of $1285..Aris Mining doesn't pay a dividend. It has $240 million in cash on hand as of the end of Q1 2025 but is deploying some of it to pay for the expansion of its two operating mines..Total debt is $486 million, with a leverage of just 1.2x..Gold price is trending higher in Q2 than it did in Q1. That's going to mean higher revenue and earnings, as long as the company can get the gold out of the ground..In the last 30 days, one estimate was revised higher for 2025.

This round of job cuts is part of the oil giant’s broader global restructuring plan, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in headcount, up to 9,000 employees, by the end of 2026. While Chevron initially reported 799 job losses in Midland to the Texas Workforce Commission, the figure was later revised due to a data error. Most of the affected roles are based at Chevron’s Mid-Continent campus on Deauville Boulevard, with additional cuts across nearby operational sites.The company’s rationale is clear: simplify the operating structure, increase execution speed, and maintain long-term competitiveness. As Chevron integrates new technologies and rethinks where and how work gets done, it aims to centralize key functions and expand its global service hubs. For Midland, a critical point in Chevron’s Permian Basin footprint, signals a shift toward leaner on-the-ground operations and heavier reliance on centralized decision-making.Chevron is offering severance and transition assistance, but the scale and cadence of layoffs across California and Texas highlight just how deep its cost-cutting agenda runs. With more cuts expected through 2026, Chevron’s restructuring may redefine how it operates across key U.S. basins..ExxonMobil XOM, Chevron’s primary competitor, has taken a deliberate and methodical path in reshaping its workforce, steering clear of sweeping layoffs seen elsewhere in the industry. Rather than focusing on broad structural cuts, ExxonMobil ties reductions to individual and business performance, with most changes occurring outside the U.S. Over the past two years, ExxonMobil has quietly trimmed headcount while leaning on technology to streamline operations globally.European supermajor Shell SHEL has also been undergoing workforce transformation. After Shell’s new CEO, Wael Sawan, took office, the company has been focusing on creating more value for its shareholders by improving its performance and simplifying its business operations. A central element of Shell’s strategy involves streamlining operations and consolidating management to reduce expenses, with a particular focus on regions where operating costs are higher..Shares of Chevron have lost around 3% year to date..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.From a valuation standpoint, Chevron’s forward 12-month P/E multiple stands at over 18X, well above the subindustry.

But this fairly complicated product can also help investors who prefer to buy individual stocks, which is a function of the screening process used..Targeting well-run companies that have high yields, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's recent rebalancing suggests that energy stocks could be a place for dividend investors to focus on today. Here are three top options from the ETF's portfolio..The 100 stocks within the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF go through a fairly strict screening process. First, only companies that have increased their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years are looked at. (Real estate investment trusts are removed from consideration.) Then a composite score is created for the remaining stocks..The score includes cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and a company's five-year dividend growth rate. The 100 companies with the highest scores are included in the ETF. Without getting too deep into each metric, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is attempting to focus on high-quality businesses that have both growth potential and attractive yields. This is basically what most dividend investors are trying to do when they pick stocks..That makes the ETF's portfolio a great starting point for dividend investors. And right now, after the annual rebalancing of the portfolio, energy stocks appear to be an important focus. This sector makes up 21% of the ETF's assets, which is its largest sector weighting. If you haven't been looking at energy stocks, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity's portfolio suggests you should be. Its top three energy holdings are ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG). Here's a look at each one..ConocoPhillips has a dividend yield of 3.6%. The dividend has been increased annually for eight years. The annualized dividend growth rate over the past five years is an attractive 20%. That said, ConocoPhillips is down around 25% or so over the past 12 months, falling even more than the price of oil. That makes complete sense..ConocoPhillips is a pure-play energy producer. So the top and bottom lines of its income statement are entirely reliant on the price of the commodities it sells. The dividend has a history of being a little on the volatile side, too. And, in fact, it was cut in 2016 during the deep energy downturn at the time. Even if you have a particularly strong stomach and a positive outlook for oil, this is a more aggressive investment option.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-u-dividend-equity-etf-222400702.html,Concentration Risk
115,2025-06-06 19:58:00,Insiders Are Buying Prairie Operating Co. - Should You Too?,"Insider buying and Citi's bullish $8 target put PROP in focus, but dilution and execution risks still loom large.","Prairie Operating Co. PROP has captured investor attention in recent days, driven by a surge in insider buying and a fresh endorsement from Wall Street heavyweight Citi. Over the past two weeks, the company’s top brass — including the CEO and President — collectively acquired more than 175,000 shares. Such moves often indicate confidence in the business and signal a potential inflection point. Adding fuel to the narrative, Citi initiated coverage earlier this week with a Buy rating and an ambitious $8.00 price target, portraying the company as a high-upside opportunity in Colorado’s DJ Basin. It’s worth noting that the stock currently trades below $4, making the upside potential, at least on paper, appear compelling.While these moves reflect growing optimism from both insiders and analysts, the question remains: Should retail investors jump in as well? To assess that, it’s important to take a closer look at the Prairie Operating Co.’s underlying fundamentals..PROP’s $602 million acquisition of Bayswater assets marks a game-changing move. The deal expanded its production footprint to 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) and added 600 drilling locations across 24,000 net acres in Colorado’s DJ Basin — an area known for stability, efficiency and favorable permitting. Major names like Chevron CVX and Civitas Resources CIVI have built strong positions in the region, proving the economic viability of the Niobrara and Codell formations. Prairie’s rural, regulation-light operating zone provides a permitting edge, potentially allowing faster development timelines compared to peers.The company is moving quickly to capitalize. Nine drilled but uncompleted wells at the Opal Coalbank site and an 11-well Rusch Pad program are already in motion. Production from these pads is expected as early as August, which may help validate management’s ambitious guidance. The hedging program is also notable, locking in a significant portion of 2025-2028 production at healthy prices, offering some insulation from commodity swings..Post-acquisition, Prairie Operating Co. is targeting a conservative capital structure. The company plans to reduce debt using proceeds from preferred equity and warrant conversions — an approach that could simplify its balance sheet within 1-2 years. Prairie Operating Co.'s financial metrics are quickly scaling post-acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA for 2025 is forecasted between $350 million and $370 million, a massive leap from the $140 million previously projected. Net income guidance stands between $69 million and $102 million, while the company maintains a low leverage ratio of 1.0X.

PDVSA will finance its portion of investment through crude shipments..The companies involved include Aldyl Argentina, Anhui Guangda Mining Investing and China Concord Resources, according to internal PDVSA documents reviewed by Bloomberg..A US company, North American Blue Energy Partners, affiliated with energy investor Harry Sargeant III’s Global Oil Management Group, signed a deal but reportedly withdrew due to the inability to secure a US operating licence..National Assembly Member of the Energy Committee William Rodríguez told the news agency that: “The only way Venezuela can maintain and increase its production is by relying on private local and international companies that don’t care about US sanctions. Unlike 2019, when sanctions first hit, there is a framework in place to operate outside the US banking system and a structured market with ally countries, including China, Iran and Russia.”.Unlike earlier joint ventures, these 20-year contracts do not require approval from Venezuela’s National Assembly..They are authorised under President Maduro’s anti-blockade law, which bypasses traditional legislative processes and restrictions on foreign participation in the oil sector.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-signs-nine-oil-deals-092911054.html,Sovereign Risk
117,2025-06-06 17:00:00,1 Top High-Yielding Warren Buffett Dividend Stock You Shouldn't Hesitate to Buy Right Now,"Berkshire's sizeable stake in Chevron generates a lot of dividend income.  Chevron can easily afford to pay its big-time dividend.  Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), is stingy when it comes to paying dividends.","Berkshire's sizeable stake in Chevron generates a lot of dividend income..Chevron can easily afford to pay its big-time dividend..The oil giant should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout in the future..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), is stingy when it comes to paying dividends. However, Buffett and his team seem to love collecting dividend income. They've loaded Berkshire's portfolio with many top dividend-paying stocks. .Oil giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one of Berkshire's top holdings. A big draw is its high-yielding dividend, recently around 5%, putting it several times higher than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) sub-1.5% dividend yield). Here's why you shouldn't hesitate to buy the top oil dividend stock right now..Chevron currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share ($6.84 annualized) after increasing its payment by 5% earlier this year. At that rate, Warren Buffett's company collects over $800 million in dividend income from Chevron each year (Berkshire owns 118.6 million shares, or 6.8% of Chevron's outstanding shares). .The oil giant can easily afford to pay Buffett's company and its other investors. Chevron produced $31.5 billion in cash flow from operations last year and $15 billion in free cash flow after funding the capital expenses needed to maintain and grow its production. That covered its $11.8 billion dividend outlay with ample room to spare. .Chevron has so much financial flexibility due to its fortress balance sheet that it opted to return a record $27 billion in cash to shareholders last year via dividends and share repurchases. Even with that massive cash return, Chevron's leverage ratio ended last year at 10.4%, well below its 20%-25% target range. .Chevron's dividend increase earlier this year extended its growth streak to 38 straight years. That includes multiple commodity price cycles, showcasing the resilience of the company's dividend. Further, Chevron hasn't just been nudging up its dividend payment each year to keep its streak alive. It has delivered peer-leading dividend growth over the last 10 years. .The oil company shouldn't have any trouble continuing to increase its dividend. One factor fueling that view is its ultra-low-cost resource base. Chevron has built a very resilient oil and gas resource portfolio, with a peer-leading break-even level of around $30 per barrel this year. With crude prices currently in the mid-$60s, Chevron has a huge cushion. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-high-yielding-warren-090000869.html,No risk

That is because the June 20, 2025 $80 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today..Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy..Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Chevron shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Chevron is a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated – International industry that ranks in the Bottom 5% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.79 per share to $1.58 in that period..Given the way analysts feel about Chevron right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected..Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

120,2025-06-04 23:28:00,Is ExxonMobil's Plan for $35 Oil Breakeven Going to be a Game Changer?,"XOM aims to cut its oil breakeven to $35 by 2027 and $30 by 2030, boosting resilience even in low-price markets.","Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM mentioned in its recent earnings call that it plans to lower its breakeven costs to $35 per barrel by 2027 and $30 per barrel by 2030. Now, the billion-dollar question lies with the investors: To what extent will this lower breakeven, if achieved, aid XOM?.This is a realistic question that should arise in every investor’s mind since the integrated energy giant derives the lion's share of its earnings from its upstream business. The no-brainer answer is that this level of low breakeven costs will be highly beneficial for XOM’s bottom line, especially from its upstream business. In other words, ExxonMobil will remain profitable even if crude oil prices drop significantly and stand to earn substantially more when prices climb..To add to that, even during most months of 2020, when energy demand collapsed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ExxonMobil’s upstream operations could have been profitable if its breakeven costs had been $30 per barrel. Per data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Cushing, OK, WTI Spot prices for March, April and May were only below the $30 per barrel mark. Thus, there is no doubt that this development, if achieved, is going to be a game changer for ExxonMobil..According to Statista, a leading platform for data collection and visualization, the breakeven price in the Permian, especially in the Delaware and Midland sub-basins, is well below $40 per barrel. Hence, companies operating in the Permian, like Chevron Corporation CVX and EOG Resources Inc. EOG, are experiencing low breakeven prices..In 2024, CVX conducted 80% of its development activities in the Delaware basin. Chevron plans to increase the development program in the Delaware basin to 85% this year. This simplifies CVX’s strong focus on low breakeven-cost operations to maximize its profit..In its recent earnings call, EOG said that it could easily handle all its planned spending for this year, even if oil prices trade in the low $50 per barrel. That means that to remain financially healthy, EOG does not need high oil prices..Shares of ExxonMobil have declined 4.4% over the past year, outpacing the 6.3% fall of the composite stocks belonging to the industry.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .From a valuation standpoint, XOM trades at a trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) of 6.45x.

121,2025-06-04 20:50:00,Will Chevron's Dividend Growth Outlook Weaken Amid Headwinds?,"CVX's dividend remains reliable, but reinvestment needs and lost cash flow may slow down its payout growth in the near term.","Chevron Corporation CVX has long been a reliable dividend stock in the energy sector, offering stability in a typically volatile space. With a current yield around 5% and a five-year dividend growth rate of about 6%, its payouts remain appealing. However, there are signs that future dividend growth may slow down — not because the dividend is at risk, but due to shifting financial priorities.One reason is the loss of high-margin oil production from Venezuela, which used to provide extra free cash flow. While not critical to operations, its absence reduces Chevron’s financial flexibility. At the same time, the company’s increasing focus on short-cycle shale production, particularly in the Permian Basin, demands ongoing reinvestment. Unlike long-term deepwater projects, shale requires constant drilling to sustain output, creating a trade-off between funding growth and raising dividends.Projects like the Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan could ease this pressure by 2026, giving Chevron more room to increase payouts. But until then, if oil stays around $60-$65, the company may prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet and investing in production over aggressively increasing dividends..ExxonMobil XOM, Chevron’s main competitor, offers a slightly lower dividend yield but has shown stronger coverage in recent quarters. Its focus on long-term projects like Guyana and LNG, which require less frequent reinvestment once operational, gives ExxonMobil more room to support future dividend increases.Shell SHEL, meanwhile, took a different path — cutting its dividend significantly in 2020. The European supermajor was forced to slash its quarterly dividend by two-thirds to weather the COVID-induced oil price crash and preserve cash. Since then, Shell has been cautiously rebuilding payouts while also investing heavily in its energy transition strategy.Against this backdrop, Chevron remains a dependable dividend payer, but it may start losing its appeal compared to ExxonMobil’s more stable returns, while Shell is not one of the Dividend Aristocrats known for steady payout growth though it boasts of an impressive record..Shares of Chevron have lost around 4% year to date..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.From a valuation standpoint, Chevron’s forward 12-month P/E multiple stands at over 18X, well above the subindustry.

As representatives, Dow companies tend to be reliable, industry-leading businesses -- making the Dow a good place to look for blue chip stocks..Here's why Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) stand out as top Dow stocks to buy now..Scott Levine (Chevron): With the midpoint of 2025 nearly upon us, it's a great time to look back on how things have fared so far and to take action if necessary. For those eager to start a new position, Chevron is a strong consideration right now. While the stock's performance this year has been unfavorable, it should certainly not dissuade patient investors with long investing horizons. Of course, the stock's 5% forward dividend yield doesn't hurt either..An oil supermajor, Chevron has robust operations throughout the energy value chain. This, in part, helps the company weather downturns in energy prices -- something that savvy investors know well. For example, while the price of oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate has dropped nearly 12% since the start of the year, shares of Chevron have only dipped 3.5% lower at the time of this writing..Furthermore, with energy prices lower, management has taken steps to ensure that the company's financial position remains strong. In addition to a $2 billion reduction in capital expenditures from 2024, management aims to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2026..Illustrating further the company's resilience during downturns in energy prices, Chevron has consistently hiked its dividend higher for 38 consecutive years -- a period that has certainly seen its share of plunging oil prices.

The company reported that the Texas layoffs would include 185 people at the Deauville Boulevard site, 14 people at North FM 1788 and seven more at the South County Road site..Chevron previously announced that these job cuts would take place across its global workforce and could affect almost 6,750-9,000 employees. The recent round of layoffs in Texas is slated to take place on July 15, 2025. CVX’s latest annual report mentions that it currently employs around 40,200 non-service station employees and 5,400 employees who work at service stations..The U.S. energy major plans to trim its workforce by 15-20% to streamline operations, execute broader plans faster and make decision-making more efficient. Furthermore, this should not only help the company reduce costs but also enhance its competitiveness in the long run..Chevron recently faced business headwinds for several reasons. The company had to terminate its operations in Venezuela, including production and procurement contracts, after President Donald Trump revoked an important license crucial to operations in the region. Following this, Chevron has handed over the governance of the joint venture to its partner, the state-owned company, PDVSA..CVX’s $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corp. and its highly productive assets in Guyana also faces uncertainty over arbitration disputes filed by ExxonMobil and China’s CNOOC.

For a company known for its scale, dividend reliability and global footprint, this sharp underperformance has left many investors wondering what’s gone wrong and whether it’s time to re-evaluate the stock’s near-term investment appeal..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.In this article, we break down the mounting challenges that explain Chevron’s recent slide. From geopolitical setbacks in Venezuela to legal wrangling over its Hess Corporation HES acquisition and earnings underperformance, the energy giant is facing pressure on multiple fronts. Let’s examine why the stock’s recent decline may not be a buying opportunity, but a warning sign..One major factor behind Chevron’s declining fundamentals is the abrupt halt to its Venezuelan operations. Following the expiration of its U.S. license on May 27, 2025, the company is now barred from exporting oil or generating revenue from its joint ventures in the country, operations that previously produced around 150,000 barrels per day of hydrocarbons. At $60 oil, that’s a hit worth roughly $3 billion annually.These weren’t just large volumes of oil — they were low-cost, high-margin barrels that didn’t need much reinvestment. Losing them takes away a key source of steady cash flow for Chevron, right when oil prices are shaky and margins are under pressure. Replacing that with more expensive U.S. shale isn’t easy, since those wells need ongoing spending just to keep production steady..Chevron’s proposed $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation (HES) was intended to offset some of that lost volume — but the deal has only deepened investor uncertainty. First, there’s dilution: the stock-and-share deal will increase Chevron’s share count by up to 20%, putting immediate pressure on earnings per share. That’s already a concern in a weak-margin environment.Second, and perhaps more damaging, is the legal dispute now underway. ExxonMobil has challenged the deal, arguing that it has the right of first refusal on Hess’s 30% stake in the lucrative Stabroek block offshore Guyana. The outcome, expected in Q3 2025, could determine whether Chevron can move forward with the acquisition at all. A ruling against Chevron would gut the deal’s strategic rationale and could lead to an abrupt loss of long-term growth assumptions already priced into the stock.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-down-16-6-months-120000992.html,Company-Specific Risk Financial Performance Risk Geopolitical Risk Regulatory Risk

It also imposed secondary tariffs on Venezuela's oil buyers..Analysts estimate these actions could reduce the OPEC member's oil income, which was around $15 billion in 2024, by approximately 30%..This anticipated revenue loss has led the government to demand advance tax payments, conduct more audits, levy significant fines, and permit local authorities and public service providers to raise their fees, said a dozen businesspeople. These measures add pressure to a private sector grappling with years of economic crisis, high inflation, and currency controls..Neither the communications ministry, finance ministry nor tax agency responded to requests for comment..President Nicolas Maduro, who in April decreed an economic emergency that allows him to erase tax exemptions, had already asked officials in January to double tax income from $5.2 billion last year.

About 60% of those surveyed plan little to no increase in production in the coming months..""Whatever additional tax is paid will come from the working capital,"" said Luigi Pisella, president of Conindustria.

But if you pay close attention, you...","Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has had a rough three months with its share price down 10%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Chevron's  ROE in this article..Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..The formula for return on equity is:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chevron is:.10% = US$16b ÷ US$150b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025)..The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.. Check out our latest analysis for Chevron .We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes..When you first look at it, Chevron's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Moreover, we are quite pleased to see that Chevron's net income grew significantly at a rate of 32% over the last five years. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place..We then performed a comparison between Chevron's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 37% in the same 5-year period.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-corporation-nyse-cvx-stocks-110033759.html,Market Risk

Warren Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, have never paid a dividend, primarily because Buffett has always believed that he could deploy capital in a more rewarding manner for shareholders.","Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway owns several stocks with strong dividends..Dividend stocks can be nice to own because they often provide reliable, passive income, even during volatile markets..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.Warren Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, have never paid a dividend, primarily because Buffett has always believed that he could deploy capital in a more rewarding manner for shareholders. Over six decades, the Oracle of Omaha has proven that thesis. But that doesn't mean Buffett and his team of investors don't like investing in stocks that pay dividends. After all, what's better than knowing that every year, your investments will generate passive income even if their stock doesn't always perform as well as expected? This year, Buffett and Berkshire will collect over $1.3 billion in passive income from their investments in these two stocks..Buffett and Berkshire have shown a keen interest in U.S. domestic oil and energy producers in recent years, and even though the price of oil per barrel has remained subdued, Buffett clearly believes that oil and gas will continue to be in demand and that prices will eventually rise. This thesis has led Berkshire to purchase over 118.6 million shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which consumed slightly under 6% of Berkshire's portfolio at the end of the first quarter of the year. That also makes Chevron Berkshire's fifth largest equity holding..Chevron has paid a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share for the first two quarters of the year and currently pays a roughly 5% dividend yield. Assuming this continues, and assuming Berkshire holds its stake in the company constant, Berkshire will collect close to $811.3 million in dividends from Chevron this year..The Houston, Texas-based company has a good dividend track record. Chevron increased its quarterly dividend this year by 5%, marking the 38th consecutive year the company has increased its annual dividend. Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2025 came in lower than normal at $1.3 billion, but excluding working capital, which can be volatile for the company quarter to quarter, free cash flow was $3.7 billion, enough to cover the $3 billion in dividends paid in the quarter..Furthermore, management on the company's first-quarter earnings call said that growth projects underway are expected to generate an additional $10 billion of free cash flow in 2026, assuming oil is at $70 per barrel. Management also said their top priority is growing the dividend, so if oil prices were to plummet and management had to pull back on capital returns, they would decrease share buybacks before the dividend.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-over-1-33-221400526.html,no risk

Among the myriad of options, dividend investing stands out for those in search of passive income..Research by Hartford Funds (a division of Hartford Financial Services), in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, reveals a compelling narrative: Dividend-paying companies have historically outperformed their counterparts that don't pay dividends. Over a 50-year period, investors in dividend stocks enjoyed an annual return of about 9.2%, more than double the 4.3% return from non dividend payers..Dividend-paying companies tend to have steady cash flows, strong capital management, and a deep-rooted commitment to rewarding their shareholders. If you're looking for passive dividend income, here are three companies that offer payouts well above the S&P 500's current yield of just 1.24%..Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is a leading utility, serving over 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia and the Carolinas. In recent years, Dominion has undergone a transformation, streamlining its business by divesting from pipelines and natural gas utilities..It is strengthening its balance sheet and aligning its payout ratio with its peers. With a stable and predictable cash flow, the utility should easily support its attractive 4.7% yielding dividend..Its focus on regulated electric-utility service in high-growth regions makes it a pure-play electricity provider with excellent upside. Its presence in Northern Virginia is significant, given its role in supplying energy to ""Data Center Alley,"" one of the largest concentrations of data centers in the world..Last year, the company said it had received requests from data centers to provide several gigawatts of electricity.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Chevron (CVX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this oil company have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, which Chevron falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Chevron is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -15.8%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.85 points to a change of -31.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -10.4%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.74 indicates a change of +27.7% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -16.5%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chevron is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-corporation-cvx-attracting-investor-130014144.html,no risk

A falling share price pushes a yield up, and as long as the business' fundamentals are strong, you can benefit both from its recurring dividend payments and a possible rally in its share price in the future..Three stocks that yield more than 4% and that are near their lows for the past year are PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), General Mills (NYSE: GIS), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They are all off to poor starts for 2025, but here's why you may want to consider investing $5,000 into them today..Snacking and beverage giant PepsiCo hasn't been a hot buy with investors this year; it has fallen by 15%. While its growth rate hasn't been impressive, investors may be a bit overly bearish on the stock. .In its most recent quarter, which wrapped up on March 22, the company's sales totaled $17.9 billion, representing a decline of 1.8% year over year. And PepsiCo's operating profit fell by 4.9%. That's not a great performance, but it's not disastrous, and it comes at a time when consumers are tightening their budgets amid inflation and concerns about a possible recession on the horizon. .PepsiCo isn't standing still, either. The business is continuing to expand, and earlier this year, it announced a $2 billion acquisition of soda company Poppi, a prebiotic brand that caters to health-conscious consumers. It's a good way to diversify and reach a different type of customer, which may help improve its growth rate in the process..PepsiCo's dividend, which currently yields 4.4%, well above the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) average of 1.3%, is still safe with a payout ratio of around 80%. Ideally it would be lower, but it doesn't look to be at any risk right now of being cut. This is also a Dividend King, so the outlook would need to be particularly dire for PepsiCo's management to break its impressive streak of dividend increases, which will hit 53 years with its upcoming June payment..The stock currently trades just a few dollars from its 52-week low, and at a modest price-to-earnings multiple of 19, PepsiCo can be an underrated buy and a great place to invest $5,000. Not only can you generate approximately $220 in annual dividend income from the stock via its dividend by investing that much, but you can also net a decent return if it's able to recover from its decline this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-5-000-3-high-080700083.html,Company Specific Risk

In a separate notice filed in March, Chevron also revealed plans to lay off at least 600 employees in California, effective June 1..Chevron has faced increasing pressure in recent months..In March, U.S. President Donald Trump’s government revoked its license to operate in Venezuela. Chevron cannot operate oilfields in the country or export its oil, with the aim of avoiding sending any payments to President Nicolas Maduro’s administration. Chevron had previously been exporting up to 290,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil before the sanction—equivalent to around a third of the country’s total..On top of that, there’s ongoing uncertainty surrounding its proposed $53 billion acquisition of Hess (HES), an oil company based in New York. Though Hess shareholders and the Federal Trade Commission finally approved the deal, it’s not all the way done due to an arbitration dispute with Chevron’s competitor, ExxonMobil (XOM)..The latter’s Stabroek Block, a giant oil discovery off the coast of Guyana, is tied up in arbitration proceedings because Exxon thinks it has a right to take back Hess’s 30% stake in the event the company sold itself. Chevron disputes this..On top of this, Chevron filed a change-of-address form last August, moving its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston, Texas. The relocation is connected to a lawsuit from the oil giant’s longtime home state alleging that it misled the public for decades about its connection to climate change, The New York Times (NYT) reports..For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-lay-off-800-workers-143400455.html,Operational Risk

The company has been growing via acquisitions, an approach that is likely to continue.  A lot has changed about Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) since around 2020.","Occidental Petroleum is a large oil and natural gas company..The company has been growing via acquisitions, an approach that is likely to continue..The company is likely to grow more quickly than some of its largest peers, but it is also likely to be more volatile..10 stocks we like better than Occidental Petroleum ›.A lot has changed about Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) since around 2020. Some of the changes were good and some weren't, though how you view the company may depend a little bit on your approach to investing..Occidental Petroleum has some very well-known supporters, but does that make it a buy while the shares trade below $45?.Occidental Petroleum, which is usually just shortened to Oxy, is a large business, with a market cap of around $40 billion. However, large is a relative term, as that valuation is relatively small compared to the largest players in the energy sector. For instance, industry giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) has a market cap of around $440 billion..This difference actually plays an important role in whether or not you might want to buy Oxy stock today. That's because ExxonMobil is one of the largest integrated energy companies on the planet. And Oxy is basically trying to grow to a point where it can compete with companies like ExxonMobil. The primary route that Oxy has used to grow its business of late has been acquisitions..The process started to ramp up in 2019 when Oxy bought Anadarko Petroleum. With the financial support of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) it managed to steal Anadarko away from Chevron (NYSE: CVX). But the deal led to a sea change for Oxy because it leaned heavily on debt to get the Anadarko deal done. When oil prices plunged during the coronavirus pandemic, it was forced to cut its dividend and refocus its financials around debt reduction..To Oxy's credit, it has dramatically improved its financial situation concerning its balance sheet. Its debt-to-equity ratio rose to nearly 2x following the Anadarko deal but is now down to around 0.7x. And it has inked two more acquisitions since it completed the Anadarko acquisition, so it has been much more prudent about its purchases. That's a good thing..But the dividend remains well below where it was prior to the dividend cut. What's interesting is that the dividend yield remains notably lower, as well. This is basically a function of the market recognizing that Oxy is taking a different approach with its business. It is now more focused on growth. That's not a bad thing, but it is very different from what you will get from industry giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron. These two integrated energy companies lean more toward reliable dividends despite operating in a volatile industry.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-occidental-petroleum-while-trading-081000744.html,Strategic Risk

She added that “OPEC members’ failure to comply with production quotas and Trump’s trade policies negatively impact global oil demand.”.Additional support for prices came after Trump suggested earlier this week that new sanctions on Russia were under consideration..Gold prices steadied on Wednesday as dip buyers re-entered the market, though broader gains were tempered by improving US-EU trade relations.

The best time to buy an integrated energy giant, meanwhile, is usually when oil prices are weak. That's the case today, and two brilliant high-yield oil stocks to consider buying now are Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE). Here's why..There are three broad segments to the overall energy industry. Upstream companies drill for oil and natural gas, which means their top and bottom lines tend to be as volatile as oil and gas prices. The midstream helps to move oil and gas through infrastructure assets like pipelines. Midstream companies tend to produce reliable revenues from a toll-taker model, but they also tend to be slow-growing. And the downstream is made up of chemical and refining companies, where both the inputs and the outputs involve volatilely priced commodities. Each segment is obviously a bit different..While investors could invest in just one segment of the energy industry, including them all in one ""integrated"" company can help soften the inherent ups and downs of the energy sector. Adding to the diversification of large integrated energy companies is the fact that they usually have business ventures in multiple geographic regions. This allows the companies to invest where returns will be most attractive. If you want to put some long-term money into the energy sector, integrated energy companies should be high up on your list of choices..There are a handful of independent integrated energy giants. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron hail from the U.S. market. Shell (NYSE: SHEL), BP (NYSE: BP), and TotalEnergies come from Europe. Out of this group, Chevron and TotalEnergies stand out thanks to their high dividend yields and strong business fundamentals..Chevron, for example, offers a dividend yield of 5%. That's well above ExxonMobil's 3.8% and the energy industry average of around 3.6%. Chevron faces a few headwinds right now, including a contentious acquisition that has yet to close and the fact that it operates in politically unstable Venezuela. But the problems it faces today are likely to be transitory, so long-term dividend investors shouldn't get too worked up about them.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-brilliant-high-yield-oil-075500222.html,Commodity Price Risk Transition Risk

The high-volume, low-cost development offshore the South American country, which started production just five years ago, is already pumping more than 660,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude. Exxon is the operator of the block with a 45% stake. Hess holds 30%, and CNOOC has the remaining 25% stake..The Dispute.But in 2023, Chevron proposed a $53-billion deal to buy Hess Corp and thus take Hess’s assets in the Bakken in North Dakota and the 30% stake in Guyana’s offshore oil field—a top-performing asset with the potential to yield even more barrels and billions of U.S. dollars for the project’s partners..Production capacity in Guyana is expected to surpass 1.7 million barrels per day, with gross production growing to 1.3 million barrels per day by 2030, Exxon says. Guyana is now the third-largest per-capita oil producer in the world, according to the U.S. supermajor. .Proceeds for the consortium are also rising with growing production, even at current oil prices, because the Guyana Stabroek block is estimated to have a breakeven oil price of about $30 per barrel..Chevron’s bid to buy Hess’s stake in the Guyana projects is being challenged by Exxon and CNOOC, who claim they have a right of first refusal for Hess’s stake under the terms of a joint operating agreement (JOA) for the Stabroek block. Hess and Chevron claim the JOA doesn’t apply to a case of a proposed full corporate merger..And so, the dispute went to arbitration, and the once amicable relationship between Exxon and Chevron’s top executives has vanished, sources tell The Wall Street Journal..The arbitration initiated by Exxon and CNOOC has delayed the closing of Chevron’s bid to buy Hess by more than 18 months. There is a very good chance that the matter will be resolved – either in favor of Chevron or Exxon – by the end of the year. The three-judge arbitration panel began hearings on Monday behind closed doors. The panel is expected to rule within 90 days from the end of the hearings, so the fate of Chevron’s $53-billion acquisition of Hess could be clear by August or September this year..The Prize.While Chevron’s deal to buy Hess has stalled, ExxonMobil finalized the $60-billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which boosted Exxon’s presence in the Permian.

163,2025-05-26 20:17:00,Who Will Win Guyana's Oil? Chevron and ExxonMobil Face Off,"XOM and CVX battle in arbitration over Hess' stake in Guyana's oil-rich Stabroek Block, with 11B barrels and industry influence on the line.","A high-stakes corporate clash is unfolding between Chevron CVX and ExxonMobil XOM — two of the world’s largest oil companies. At the heart of the dispute is Guyana’s offshore Stabroek Block, a massive oil field with over 11 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. Chevron’s planned $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation HES, which owns a 30% stake in the block, is now facing fierce resistance from ExxonMobil, the project’s operator and 45% stakeholder. ExxonMobil, along with its Chinese partner CNOOC (25% stake), claims it has a contractual right of first refusal (ROFR) that would allow it to either block or match Chevron’s bid.Chevron and Hess argue that the clause doesn’t apply in this case. They maintain the ROFR is triggered only in direct asset sales, not in full corporate mergers like theirs. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, contends that because Hess’s value is overwhelmingly tied to its Guyana interest — reportedly around 70% — the distinction between an asset and entity sale is largely irrelevant. With both sides unwilling to back down, the issue has landed in arbitration under the International Chamber of Commerce. The confidential hearing is set to begin today, with a final ruling expected by the end of the third quarter..For Chevron, the stakes are enormous. Its oil and gas reserves fell to 9.8 billion barrels at the end of 2024, the lowest level in over a decade. Adding Hess’s Guyana stake is seen as vital to reversing that trend and improving its reserve replacement ratio. A win in arbitration would give Chevron access to one of the few remaining high-growth, low-cost basins, helping to secure its long-term production outlook. A loss, however, would leave it scrambling for another transformative acquisition at a time when large-scale opportunities are limited.The transaction has already been approved by Chevron’s shareholders and cleared by U.S. regulators, but its fate now rests on the tribunal’s interpretation of a joint operating agreement drafted more than a decade ago. In anticipation of a positive outcome, Chevron has bought roughly 5% of Hess’s outstanding shares in the open market. Traders and hedge funds are also heavily invested, with more than $10 billion worth of Hess stock purchased by merger-arbitrage funds betting on a favorable ruling..ExxonMobil views Hess’ exit to Chevron as a disruption of a long-standing partnership and a threat to its control of the Guyana project. Exxon CEO Darren Woods has defended the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s position, arguing that it took early development risks when few others would and that its rights under the operating agreement must be upheld. Behind the legal battle lies a strategic concern. Letting Chevron in could weaken Exxon’s influence in what is quickly becoming the most important oil basin in the Western Hemisphere.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/win-guyanas-oil-chevron-exxonmobil-121700130.html,Legal Risk   Operational Risk   Market Risk
164,2025-05-26 18:35:00,Chevron May Receive Limited Maintenance License for Venezuela,CVX is set to receive a minimal license for safety-only work in Venezuela as U.S. policy shifts back to stricter Trump-era sanctions.,"Chevron Corporation CVX is expected to be granted a limited license from the U.S. Treasury Department for limited operations in Venezuela. This special waiver may authorize the oil giant to conduct only critical maintenance and safety-related functions within the sanctions-bound South American country. The license comes as Chevron and other firms in America face looming deadlines to wind down their operations in the region..The decision to restrict Chevron’s operations is a marked departure from the broader authorization previously extended under President Biden. That waiver, issued in late 2022, allowed Chevron to not only maintain operations but also produce and sell Venezuela’s crude oil, a move designed to re-engage the Nicolás Maduro regime in democratic negotiations. However, this policy was revoked in February by President Trump, citing the failure of Venezuela to commit to democratic reforms and condemning what he referred to as concessions to a dictatorship..The new license, in contrast, is highly restrictive, signaling a return to Trump-era policies that favor isolation and pressure over engagement. The scope of the waiver is expected to resemble Chevron’s earlier license that expired in November 2022, strictly prohibiting new investments or crude exports while allowing minimal upkeep to ensure the safety of existing infrastructure..Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the current license for Chevron is set to expire on May 27 and the U.S. government will not renew it in the current form. The decision undercuts previous expectations of a 60-day extension, which had been hinted at by Ric Grenell, President Trump’s special envoy, following his diplomatic visit to Caracas..The sudden policy shift has cast uncertainty over Chevron’s long-term presence in Venezuela, an OPEC nation with the world’s largest proven oil reserves. While the exact terms of the new waiver remain undisclosed, sources indicate that only essential operations critical for safety and environmental protection will be permitted. This limits Chevron’s activity to basic maintenance, such as preventing spills or leaks and preserving the integrity of facilities..The limited license could serve as a strategic compromise, offering a middle ground that allows the United States to maintain some influence in Venezuela without appearing to support the Maduro regime. This restrained approach may also leave open the possibility for future diplomatic negotiations, though the Trump administration has clearly emphasized a harder line.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-may-receive-limited-maintenance-103500945.html,Regulatory Risk   Operational Risk   Country Risk

Western Midstream Partners pays a monster cash distribution.  The recent drop in Chevron's stock price is a solid buy opportunity.,"Buy Dominion Energy for the 4.8% yield; keep it for the unfolding turnaround..Western Midstream Partners pays a monster cash distribution..The recent drop in Chevron's stock price is a solid buy opportunity..10 stocks we like better than Dominion Energy ›.Buying dividend stocks is one of many ways to generate passive income. Many companies offer attractive yields that are much higher than the S&P 500's average, which is currently below 1.5%..Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), Western Midstream Partners (NYSE: WES), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their higher dividend yields. Here's why they believe these stocks are great options for those seeking ways to boost their passive income..Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): Some turnarounds are very risky, with companies working back from the brink of financial disaster. Then there are the turnarounds like the one Dominion Energy is undertaking. Dominion is basically a well-run utility that got over its skis because of an overly complicated business model..It has been slimming down by selling assets such as pipelines and natural gas utilities. Now it is largely just a regulated electric utility operating in attractive regions. That makes the 4.8% yield on offer fairly attractive, noting that the average utility yields only around 2.9%..Investors can buy for the yield, with management stating clearly that the dividend is safe at current levels as the turnaround progresses. What the dividend isn't doing, however, is growing. That will be a problem for some income-focused investors and really highlights the current turnaround effort..Dominion is currently working on strengthening its financial position and trimming its payout ratio so that it's more in line with industry peers. Essentially, the heavy lifting here is on the balance sheet. Progress is being made, but it will probably take at least another few years before dividends are reliably growing again because the payout ratio remains elevated. But with earnings projected to grow between 5% and 7% a year, that, too, will change for the better in time..A payout ratio below 70% will likely be a major dividend turning point. Meanwhile, while you wait for dividend growth to resume, you get to collect that well-above-average yield, which seems like a reasonable trade-off..Matt DiLallo (Western Midstream Partners): Western Midstream Partners is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns and operates midstream assets that gather, process, and transport oil and natural gas for energy companies, including its parent company, Occidental Petroleum. Most of its assets generate stable fee-based cash flows, which support a cash distribution that yields nearly 9.5%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-dividend-stocks-220700760.html,Investment risk

With 71% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company..As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$9.7b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 9.5% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Chevron which might hurt individual investors..Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Chevron.. Check out our latest analysis for Chevron .Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing..We can see that Chevron does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Chevron's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters..Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Chevron. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.0% of the company stock.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-corporations-nyse-cvx-recent-140009339.html,Market Risk Liquidity Risk

169,2025-05-25 06:05:00,Investing in Dividend Stocks: The Stability of Warren Buffett's Picks,Dividend stocks are a central aspect of Buffett's success at Berkshire Hathaway.,"Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay dividends, but Buffett loves investing in companies that do..Buffett gravitates toward consumer-facing brands and core economic industries, like financial services and energy..Berkshire owns several blue chip dividend stocks that can benefit your portfolio if you buy and hold them..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Legendary investor and multibillionaire Warren Buffett has spent six decades leading Berkshire Hathaway. The company hasn't paid a dividend to shareholders for almost its entire existence, but don't let that trick you into believing that Buffett doesn't like dividend stocks..In reality, Buffett loves receiving dividends -- just not paying them..If you look at Berkshire Hathaway's $280 billion-plus stock portfolio, the top eight holdings represent about 75% of the portfolio -- they all pay dividends. A company that pays a growing dividend is typically healthy and profitably growing, which is music to the ears of long-term investors like Buffett. Dividends also represent firm returns, cash in hand, without needing to sell any shares..Here are his five top dividend picks, ranked by their position size in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, and how they can bring stability to your portfolio..The iPhone revolutionized the technology sector and made Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) one of the world's largest companies. Berkshire Hathaway didn't invest in Apple until roughly a decade after the first iPhone launched, but it's still been one of Buffett's best picks. It's still Berkshire's largest holding despite Buffett trimming much of his stake last year for a hefty profit..There are over 2.35 billion active iOS devices worldwide. Apple's user base is a massive distribution network for subscription services, consistently generating huge revenue streams as people upgrade old devices. Apple reinitiated its dividend in 2012 and has raised it every year since. Buffett has referred to Apple as Berkshire's best stock and quipped that people would rather give up their second vehicle than their iPhones..U.S. consumers love credit cards, which has made American Express (NYSE: AXP) a lucrative investment for Berkshire. Berkshire has owned it since Buffett bought the stock in 1991. Credit cards represent easily accessible capital, and American Express has built its brand around businesses and high earners..The company is a lender and, therefore, sensitive to the economy. It has opted against dividend increases during tough times to protect its business and has only cut the dividend once in the late 1990s. However, American Express' dividend generally grows over time and is one of Buffett's longest-standing investments.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-dividend-stocks-stability-warren-220500215.html,low risk

Verizon has the longest dividend growth streak in the U.S. telecom sector.,"Chevron has hiked its dividends for 38 straight years..Johnson & Johnson recently raised its dividend for the 63rd year in a row..Verizon has the longest dividend growth streak in the U.S. telecom sector..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an iconic stock market index. It tracks the performance of 30 of the country's most prominent publicly traded companies. Its components do get changed over time as new leaders rise and old ones fade, but as a rule, those that earn and keep a place in the Dow are some of the bluest of blue chip stocks. .Most of these companies pay dividends. Some of these payouts are currently very attractive if you want to generate passive income. Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) stand out as the top Dow stocks to buy for income in 2025 and beyond. .At its current share price, the dividend that Chevron pays now yields just over 5%. That's more than double the average yield of a Dow component, which was recently right below 2%. .The oil giant has an excellent track record on dividends: It has raised its payments for 38 straight years, a time frame that included multiple commodity cycles. Moreover, Chevron didn't just provide modest increases to keep its streak alive; it has delivered peer-leading dividend growth over the past decade. .Chevron should have no trouble continuing to grow its high-yielding dividend in the future. The company has the most resilient portfolio in the sector, with an industry-leading breakeven level of around $30 per barrel. It also has a strong balance sheet. Its leverage ratio is currently at 14%, which is below its 20% to 25% target range and at the low end of its peer group. Chevron management says it expects to boost its free cash flow by $9 billion by next year assuming oil averages $60 a barrel (around the current level) as it completes several growth projects. All of these factors suggest the company will have plenty of fuel to continue growing its dividend. .Johnson & Johnson's dividend at its current share price yields around 3.4%. The healthcare giant recently hiked its payout by nearly 5%, extending its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That kept the company in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. .Johnson & Johnson has one of the healthiest financial profiles in the world. It's one of just two companies with an AAA bond rating, which is higher than the U.S. government. It ended the first quarter with a mere $13.5 billion of net debt ($38.8 billion of cash and $52.3 billion of debt) -- a pittance for a healthcare behemoth with a $370 billion market cap.

It is key to Chevron CEO Mike Wirth's strategy of improving the oil company's performance. Exxon and China's CNOOC, Hess' partners in Guyana, filed arbitration disputes early last year, which have delayed the deal's closing and caused Chevron to miss out on increased output and revenue..Hess' most attractive asset is its 30% stake in the Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana, operated by Exxon.

173,2025-05-23 20:17:00,Chevron vs. Petrobras: Is Either Oil Giant Worth Holding Onto Now?,"CVX and PBR face falling cash flow, rising debt and earnings pressure. Both stocks are now rated Strong Sell amid mounting macro and company-specific risks.","Chevron Corporation CVX and Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., better known as Petrobras PBR, are two heavyweights in the global Oil/Energy sector. Both operate across exploration, production and refining, and both offer substantial dividend payouts. While Chevron dominates U.S. upstream operations and maintains a steady global footprint, Petrobras is Brazil’s energy giant with unmatched access to pre-salt offshore reserves and aggressive state-supported investment strategies. Their scale, capital allocation approaches and dividend yields have made them popular among income-focused investors.Yet, macro challenges, commodity price volatility and company-specific risks are narrowing the gap between these two. Investors looking for stability and growth in energy stocks must now consider whether either of these names is a solid long-term play, or if both are better left on the sidelines. Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine why it’s best to get rid of both stocks now..Chevron has shown resilience through volatile markets, but cracks are forming. In the first quarter of 2025, cash flow from operations was $5.2 billion, down 23.5% year over year. The culprit was lower oil price realizations and tax payments associated with divestment in Canada. U.S. liquids averaged $55.26 per barrel during the first quarter, down nearly 4% from the year-earlier level. Even with natural gas strength, total revenues of $47.6 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and earnings slipped to $3.5 billion from $5.5 billion.A core issue lies in Chevron’s shrinking flexibility. The company issued $5.5 billion in new debt to fund dividends and buybacks, pushing its debt-to-total capitalization to 16.6. Despite a $75 billion repurchase authorization, quarterly buybacks have been cut to $2.5–$3 billion, down from $4 billion in previous quarters. If oil prices continue to slide, deeper cuts to shareholder returns may be unavoidable.Strategically, Chevron faces questions around the future of Permian production. The proposed Hess acquisition is expected to bring valuable diversification through the Bakken, potentially easing some of those concerns. However, with investor sentiment around shale turning more cautious, Chevron’s ability to generate meaningful growth from these assets will be a key area to monitor. Meanwhile, global macro headwinds, such as a slowing U.S. economy and geopolitical instability, further cloud demand and price visibility. Add in margin pressure in its CPChem segment and inflation-sensitive Power Solutions venture and the outlook becomes cloudy.Valuation doesn’t help the case either. CVX trades at a forward P/E of 17.55, well above the sector median. As earnings estimates continue to decline, the risk of further multiple compression is real.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-vs-petrobras-either-oil-121700794.html,Financial Risk

With oil prices relatively weak today, conservative income investors would likely be better off following Buffett's lead into Chevron. In fact, the energy giant is a no-brainer buy right now..Chevron is an integrated energy company: It has operations in oil and natural gas extraction, also known as the upstream; in the pipeline and energy transportation space, known as the midstream; and in chemicals and refining, which is known as the downstream. This diversification helps to even out financial performance over time because each segment operates a little differently from the others..Beneath this business structure, Chevron also has a strong financial foundation. The best example of that is its debt-to-equity ratio, which is currently about 0.2. That would be a modest amount of leverage for any company, and it affords Chevron the ability to comfortably add leverage as needed during oil price downturns to support its business and dividend. When oil prices recover, as they always have historically, it reduces its debt load..Chevron's capacity to weather the ups and downs of the historically volatile energy sector is clearly highlighted by its dividend history. Management has increased its payouts for 38 consecutive years, showing that rewarding investors with reliable and growing dividends is one of its key priorities. Conservative income investors looking for an energy stock would do well to pick this Buffett-owned investment..There are a couple of reasons Chevron is worth buying now. First off, at the current share price, its dividend yield is 5%, which is toward the higher end of its historical yield range. In that context, it looks like the stock may be reasonably priced, though it's worth noting that a deep oil downturn would likely push the shares down in the near term, driving the yield even higher. That said, the average energy stock's yield today is roughly 3.6%, so Chevron has a relatively high yield compared to the sector. And looking at Buffett's other oil stock for comparison, Occidental Petroleum's yield is 2.2%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-no-brainer-warren-buffett-100000150.html,Market Risk

Let's shed some light on the development..An aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure..US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a post on X that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s U.S. license to operate in Venezuela will expire on May 27 as planned. On February 26, 2025, President Donald Trump stated that he would revoke the license issued by his predecessor Joe Biden more than two years ago, accusing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns. The oil major had until May 27, 2025, to wrap up its business in the South American country and leave..Notably, Rubio's post contradicted earlier statements by Richard Grenell, the President’s envoy for special missions, who had asserted that the White House is set to extend Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s deadline to halt its operations by another 60 days as negotiations with the Maduro government continue. When asked about these conflicting messages, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce confirmed that Rubio had made it clear that the license 'will expire'..The development comes as a major blow for Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), which has amped up production to supply about 20% of Venezuela’s output and is now a key driver for the country’s economic growth. The oil and gas company had even revealed big plans for its Venezuelan operations, aiming to boost exports from just one of them, Petropiar, by as much as 50% this year to a total of 143,000 barrels daily.

But don't buy a stock just because it has a high yield. You want to own good businesses that have attractive dividend characteristics..Three places to start your search are NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Here's what you need to know about each one..NextEra Energy's dividend yield is around 3% today. That's more than twice the level of the S&P 500 index and a touch better than the average utility's 2.9% yield. The dividend has been increased annually for three decades..But the really interesting fact here is that it has grown at an annualized rate of 10% over the past decade, and management believes it can keep that pace up for the foreseeable future. A mid-single-digit dividend growth rate is considered strong for a utility; 10% is phenomenal..The way NextEra Energy has achieved this is important. First, the foundation of the business is a boring regulated utility that operates in Florida. It has long benefited from migration to the state, but it is still a relatively slow and steady business..Layered on top of this is a second business that builds and runs clean energy assets. There is a long runway for growth as the world increasingly makes use of cleaner energy sources over dirtier ones usually based on carbon fuels. If you are a dividend growth investor, putting $1,000 into NextEra Energy would likely be a good call..Midstream master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners has a lofty 6.6% distribution yield, and the payout has been increased annually for more than a quarter of a century. Although it operates in the highly volatile energy sector, it is actually a very reliable (and boring) business..Midstream companies like Enterprise help to move oil and natural gas from where they are extracted to where they are used. They own things like pipelines and storage assets for which customers pay a fee. The price of the commodities in the system is less important than energy demand, which tends to remain high throughout the energy cycle..That is the business foundation, but Enterprise puts that atop a rock solid investment-grade balance sheet. And its distributable cash flow covered its distribution by 1.7 times in 2024, so there's a lot of room for adversity before the distribution would be at risk. If you are a high-yield investor, this would be a good spot for $1,000 today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-dividend-stocks-133000158.html,Market Risk

The dividend yield is a miserly 1.3% or so. You can do better than that with an index fund focused on the out-of-favor energy sector, but even there, the average yield is ""only"" around 3.5%. You can do much better with Chevron (NYSE: CVX), TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), which offer yields of up to 6.6%..The energy industry tends to be volatile, given the volatile nature of oil and natural gas prices. But Chevron has managed to ride the ups and downs in relative stride, having now increased its dividend annually for 38 consecutive years. With oil relatively weak today, the company's stock price has fallen and the yield has risen to an attractive 4.8%. That's well above the average energy stock..Chevron's business model is the foundation of its success on the dividend front. First, the company's integrated model exposes it to the upstream (drilling for energy), the midstream (pipelines), and the downstream (chemical and refining). This diversification helps to soften the effect of the peaks and valleys the sector goes through. Second, Chevron has a strong balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of around 0.2x today. That would be a low level of leverage for any company, but the key is that it gives management the leeway to lean on the balance sheet during hard times so it can continue to support its business and the dividend..If you are looking for broad exposure to the energy sector, Chevron is usually one of the more attractive options available. And today, given its relatively high dividend yield, it is more attractive than usual..TotalEnergies, which has a 6.5% dividend yield, is also an integrated energy major, like Chevron. So the two companies share a basic business model. That said, the French energy giant tends to carry more debt, so the balance sheet isn't quite as strong. Management also carries more cash, so the net debt-to-equity ratio is on par with Chevron. That's reassuring, but it still isn't the same thing as having less debt. There is a bit more balance sheet risk with TotalEnergies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-high-yield-070500820.html,Investment Risk

Warren Buffett's backing goes back to one of the reasons investors might want to buy Oxy.  There are some reasons investors might prefer other energy stocks.,"One of Occidental Petroleum's biggest claims to fame is that Berkshire Hathaway is a major shareholder..Warren Buffett's backing goes back to one of the reasons investors might want to buy Oxy..There are some reasons investors might prefer other energy stocks..10 stocks we like better than Occidental Petroleum ›.Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) has big aspirations. In fact, the defining features of the energy company today are centered around management's long-term goals. That is true on both the positive side and the negative. Oxy, as the company is more commonly known, could possibly set you up for life, but you should understand what you are getting into when you buy it..In 2019, integrated energy giant Chevron agreed to buy U.S. onshore driller Anadarko Petroleum. The deal made a lot of sense for Chevron, since it would materially expand the company's position in a key U.S. oil production region. Oxy had other ideas, stepping in and starting a bidding war with Chevron. In the end, Oxy won out, with a little assist from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which helped fund Oxy's superior offer..The deal played into Occidental Petroleum's long-term plan to grow its business. The end goal is to compete more directly with integrated giants like Chevron. That's not a bad goal. If Oxy succeeds, it will likely mean material long-term growth, which will clearly have financial benefits for investors. This is the reason you might want to buy Oxy today..In fact, it has since made additional growth moves, most recently buying Crown Rock and Holocene. Crown Rock expands Oxy's oil and natural gas business, while Holocene operates in the carbon capture space, expanding the company's portfolio of energy-related businesses..If Oxy can execute well on its growth plans -- and remember that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway remain large shareholders -- investors will probably end up with solid long-term returns..Building a larger and more diversified energy business is a great plan, but it requires strong execution. On that front, the Anadarko deal was a bit of a disaster. Oxy basically got out over its skis, taking more debt onto its balance sheet than it could handle. That became a problem in 2020 when the energy markets cratered thanks to the economic shutdowns used to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Oxy's stock plunged, and it cut its dividend..Although the dividend is growing again, it remains well below its pre-cut levels. Oxy's stock price, meanwhile, remains well below where it was before the Anadarko transaction. Basically, that deal was a major turning point for the company. Given the tiny dividend yield of 2.2% or so today, Occidental Petroleum is really more of a growth story than an income story. For reference, the average energy stock yields around 3.5% right now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buying-occidental-petroleum-stock-220500278.html,Market Risk Company-Specific Risk

However, this also posed a threat to the United States' energy security itself, as around 240,000 barrels daily of Venezuelan crude was going to Gulf Coast refineries..It must be noted that since 2022, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has been operating in Venezuela despite the sanctions under a US Treasury-issued license to operate that automatically renewed on the first of each month. The energy giant has ramped up production to supply about 20% of Venezuela’s output and is now a key driver for the country's economic growth..Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has big plans for its Venezuelan operations, aiming to boost exports from just one of them, Petropiar, by as much as 50% this year, to a total of 143,000 barrels daily. According to reports from Bloomberg, crude production across Chevron’s four joint ventures in Venezuela surpassed 250,000 b/d last week, up from 40,000 b/d in 2022 before the U.S. sanctions relief began. The American oil major's overall global output stood at 3.35 million boe/d in the first quarter of 2025, so its Venezuelan operations represent a significant chunk of its operations..While we acknowledge the potential of CVX to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.  If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock..READ NEXT: 10 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Most Undervalued Energy Stocks According to Hedge Funds..Disclosure: None.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-extend-chevron-license-operate-215338483.html,Geopolitical Risk

However, as per our long-standing policy, we do not discuss the details of these engagements.”.Chevron's renewed interest in Indonesia comes after its exit from the country in 2023, when it sold its stakes in the Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD)..The IDD, located in the Makassar Strait off Borneo, comprises the Bangka and Gendalo-Gehem projects, which together hold nearly 3tcf of recoverable gas resources..The company also recently withdrew from its Red Sea oil and gas concession blocks in Egypt following unsuccessful exploration attempts..The Egyptian Petroleum Ministry noted that Chevron and other multinational companies are reallocating their efforts to other areas within Egypt, especially the Mediterranean..In 2019, Egypt awarded its first oil and gas exploration concessions in the Red Sea to Chevron, Shell and Mubadala Investment Company. Chevron had a 45% stake in the northern Red Sea Block 1, which it has now relinquished..Furthermore, in April of this year, Indonesia awarded five oil and gas exploration blocks to various companies. This action is part of a strategic initiative to address a ten-year decline in oil and gas production and to enhance national energy security..The country plans to offer nearly 60 blocks in the coming years to attract investment and revitalise its energy sector..""Chevron shows interest in large oil and gas blocks in Indonesia"" was originally created and published by Offshore Technology, a GlobalData owned brand... .The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

183,2025-05-21 21:48:00,Shell's Potential BP Buy: Strategic Scale or a Risky Gamble?,"A potential Shell-BP merger offers scale and synergies, but brings real risks, including integration hurdles and potential financial dilution.","In the wake of blockbuster energy deals like ExxonMobil’s XOM acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron’s CVX pending merger with Hess, speculation around Europe’s largest oil company Shell’s SHEL interest in acquiring smaller rival BP BP has stirred fresh debate. If consummated, a Shell-BP tie-up would reshape the global oil and gas landscape, creating a European supermajor with the scale to rival ExxonMobil and outsize Chevron. However, despite media reports that Shell has been exploring such a deal with advisors, CEO Wael Sawan has reiterated that the bar for mergers and acquisitions remains “very high.” Speaking at Shell’s recent annual general meeting, where he won 98.7% shareholder support, Sawan emphasized that Shell’s current share price makes buybacks a more compelling use of capital. Chair Andrew Mackenzie echoed the sentiment.Nevertheless, here's a closer look at both sides of the potential transaction. Scale Advantage and Competitive Positioning: If Shell acquires BP, the combined company would surpass Chevron in market capitalization and close the gap with ExxonMobil, forming the world’s second-largest publicly traded energy firm. Such scale could strengthen Shell’s leverage in procurement, logistics and technology partnerships. In a world where ExxonMobil and Chevron continue to grow via large-scale acquisitions (e.g., ExxonMobil’s Pioneer and Chevron’s anticipated Hess deals), Shell’s move could be seen as a strategic response to regain influence and secure long-term competitiveness in both upstream and LNG operations.Synergy Potential and Cost Optimization: The merger presents real synergy potential. Shell and BP have overlapping assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Ruwais LNG project. Rationalizing such positions could lead to operational efficiencies and cost reductions. Moreover, divesting redundant downstream assets could unlock capital for reinvestment in Shell’s LNG growth. Administrative and R&D overlaps, if streamlined effectively, may result in meaningful savings, improving return on capital over time and partially cushioning the debt required to fund the deal.BP’s Financial Strain Could Burden Shell: Despite potential synergies, BP’s finances remain a concern. In the first quarter of 2025, Shell earned $4.8 billion, with a high-single-digit profit margin on $70 billion in revenues, while BP generated only $684 million in adjusted net income at a low-single-digit margin. Worse, BP’s $53.8 billion in long-term debt equals over 70% of its current market cap. Shell, by contrast, carries $65.1 billion in debt, just 30% more than its valuation. Taking on BP could dilute Shell’s superior performance, especially in LNG, which is a key profit engine.Integration Risk and Weak Reserve Profiles: Both companies face upstream reserve challenges. Shell holds about 9.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, while BP lags with just 3.7 billion. These limited reserves don’t compare favorably with ExxonMobil or Chevron. A merger might simply combine short-lived portfolios without addressing the structural deficit. Additionally, BP’s strategic shifts—from renewables back to hydrocarbons—may create friction when aligning with Shell’s longer-term plans, risking inefficient capital deployment and integration setbacks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shells-potential-bp-buy-strategic-134800809.html,Operational Risk Financial Risk

Indonesia’s upstream regulator states that the company is eyeing blocks with estimated gas reserves of around 15 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) — a sizable target that reflects its ambitions in Southeast Asia..Indonesia is expected to offer new exploration blocks in regions like Bali and the eastern parts of the country. Although Chevron has not yet confirmed specific details, its early evaluation of some of the potential assets in the country highlights its serious interest in the region’s untapped energy potential..For a long time, Chevron has been facing setbacks in its international operations, specifically in Venezuela and Kazakhstan, due to rising geopolitical complexity. Venezuelan liftings to the United States have halted due to license limitations, and Kazakhstan’s output growth has drawn scrutiny amid OPEC+ dynamics. Therefore, CVX’s interest in Indonesian oil and gas blocks is of utmost importance, as it can create a positive trajectory for the company, given that Indonesia’s assets have high oil and gas output potential..Chevron's interest comes just a few years after it divested from the Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD) project. Located in the Makassar Strait, IDD comprised the Bangka and Gendalo-Gehem gas projects, with a combined recoverable resource of nearly 3 Tcf. Development had stalled due to a redesign of the facility, prompting Chevron to withdraw..Now, the company appears ready to re-enter the Indonesian upstream sector, focusing on larger reserves and potentially more favorable project conditions..Houston, TX-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companiesthat participates in every aspect related to energy —from oil production to refining and marketing.

The work we've done over the past eight years should make one thing clear: we're ready for this.”.The other U.S. supermajor, Chevron, revised down its second-quarter buybacks to a range of between $2 billion and $3.5 billion in share repurchases. The company, however, remains positive about the future cash flows as developments in the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan are set to boost growth.

In Q1, the company averaged 4.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, beat EPS expectations at $1.76, and returned $9.1 billion to shareholders. Capital spending remains locked in at $28 to $33 billion annually through 2030. Exxon projects its breakeven Brent price to drop to $30 by the decade’s end. That’s a fortress balance sheet and a low-cost barrel in one package..Chevron (NYSE: CVX).Chevron is pushing forward, too.

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Chevron (CVX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this oil company have returned +3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +13.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, which Chevron falls in, has gained 4.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Chevron is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of -39.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -35.1% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $6.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.2%. This estimate has changed -20.5% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.95 indicates a change of +29.5% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -20.9%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chevron is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-corporation-cvx-trending-stock-130014389.html,no risk

These talks follow the U.S. government’s decision in March to revoke longstanding licenses that previously allowed limited operational continuity between international firms and PDVSA amid ongoing sanctions.. .The U.S. Treasury Department's revocation of key licenses has thrown major energy partnerships into disarray. These licenses allowed Chevron, a Houston, TX–based integrated oil and gas company, Repsol S.A. REPYY, a Spain-based integrated oil and gas company, and others to maintain a foothold in Venezuela’s lucrative oil sector. Without these authorizations, companies are required to wind down their operations by May 27, leaving critical questions unanswered regarding asset management, staffing and the legal future of billions of dollars in energy infrastructure investments..The uncertainty comes as PDVSA, grappling with economic instability and reduced oil production, has shifted to a model of accepting only prepaid or barter-based oil transactions, canceling multiple cargoes, including those allocated to Chevron.. .Industry insiders reveal that energy giants are appealing to Washington for a reinstatement of the 2020-2022 license framework, which permitted continued presence in Venezuela without allowing production expansion or oil exports. This middle-ground solution would prevent a complete foreign exodus and shield companies from total asset loss while ensuring Venezuela’s state-owned oil and natural gas company does not resume a pattern of unpaid dividends and accumulating debts to its partners.. .Chevron remains the last standing U.S. oil firm in Venezuela, holding minority shares in four key joint ventures responsible for approximately 25% of the country's oil output.

Buffett's company owns 6.8% of the oil giant's outstanding shares (118.6 million shares worth $16.7 billion).  One of Chevron's top investment features is its high-yielding dividend.,"Berkshire Hathaway collects over $800 million in dividend income from Chevron..The oil giant pays a high-yielding dividend supported by a low-cost business and rock-solid financial profile..It has plenty of fuel to continue growing its dividend..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one of the top holdings of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Buffett's company owns 6.8% of the oil giant's outstanding shares (118.6 million shares worth $16.7 billion). It's Berkshire's fifth-largest holding at 5.8% of its investment portfolio. .One of Chevron's top investment features is its high-yielding dividend. Buffett's company stands to collect more than $800 million in dividend income from Chevron this year. .Here's why investors who want to generate passive income should take a closer look at this top Buffett stock..Chevron currently pays its investors $1.71 per share in dividends each quarter ($6.84 annualized). With the oil stock recently trading in the low $140s, it has a 4.9% dividend yield. That's much higher than the average dividend stock (the S&P 500 index's dividend yield is currently around 1.3%). .The oil company's big-time payout is on rock-solid ground. While oil prices can be very volatile, Chevron has a very resilient business. A big factor is its low-cost portfolio of oil and gas resources. It currently has the lowest break-even level for its upstream business in the industry at around $30 a barrel. With crude oil currently in the $60s, Chevron can generate enough cash to cover its dividend payment and capital spending program with room to spare. .Chevron also has an elite balance sheet. The company ended the first quarter with a net debt ratio of 14%. That's at the low end of its peer group and comfortably below its 20% to 25% target range. Chevron's strong balance sheet gives it the flexibility to continue investing capital into growing its business and returning cash to shareholders during periods of lower oil prices. .The oil giant has demonstrated the durability of its dividend over the decades. ""We've grown our dividend for 38 consecutive years, through multiple commodity cycles, leading our peers in growth over the last decade,"" highlighted CFO Eimear Bonner on the oil company's first-quarter earnings conference call. .Chevron is in an excellent position to continue growing its dividend in the future. The oil company currently expects to increase its oil and gas production at around a 6% compound annual rate through next year, fueled by projects in the Gulf of Mexico (also referred to as the Gulf of America in the U.S.), Permian Basin, and Kazakhstan. The company estimates that its investment in growing its high-margin output in those regions will position it to generate an incremental $9 billion in free cash flow by next year at $60 oil.

197,2025-05-18 17:40:00,3 Top Oil Stocks That Can Still Thrive Even Though Oil Prices Have Dropped Into the $60s,TotalEnergies says it can still afford to pay its dividend even if oil prices fall to $50.  ExxonMobil is going all out to lower its breakeven price.  Chevron has the lowest breakeven level in the oil patch.,"TotalEnergies says it can still afford to pay its dividend even if oil prices fall to $50..ExxonMobil is going all out to lower its breakeven price..Chevron has the lowest breakeven level in the oil patch..10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil ›.Crude oil prices have slumped this year. Brent, the global oil price benchmark, has fallen more than 10% on the year, pushing it into the low $60s. That slump will impact the cash flows that oil companies produce..However, some oil stocks are in a better position to handle lower oil prices than others. TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their ability to continue thriving at lower crude prices. Here's a closer look at these top-tier oil stocks..Reuben Gregg Brewer (TotalEnergies): With a diversified business model, TotalEnergies is well positioned to weather the ups and downs in oil prices. But that's true of every integrated oil company's diversified business model. What sets one oil major apart from another runs a bit deeper. For example, Chevron and ExxonMobil have low leverage, which allows them to take on debt during downturns to support their businesses and dividends. TotalEnergies, like European peers BP and Shell, makes higher use of debt..But don't count TotalEnergies out because of that. It also carries a lot more cash, which brings its net debt-to-equity ratio down to around 15%. That's roughly in-line with Exxon and Chevron. Higher debt and more cash on the balance sheet aren't the same as just having less debt, but it suggests that TotalEnergies is more resilient to lower oil prices than investors might think..That said, the real issue here is oil prices. And management is pretty clear that $60 a barrel isn't a problem. In fact, there wouldn't be a potential problem until $50 a barrel. That's because the company's break-even point, after paying the dividend, is below $50. There's a lot more room for adversity on the oil price front before there's a problem here..So if you are wondering if TotalEnergies' lofty 6.7% dividend yield is sustainable even as oil prices drop into the $60s, the answer is yes because of its diversified business, strong finances, and efficient operations..Neha Chamaria (ExxonMobil): In the oil and gas industry value chain, exploration and production companies -- also known as upstream companies -- take the biggest hit from falling oil prices since their earnings and cash flows rely heavily on energy prices. ExxonMobil's upstream segment accounted for almost 70% of its earnings in 2024. Yet, ExxonMobil is the kind of oil stock that has the wherewithal to not only survive but thrive during a down cycle thanks primarily to its financial discipline.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-oil-stocks-still-094000286.html,market risk

Integrated energy giant Chevron is one of the Dow's ""dogs"" today.  One simple approach to stock selection that has gained notoriety is to buy the five highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), a system that has become known as the ""Dogs of the Dow.""","The ""Dogs of the Dow"" is an investment approach that focuses on buying the highest-yielding Dow stocks..Integrated energy giant Chevron is one of the Dow's ""dogs"" today..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.Investors are always looking for a unique edge that helps them pick stocks. One simple approach to stock selection that has gained notoriety is to buy the five highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), a system that has become known as the ""Dogs of the Dow."" Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one of those ""dogs"" today, but is it worth buying this energy-tied business?.Chevron is an integrated energy company, which means that its business spans across the energy sector. That includes energy production (the upstream), energy transportation (the midstream), and refining and chemicals (the downstream). Each of the segments operates a little differently and performs a little differently through the energy cycle. This is a key factor to keep in mind when you are looking at Chevron because this diversification helps to soften the peaks and valleys that are normal in the energy sector..Given the importance of oil and natural gas prices to the top line, Chevron can't completely avoid the often dramatic and swift swings that happen in the energy sector. But it won't be as volatile as a company that is solely focused on producing oil and natural gas. Nor will it be as volatile as a business focused around the downstream, where both the inputs and the products are commodities. However, when low oil prices are hampering Chevron's upstream operations they may be helping its downstream businesses, which use oil and natural gas as inputs..If you are looking for some energy exposure, Chevron is a good all-around choice. But that is only partly because of its diversified business model. Another important factor is the company's financial strength. With a debt-to-equity ratio of around 0.2, this integrated energy giant has a very strong balance sheet. That gives it the financial wherewithal to take on debt during energy downturns to support its business and its dividend. So Chevron's business is designed from the ground up to survive the inherent swings in the energy sector..Energy prices have been a little weak lately. And, as you might expect, Chevron's stock has been weak, too. It has dropped around 25% from its 2022 highs, when oil prices were stronger. But don't view that drop in a vacuum. Pure-play driller Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) has seen its price decline by a whopping 55% over roughly the same span. Thus, Chevron's stock is performing just like you would hope in the current environment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogs-dow-high-yield-stock-070500115.html,Investment Strategy Risk

With 38 years of dividend increases and a high yield, Chevron is an intriguing income play.  Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is an integrated oil and gas major with a growing exploration and production business, sizable refining segment, investments in low-carbon solutions, and more.","Oil and gas giant Chevron has an industry-leading breakeven point on its upstream portfolio..The company can support its massive capital return program without jeopardizing its financial health..With 38 years of dividend increases and a high yield, Chevron is an intriguing income play..10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›.Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is an integrated oil and gas major with a growing exploration and production business, sizable refining segment, investments in low-carbon solutions, and more. But the stock has fallen roughly 16% from its 52-week high -- a swift decline considering the high came less than two months ago..With a yield of 4.8%, here's why Chevron is an excellent dividend stock for passive income investors to scoop up now..Brent crude oil prices (the international benchmark) are at multi-year lows -- which has put pressure on Chevron's margins and led to lower revenue and earnings growth. In turn, these factors have weighed on its stock price..However, Chevron has become a much more efficient company. On its first-quarter earnings call, Chevron said it was delivering growth initiatives -- led by short-cycle onshore projects and high-margin offshore projects that are expected to generate an incremental $9 billion of free cash flow (FCF) in 2026 at a $60-per-barrel Brent price, which is below the current price..Chevron cited Wood Mackenzie data showing it has the lowest upstream breakeven of its peer group -- around the low $30-per-barrel Brent range. According to Wood Mackenzie, that gives Chevron a lower breakeven than ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, BP, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Diamondback Energy, and EOG Resources..In its investor presentation on May 6, Chevron said it expects to achieve a 50% increase in its Gulf Coast production by 2026 thanks to the expansion of its deepwater Anchor project, which achieved first production in August 2024. Lower drilling costs have helped keep Anchor under budget..In sum, Chevron is still delivering excellent results despite lower oil prices. Its highly efficient production portfolio supports its massive buyback program..Chevron bought back a record amount of stock each year over the last three years -- $11.26 billion in 2022, $14.94 billion in 2023, and $15.23 billion in 2024..With buybacks of $3.9 billion in the first quarter and plans for $2.5 billion to $3 billion in buybacks in the second quarter, Chevron is on schedule to pull back slightly on stock repurchases in 2025 but still return a boatload of cash to shareholders. The move to keep a lid on buybacks makes sense given lower oil prices and its planned deal to purchase Hess.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/near-52-week-low-heres-114500515.html,Low Risk
