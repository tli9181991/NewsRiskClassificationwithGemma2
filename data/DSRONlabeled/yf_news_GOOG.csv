I'm Josh Lipton and for the next half hour, we are breaking down the trends of today that will move stocks tomorrow. There's a lot to keep track of, so we're focusing on what you need to know to get ahead of the curve. AI is still alive and well on Wall Street, but the landscape keeps changing as various players enter the AI arena. For more on what you need to know about the biggest names in the game, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Tech editor, and that would be Dan Howley. Dan. .That's right, Josh. We're just going to break down some of the, the bigger names. So to start things off, obviously the 800 pound gorilla, that's OpenAI, and we're going to put Microsoft in there together with them since they have teamed up. Obviously, it's been a very lucrative relationship between the two. Uh, OpenAI has ChatGPT kind of kicked off the entire generative AI explosion. Uh, Microsoft has been using that technology in its co-pilot and and its Azure platform. But more recently, the two were at loggerheads. They can't come to an agreement over how OpenAI should restructure its own business. And so that is leading to some reports that Microsoft may be, you know, trying to work on its own generative AI offerings while OpenAI may be trying to work on its own productivity suites. But after OpenAI and Microsoft, there's obviously Google. Uh, we have their Gemini service. It's similar to what you would get out of ChatGPT. Uh, they offer document creation. Uh, you can upload files, you can create images, things along those lines, but it also has the power of Google behind it. You might have probably used Gemini if you've used basically any Google product at this point because it's across the entire company's ecosystem, whether that's through YouTube, mail, docs, even your regular Google search, when you see AI overviews, that's powered by Gemini. Then after that, we have obviously Meta. Uh, Mark Zuckerberg is trying to recadjigger the company once again after the metaverse fiasco that didn't really go anywhere except for give us some weird looking legless avatars. Uh, now he's going all in on AI, and they seem to be doing relatively well here. Uh, they obviously have Meta AI. It's available through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The problem though is their most recent model called Lama for Behemoth seems to be delayed, and there's no end in sight for when that delay will end. And so now, Meta is going out and scooping up talent from other AI companies, whether that's the CEO of Scale AI, Alexander Wang. Uh, we also had Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO, uh and Safe Super Intelligence, their CEO, Daniel Gross. They've all been packed up. Uh, Sam Altman at OpenAI said Meta is trying to offer some of his employees hundred million dollars to sign on. So I said that on a podcast with his brother, so we can't really know if that's for certain. Uh, after that, obviously, there's some others. There's XAI. That's from Elon Musk. He offers Grock through that. That is their chatbot. You can get it through X. Uh, you can use it on the website or through an app. Big thing about Grock is it's able to pull data not only from the web, but also from X, so it can get live data through there. Then we have others, we have Perplexity. That is basically a search engine built with generative AI in mind. Probably the best example of a competitor to what Google has to offer. Uh, it also has a lot of sourcing available, so it'll show you the sources of each, from each of those results that you search for. Obviously, you can also generate images if you want to do that, things along those lines. Uh, and then finally, we have Anthropic. That's gotten a lot of funding through Google and Amazon. It's available through a number of services, and they as well offer a kind of web browser experience where you can search, you can create different documents and things along those lines. But really, those are the major players that you have to be watching out for. There's a few others. Uh, obviously, we have Thinking Machines from OpenAI alumni. We also have a few others like Mistral out of France. Uh, but these seven here are really the biggest players at the moment. .All right. Thank you, Dan.

Wolf told Fortune that today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions. “In science, asking the question is the hard part,” he said. “Once the question is asked, often the answer is quite obvious, but the tough part is really asking","Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer at Hugging Face, has cast doubt on the belief that current artificial intelligence systems will lead to major scientific breakthroughs..Wolf told Fortune that today's large language models, or LLMs, excel at providing answers but fall short when it comes to formulating original questions..“In science, asking the question is the hard part,” he said. “Once the question is asked, often the answer is quite obvious, but the tough part is really asking the question, and models are very bad at asking great questions.”.Don't Miss:.GoSun's breakthrough rooftop EV charger already has 2,000+ units reserved — become an investor in this $41.3M clean energy brand today..Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market. Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential..Wolf’s comments were in response to a blog post by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who argues that artificial intelligence could compress a century's worth of scientific breakthroughs into just a few years..Wolf said he initially found the post compelling but became skeptical after rereading. “It was saying AI is going to solve cancer, and it's going to solve mental health problems—it's going to even bring peace into the world. But then I read it again and realized there's something that sounds very wrong about it, and I don't believe that,” he told Fortune..San Francisco-based Anthropic is backed by tech giants, including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), and is also known for its Claude family of AI models..For Wolf, the core issue lies in how LLMs are trained. In another blog post, Wolf argues that today’s AI systems are built to predict likely outcomes, act as ""yes-men on servers,"" capable of mimicking human responses but incapable of challenging assumptions or generating original ideas..""To create an Einstein in a data center, we don't just need a system that knows all the answers, but rather one that can ask questions nobody else has thought of or dared to ask,"" Wolf wrote..He cited that real scientific progress often comes from paradigm shifts—like Copernicus proposing heliocentrism or the invention of CRISPR-based gene editing—rather than from answering existing questions..Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100..Wolf also questioned how AI performance is measured today. In his blog post, he pointed to benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam or Frontier Math, which test how well AI models can answer complex but well-defined questions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hugging-face-co-founder-challenges-040151444.html,Technology Risk

5,2025-06-27 00:18:00,There Are Currently Better Options Than Microsoft,The reason other Mag-7 stocks are more attractive at the moment.,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies, belonging to the mag-7 and being the biggest company in the world according to market capitalization. While MSFT is definitely a great company, this article will show why it currently is not a buy for me, mainly because there are better deals in other mag-7 companies at lower valuations and better fundamentals..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96%..The same can also be said for growth. While MSFT is not as far ahead of other companies as it was in terms of profitability, a revenue growth rate of 14.13% and an EBITDA growth rate of 19.16% are still great. Furthermore, forward growth rates are even stronger than current ones, suggesting a positive outlook. Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE growth expected to be negative..As with all Mag-7 companies, valuation is the biggest problem for Microsoft. Everyone already knows that we are talking about a great company, so the most important thing to get right is to find a good entrance price. Currently, the EV/EBITDA ratio of the stock is relatively high at 22.8, a 31% premium to the industry median. Moreover, the P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium, respectively. The P/E ratio at 35.11 is also very high at the moment. Figure 1 shows the historical P/E ratio of MSFT as can be seen, the company currently trades at 2020 and 2023 levels, leaving it at a higher bound of its average valuation..When comparing Microsoft's user base to that of other Mag-7 companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), one can instantly see that the company's valuation is elevated. At around 1.5 billion users and a market cap of 3.35T, the company has a valuation of $2.233 per user. At the same time, GOOG and META only have valuations of $820 and $494 per user, respectively, making them much cheaper in comparison. Additionally, ROE is a weak point too, with only Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) being worse at 8.79% and 25.24%, respectively..From a growth perspective, Microsoft is solid but does not particularly stand out at slightly better revenue growth but significantly less EBITDA growth than Alphabet. Furthermore, the negative ROE growth is the second worst in the peer group, with only Tesla's ROE falling by almost 70%. In total, Microsoft seems fundamentally somewhere around the average, with profitability being a strength while growth is a comparative weakness.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currently-better-options-microsoft-093720326.html,market risk

Executives at Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. have said that AI is producing about 30% of new computer software code on some projects. Salesforce has said that use of AI internally has allowed it to hire fewer people..The San Francisco-based software company is focused on selling an AI product that promises to handle tasks such as customer service without human supervision. Benioff said that tool has reached about 93% accuracy, including for large customers such as Walt Disney Co..“All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI can do things that before we were doing,” Benioff said. “We can move on to do higher-value work.”.In the 2000s, Salesforce revolutionized the way software was sold by offering its customer-management tool over the internet. Now, as the industry pivots to AI, Benioff is fighting to keep Salesforce’s spot as a leading platform by weaving the new technology through it..This episode of The Circuit With Emily Chang premiers at 8 a.m. New York time on the Bloomberg app and Bloomberg.com.

Trump has chided the EU — which he has said was created to “screw” the US — over its goods surplus and perceived barriers to American trade. The EU estimates that US duties now cover €380 billion ($446 billion), or about 70%, of its exports to the US..Over recent months, the US President has specifically called out the EU’s tech regulations as the kind of non-tariff trade barrier that his so-called reciprocal tariffs are intended to target with the White House signaling out previous EU penalties as a form of tariff..Despite the threats, the EU has pressed ahead with enforcement of its digital antitrust rules, with recent fines against Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. of €500 million and €200 million respectively..Ribera, a Spanish socialist, added Thursday that negotiations with Apple had been going “very well” since that April EU ultimatum on how the company should re-engineer its hugely profitable App Store in order to comply with the DMA. She said an update in the case would be coming soon..Over recent years the EU has issued costly penalties against firms, including more than $8 billion in fines against Alphabet Inc.’s Google and a separate order for Apple to pay Ireland back taxes of €13 billion..Under its abuse-of-dominance rules, it has also forced changes out of Amazon.com Inc.’s marketplace platform and Apple’s tap-and-go chip, while also investigating Microsoft Corp. video conference software, Teams..Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek.Inside Gap’s Last-Ditch, Tariff-Addled Turnaround Push.How to Steal a House.Luxury Counterfeiters Keep Outsmarting the Makers of $10,000 Handbags.Apple Test-Drives Big-Screen Movie Strategy With F1.Ken Griffin on Trump, Harvard and Why Novice Investors Won’t Beat the Pros.©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-ribera-won-t-trade-082329011.html,Regulatory Risk   Geopolitical Risk

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been one of the worst-performing mega-cap stocks in 2025. Its shares have been weighed down by weak cloud performance and antitrust action. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s shares have lost 12% year-to-date as the stock has tried to factor in a loss of business with Apple. Apple pays Alphabet Inc.

However, quizzically, he wondered recently whether he sold the stock too soon:.“I don’t know [on how much OpenAI is worth] but I sold Alphabet too soon.”.Recently, Cramer wasn’t convinced about Alphabet Inc.

Altering those cells to make genetically modified children is intended to eliminate inherited diseases or enhance desirable traits, which can be passed on to future generations..Scientists and ethicists said the technology known as “germline editing” is unproven and potentially dangerous. It could have grave consequences if a flaw is introduced into a days-old embryo, with the changes affecting every cell and stage of development. If the technology does work, they fear it could usher in a new era of eugenics and foster further inequality..“When you’re messing with the safety of babies, you want to be pretty confident,” said Hank Greely, a Stanford University law professor and bioethics expert. “We have no idea what would happen to the babies who are edited.”.Experts would be especially concerned if the efforts are conducted in private laboratories without public access, oversight, review or protection, said Laurie Zoloth, a professor of religion and ethics at the University of Chicago..“There are safer ways to avoid having a child with a genetic disease than trying to build one from scratch as if it’s some sort of commodity that you put together with cool parts,” she said..Chief Executive Officer Chase Denecke and Chief Technology Officer Ben Korpan founded Bootstrap Bio after writing a viral essay using the pen names GeneSmith and kman on LessWrong, a forum popular in Silicon Valley. The essay was about about gene editing adults to make them smarter. Subsequent Reddit posts by Gene_Smith discussed the work, and Denecke — using his own name — spoke about it in an interview on YouTube..Denecke declined to comment. Korpan didn’t respond to multiple requests for interviews or comment for this story..Genetic Pivot.Follow up posts from Gene_Smith on Reddit detailed changes in the company’s focus, including Bootstrap Bio’s switch from working on gene editing the DNA of adults to plans for the genetic modification of reproductive cells. Gene_Smith said the company hired a chief science officer, opened a lab and pivoted its work, and was planning to raise seed funding earlier this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/superbabies-startup-seeks-funds-controversial-140038482.html,High Risk
19,2025-06-25 21:00:00,Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Here is What You Need to Know,"Alphabet (GOOG) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this company have returned -3.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.18 indicates a change of +6.8% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-alphabet-inc-130004022.html,no risk

Yal Finanz Prize Submarine is here with that story, Prize. .Yeah, we're just showing that the Hollywood set where they did the actual presentation last October didn't go exactly as planned. We saw a lot of the Tesla stands excited about taking their robotaxis right. But there were some hiccups, right? We saw some of the videos that they were taking some of the vehicles were speeding above post speed limits. And then most egregiously, there was an incident where a car, you see right here, attempted to turn left, didn't actually do that, and went straight through a left hand turn only lane, and then crossed a double yellow, as you see here, which is also a traffic violation, a major one actually in Texas. So Nizza says that they're aware of these incidents, and they're monitoring them, and that they'll take necessary actions to protect road safety. So Nizza is kind of possibly getting involved here. Meanwhile, Waymo entering Atlanta, like they said they're officially up open for business with partnering with Uber as their sort of platform partner. So you know, Waymo's with Uber in Atlanta, and also Austin, where Tesla's tests is taking place. And then also they're in LA, San Francisco, um, and places like that. .Do you think, Prize, you you hear about something like this, does it in any way, could it in any way slow down, disrupt the expansion of this service across the country? .You mean these little hiccups here? Yeah. I, it kind of brings a little bit of the enthusiasm down, but it's not ready for prime time, right? They have the safety drivers, riders sitting in the passenger seat, you have teleoperators who are remotely watching the car. You know, a lot of Tesla investors are excited about the fact that this test actually started, it's happening. But they have a long way to go to catch up to Waymo, which is doing 250,000 completed robotaxi trips a week without sort of these incidents that we're seeing right now in Tesla. .All right, let's bring in our ensemble now for more on the ride shares today. Tesla, got a Google, Uber, Lyft, they're all in focus. Julie, you know, I, Tesla did slip a bit today, of course they had a nice pop yesterday. Though, as Prize rightfully points out, as Musk begins this journey here, he's got some big competition, including Waymo. .Yeah, I mean, and if if there are these hiccups, I mean, as we know, federal regulators have sort of left it up to states and municipalities, whether they're even going to allow these things to go forward. You see it going forward on a city by city basis, right? So even though Tesla is still proceeding with its tests in Austin, if it continues to see, I mean, like, we're calling it a hiccup, but, you know, it could have been a lot worse, right? So the question is, how is Tesla addressing these issues? And then the next question is, when Tesla goes to apply for its next approval in its next city, is this going to inform that? Is this going to then cause some friction with letting that move forward? Now, we always know if we're on an Elon Musk timeline, you can't necessarily expect things to happen as he thinks or says that they will. Um, but this is just one more thing to consider when we're talking about that sort of speed to market, and then capturing that market share. .Chris, I want to bring you here as well, as the one person on the panel who actually has a portfolio to run here. What do you make of this big fight? I got Tesla, Waymo, got Amazon in there, Uber, Lyft. .Yeah, it's kind of a crowded space. Uh, you know, and it's kind of an emerging market. Uh, I, I think that this is going to be proven out over time. I think that the interesting way to play it from a, you know, differentiated way is, maybe we don't focus necessarily on, uh, you know, what Google is doing or Tesla is doing, but what does this mean for Uber? What does this mean for Lyft when we think about the removal of a key cost for them, right? And the amount of incremental profits that can drop to the bottom line once they have made these investments. To me, that's a lot more exciting.

Specifically, Zuckerberg explained how these companies often restrict Meta’s ability to innovate within their ecosystems, citing Apple’s iMessage as a powerful “lock-in” that discourages users from switching platforms. This competitive environment has influenced Meta’s decision to invest heavily and early in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, even before the market is fully mature..Zuckerberg says the strategy is actually working, as shown by the latest release of Apple Vision Pro, which largely failed due to its poor design, $3,500 price tag, and lack of relevant features or utility.

Google says that while the model was trained for ALOHA robots, it later adapted it to work on a bi-arm Franka FR3 robot and the Apollo humanoid robot by Apptronik..Google claims the bi-arm Franka FR3 was successful in tackling scenarios and objects it hadn’t “seen” before, like doing assembly on an industrial belt..Google DeepMind is also releasing a Gemini Robotics SDK. The company said developers can show robots 50 to 100 demonstrations of tasks to train them on new tasks using these models on the MuJoCo physics simulator..Other AI model developers are also dipping their toes in robotics.

However, at a little over 16 times estimated profits, its valuation is a fraction of Tesla’s at 150 times, a multiple based heavily on expectations for a service that investors had been waiting years for..“People are underestimating Waymo in a pretty significant way, while overestimating Tesla,” said Samuel Rines, macro strategist at WisdomTree. Alphabet’s valuation “assigns basically zero value to Waymo even though it has the best tech, it is already operating, and it has deals with OEMs,” referring to original equipment manufacturers..Alphabet rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla shares were little changed..Investor excitement about self-driving technology is rooted in the vast size of the potential market. Annual ride-hailing sales could exceed $325 billion by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. As much as $20 billion of that could come from robotaxis, analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a research note on Monday..Waymo currently offers self-driving paid rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and San Francisco and just began offering trips through Uber Technologies Inc.’s platform in Atlanta, with Miami and Washington expected next year. Last week, Waymo applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City, sending Uber and Lyft Inc. shares lower..Waymo was valued at more than $45 billion in October, putting it roughly on par with the market capitalizations of both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. It’s a drop in the bucket for Alphabet, however, with a market value of more than $2 trillion..Still, Waymo is an increasingly attractive part of Alphabet’s portfolio and should offer “long-term upside” for shareholders, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-lacks-tesla-stock-buzz-101252621.html,Reputational Risk
39,2025-06-24 21:16:00,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Tesla, eBay, PayPal and Alphabet",Tesla's invite-only robotaxi launch in Austin sparks a 6% stock surge as investors cheer its cautious debut strategy.,"Chicago, IL – June 24, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Tesla TSLA, eBay EBAY, PayPal PYPL and Alphabet GOOGL..Tesla shares are breaking out today after the world’s leadingelectric vehicle manufacturer finally launched its long-awaited and often delayed robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. TSLA shares are breaking out above multi-week highs and are up more than 6% in early trading as volume turnover is swelling and tracking to levels of more than 60% above the 50-day average volume..Silicon Valley legends like Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t get to where they are without massive risk-taking and a ‘move fast, break things’ approach. For instance, after Elon Musk scored his first $175 million fortune with the successful sale of PayPal to eBay,he immediately began deploying most (but not all) of his capital to his new endeavors – SpaceX and Tesla..However, when the 2008 Global Financial Crisis hit, Musk was forced to risk all of his capital (and actually had to borrow money) to survive. The bet paid off, and the rest is history – Musk became the wealthiest person on Earth..Whether it’s X.com (formally Twitter) or SpaceX, Musk prefers to move at lightning speed and fix mistakes later. Nevertheless, Musk is wisely taking a measured approach with the robotaxi debut since the stakes are high. With global car sales slumping and Musk’s recent political, reputational damage, Tesla’s robotaxi service must move forward without a hitch..As a result, Tesla is debuting the robotaxi in a geo-fenced-in zone, charging a low fee of $4.20, and has a safety rider in the front passenger seat to ensure the debut goes smoothly. Thus far, investors are cheering the measured side of Elon Musk..The robotaxi launch is invite-only and includes social media personalities and investors. Tesla is using modified Model Y vehicles (the best-selling car currently) with updated software instead of the futuristic Cybercab concept Musk initially pitched..The move to use Model Ys was likely to avoid falling further behind Alphabet’s rapidly expanding ‘Waymo’ robotaxi service. With Waymo already operating in Austin, investors will be watching to see which service clients choose once Tesla opens up its robotaxi service to the public..Between Musk’s controversies and slowing sales, TSLA still has its fair share of skeptics. For example, prominent short seller Jim Chanos is bearish on the company, citing valuation concerns and competition. However, these skeptics will likely have to eat their words if Musk and his Tesla team can scale its robotaxi service into 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-131600943.html,Operational Risk

""This stock trades at ten times revenue. You have a [stock] multiple that's insane."".Washington Crossing Advisors is wholly owned by boutique investment bank Stifel (SF). It has about $2 billion in assets under management..Morganlander said he personally owns tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which operates the more established Waymo autonomous taxi service. Waymo first launched its driverless taxis in Phoenix in 2018..""Waymo has been proven, and it's working in many cities,"" Morganlander explained. ""And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. We would pick Alphabet instead."".Listen: Why Qualcomm's CEO is all in on car tech.To Morganlander's point, there remains a large disconnect between Tesla's valuation and its fundamentals. It extends beyond the stock's revenue multiple, including its lofty forward price to earnings multiple of 178 times. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) trades at roughly 21 times..This comes as consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 have plunged 77%, 70%, and 71% for Tesla since October 2022, according to new research from JPMorgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman..You can study Tesla's falling EPS for yourself on the Yahoo Finance platform..Meanwhile, the EV tax credits that have supported demand for Tesla vehicles are likely going away soon under the Trump administration..Read more: How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance.These tax credits have been a driver of Tesla's sales and profits. Brinkman estimates EV subsidies represent about 52% of Tesla's current profits, which could be wiped out by Trump's ""big, beautiful bill."".And lastly, in April Tesla reported top and bottom line misses for the first quarter due to waning EV demand and controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk's political activities..""You look at that multiple and it's hard to imagine them growing into that in any short period of time,"" Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz said on Opening Bid. ""As with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon Musk thinks and investors think.

Companies are racing to build their best platform, which is no small task, considering how difficult quantum computing is to do well.  Quantum computing isn't currently deployed at any scale, as the companies involved are still trying to prove its worth with various workloads.","Alphabet kicked off the quantum computing investment hype in December..IonQ's platform offers several key advantages over some of its competitors..10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›.Quantum computing is just in its infancy. Companies are racing to build their best platform, which is no small task, considering how difficult quantum computing is to do well. Quantum computing isn't currently deployed at any scale, as the companies involved are still trying to prove its worth with various workloads. However, should a company offer a compelling quantum computing solution, the stock could take off and become an absolute monster..Two stocks that I believe could become monsters in the quantum computing world are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). Both companies can massively benefit from a successful quantum computing deployment and are my top picks in the quantum computing investment realm..Alphabet kicked off the latest round of investor interest in quantum computing in December when it announced that its Willow quantum computing chip completed a five-minute task that would have taken 10 septillion years (10 to the 25th power) to complete. Now, this computation is only possible using quantum computing, so this test is in Willow's favor, but it noted a significant breakthrough..Quantum computing differs from traditional computing because it uses qubits instead of bits. While bits transmit information as either a 0 or a 1, qubits can have values ranging between 0 and 1, which allows them to process an infinitely larger amount of information per computing unit. However, because the answer isn't exactly a 0 or a 1, this can introduce errors into the calculation..Solving this basic quantum computing problem has been the goal of every company involved in the quantum computing arms race, and each company has come up with its own solution for mitigating errors..Alphabet's solution was to place qubits in a particular grid, allowing them to interact with each other. This interaction has been proven to reduce errors, providing Alphabet with a viable quantum computing solution, as its two-qubit gate fidelity was 99.86%..IonQ takes this grid approach a step further. Every qubit in its system is connected to every other qubit, which it refers to as all-to-all connectivity. They believe this offers a superior solution to any system that doesn't allow every qubit to interact with each other. It has enabled them to achieve a 99.9% or greater two-qubit gate fidelity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-quantum-computing-stocks-could-103000861.html,Emerging Technology Risk

These included providing extra choice for users between search products and clear attribution for publishers when their content is used to generate answers using artificial intelligence (AI)..It also said it would consider whether news publishers should be paid for how their content is used by Google, although it delayed this decision to next year..Oliver Bethell, the senior director of competition at Google, said: “The UK has historically benefitted from early access to our latest innovations, but punitive regulations could change that..“Proportionate, evidence-based regulation will be essential to preventing the CMA’s roadmap from becoming a roadblock to growth in the UK.”.A source close to the investigation suggested that the CMA was not in “lockstep” with the Government and its growth agenda..The CMA’s crackdown on “big tech” has clashed with Labour’s push to cut red tape and make Britain a more attractive place to invest. In January, Marcus Bokkerink, the CMA’s chairman, was forced out by ministers over concerns the regulator was not aligned with Labour’s efforts to boost growth..In a speech in December, Sir Keir Starmer took aim at “the regulators, blockers and bureaucrats” whom he said were hurting the UK economy..On Tuesday, the CMA said its planned measures would “help unlock broader growth, investment and innovation in the UK tech sector and wider economy”..It will make its final decision on its designation of Google in October..Google search accounts for more than 90pc of all queries in the UK, far eclipsing rivals like Microsoft’s Bing and new services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The average Briton makes between five and 10 Google searches per day..For years, news groups, rival technology companies, online retailers and travel providers have warned that Google’s dominance of the internet has distorted markets and threatened their businesses – prompting competition scrutiny around the world..The CMA’s findings are its first under new powers brought in this year, providing it with wide-ranging authority to demand tech giants change how their products work, hit them with fines, or even break them up.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-fights-monopoly-inquiry-attack-102147018.html,Regulatory Risk

Its pivot away from first-party games and toward a pure platform model has sharpened margins and heightened market attention, but it also sets a high bar the platform must keep clearing..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with APP..In this article, I analyze the company's business evolution, unpack its platform economics, test whether the current financial trajectory warrants today's premium valuation, and finish with where I believe the stock can go next..AppLovin began as a hybrid model, operating both a software platform for mobile app marketing and a portfolio of its own mobile games (Apps segment). This dual structure allowed AppLovin to bootstrap its advertising algorithms with first-party data from its games, but it also meant the company was part game publisher and part ad-tech provider. In 2024, the Software Platform (Advertising) segment contributed about 68% of revenue, while the Apps (gaming) segment was 32%. However, advertising revenue grew 75% year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, whereas Apps revenue grew only 3%. This trend accelerated into early 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, advertising revenue soared 71% YoY to $1.159 billion, while Apps revenue fell 14%. Clearly, AppLovin's future lies in its high-growth ad-tech platform..With that in mind, management made a strategic move of divesting the entire Apps segment. AppLovin announced an agreement to sell its mobile gaming portfolio (about 10 studios and hit titles like Cash Tornado and Wordscapes) to Tripledot Studios for roughly $400 million in cash and around a 20% equity stake in Tripledot. CEO Adam Foroughi said while acquiring game studios years ago helped train AppLovin's machine learning models, we have never been a game developer at heart. In other words, AppLovin's core identity is as a technology platform for app monetization and marketing, not as a content creator. By divesting the games, the company sheds a slow-growth, lower-margin segment. The sale also eliminates any conflict of interest with its clients (third-party app developers). They may have been wary of relying on an ad network that also owned competing games..Source: AppLovin.At its core, AppLovin offers an end-to-end software platform that helps app developers acquire users and monetize their apps. Key components include AppDiscovery (user acquisition campaigns), the AppLovin Exchange (ad network marketplace), and MAX mediation (the leading in-app bidding platform that maximizes ad revenue for publishers). AppLovin's secret sauce is its data and AI engine, dubbed AXON. AXON is a sophisticated machine learning system that ingests billions of data points from across AppLovin's network (ad impressions, clicks, installs, and in-app events) to optimize advertising in real time. Because AppLovin historically operated its own games and, critically, owns the mediation layer (MAX), it enjoys a rich stream of first-party data with every ad impression and user action. This vertical integration (ad network + mediation + first-party content) created a closed loop of data that competitors struggled to match.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applovin-80-margins-survive-outside-094035178.html,Strategic Risk

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday.

Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions. The company expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. Management execution has been good in recent times, which has helped Alphabet to build solid cash and short-term investment balance. Additionally, GOOGL's earnings are expected to grow 18.3% for the current fiscal year. .Intuit Inc. (INTU) is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals globally.Intuit’s recent performance has been benefiting from steady revenues from the Online Ecosystem and Desktop business segments. Strong momentum in Online Services revenues driven by strong performances of Mailchimp, payroll and Money, which includes payments, capital and bill pay. The Credit Karma business is benefiting from strength in Credit Karma Money, credit cards, auto insurance and personal loans. INTU’s strategy of shifting its business to a cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. After reaching an important support level, Intuit should be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. INTU surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. Shares of INTU have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 5.7%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, suggesting that INTU could be poised for a continued surge.

Only select invited Tesla users were invited to test the robotaxi service in Austin..Scaling a robotaxi business that could take on industry leader Waymo (GOOG, GOOGL) would take thousands of vehicles operating without safety operators, as well as creating the infrastructure to clean and service the robotaxis..While some see the robotaxi launch as the start of a new era, others think the scale issue will be a big one..""We believe the much better question ahead is on the path of scaling, which we believe will be long, and we caution against overoptimism,"" Barclays' Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients Monday morning. Levy has an Equal weight rating (the equivalent of Hold) and a $275 price target..In addition to scale, there is a big concern over safety. Other players, like GM’s Cruise (GM) and Uber (UBER), had to cease operations following high-profile accidents, with an Uber test leading to a pedestrian death..Earlier on Monday Reuters reported that Tesla said answers to regulator NHTSA's questions regarding safety of its robotaxi operations was confidential business information, and should not be made public..Nonetheless, Wall Street bulls were cheering Tesla’s early success..“We took two approximately 15 minute rides around Austin and the key takeaways are that it was a comfortable, safe, and personalized experience,” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note published late Sunday. Ives has an Outperform rating on Tesla and a lofty $500 price target..In a particularly tense moment, Ives said, the robotaxi drove up a hill on a narrow road with cars parked on both sides, oncoming traffic, and people opening their car doors into the road, but the robotaxi “masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety among this chaos.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-pops-8-after-foundational-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-200136126.html,Operational Risk

In April 2025, xAI launched Grok Studio, a split-screen workspace that lets users collaborate with Grok on generating documents, code, reports, and browser games. It also launched the ability to create Workspaces that let you organize files and conversations in a single place..While OpenAI and Microsoft have similar tools, Google’s Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building. Google’s tools can edit Docs and Sheets and allow you to chat with Gemini while looking at or editing documents. The difference is that Gemini Workspace only works within Google’s ecosystem..It’s not clear what types of files xAI’s editor might support aside from spreadsheets, or whether xAI plans to build a full productivity suite that could compete with Google Workspace or Microsoft 365..If Owji’s findings are true, the advanced editor would be a step toward Elon Musk’s ambitions to turn X into an “everything app” that includes docs, chat, payments, and social media.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leak-reveals-grok-might-soon-181657484.html,Competitive Risk
57,2025-06-24 00:25:00,Tesla finally began a limited version of long-promised robotaxi service. But there were some bumps,Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi service began in Austin Texas for a select group of the company’s fans.,"Tesla’s much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company’s fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat..It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step..Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet..But the start of the Tesla service Sunday was only a fraction of any of that. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March..But the Austin test pressed on regardless..The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives’ team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday..Ives’ note to clients, which cited how a Tesla “safety monitor” sat in the front passenger seat while no person was in the driver’s seat, praised the quality of the rides taken by his team member..“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.”.But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. In one YouTube video, the robotaxi drove on the wrong side of the road after it attempted and abandoned a left turn, only to continue traveling down the street on the opposite side of a double yellow line before making the left turn on the following block. Fortunately, there were no vehicles driving on the other side of the road.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-finally-began-limited-version-162518514.html,Operational Risk

That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

59,2025-06-23 21:45:00,Baidu vs. Alphabet: Which AI Powerhouse Stock Deserves Your Cash?,Can BIDU compete with GOOGL's AI edge and financial muscle despite its setbacks?,"Baidu BIDU and Alphabet GOOGL share roots in Internet search and have evolved into global AI heavyweights, each riding the wave of generative AI and cloud services. Baidu, China’s dominant search engine, has leveraged its platform to develop and deploy advanced AI models—like ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1—as well as autonomous driving technology through its Apollo initiative. Alphabet, Google’s parent, spans search, advertising, Cloud, YouTube, and hardware, and is spearheading AI progress with Gemini 2.5, AI-powered Cloud services, and TPUs such as Ironwood.The recent surge of interest in generative AI and language models has put companies like Baidu and Alphabet in the spotlight. Google’s rollout of AI features (like its Bard/Gemini AI for search) and Baidu’s launch of its ERNIE Bot (an answer to ChatGPT) underscore how both are racing to monetize AI innovations. Investors are wondering which company is better positioned today for upside. Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu is the unrivaled search leader in China, controlling roughly 60% of China’s search engine market. This core search dominance provides a massive user base and ad platform akin to Google’s in its home market. Beyond search advertising, Baidu has aggressively invested in next-generation tech: its Apollo autonomous driving unit and Apollo Go ride-hailing service are growing (Apollo Go saw a 75% year-over-year increase in rides in first-quarter 2025), and Baidu’s AI Cloud division is booming with 42% revenue growth in the last reported quarter. AI Cloud's non-GAAP operating margin now sits at the level of teens, aided by improved revenue mix and scale efficiencies. The company’s focus on full-stack AI infrastructure and rapid model iteration—most notably the release of ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo—has significantly reduced inference costs while enhancing performance. These improvements make Baidu’s AI Cloud offerings highly cost-competitive, especially as enterprise clients increasingly look to deploy Gen AI applications at scale.Baidu faces several key challenges as it pivots aggressively toward AI. Its online marketing revenue declined 6% year over year, reflecting weakness in its traditional ad business amid a transition to AI-powered search that is not yet fully monetized. While AI-generated content now powers 35% of mobile search results, monetization remains in early testing, putting pressure on near-term revenue and margins. Additionally, Baidu reported negative free cash flow of RMB9.2 billion (excluding iQIYI), driven by rising investments in AI infrastructure, cloud services, and autonomous driving. The company also faces intensifying competition from rivals like Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY in the AI cloud space, while U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips could disrupt its infrastructure scale-up. Although Baidu touts flexibility in chip sourcing and strong GPU utilization, these constraints could still impact efficiency. Moreover, the wide scope of its AI initiatives, from foundation models to digital humans and robotaxis, raises execution risks and may strain resources in the near term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-alphabet-ai-powerhouse-134500273.html,Competitive Risk

Last year, at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Google exec Vidhya Srinivasan remembers a lot of talk about the possibilities of AI in advertising. “People were experimenting with it and thinking about what’s possible,” she recalls. One year later, in the South of France last week, possibility had fully become reality. “It’s actually transforming every aspect of advertising today,” she says..Srinivasan is the person responsible for making much of that transformation happen. At Google, she is VP/GM for both advertising and commerce. She oversees Google Shopping and advertising products across Google Search, maps, YouTube, and more—a vast portfolio of fast-changing products with more than $66.9 billion in revenues in Q1 alone..Srinivasan added commerce to her portfolio at the beginning of this year, a remit she took on as consumers demand hyper-personalization while shopping, and as advertisers seek it as they target shoppers..AI in advertising and commerce can mean wildly different things. It’s a vast portfolio of ad tech products and rapidly AI-generated, targeted advertising. “We’ve always wanted to serve the right ad to the right person at the right time…Now you can come up with a perfect creative at the moment for the person, because the AI is able to generate things on the fly,” she says. “It’s changing the game on what is possible in any given moment.”.It’s also an entirely new shopping experience—a consumer can describe a garment they might want, see an AI-generated version, and then shop for similar products that already exist. “Customer journeys are completely unpredictable,” Srinivasan says. “Users now want a far more relevant, immersive experience in everything they do.”.Adweek last year described Srinivasan as having the “toughest job in advertising.” She’s at the center of a lot of trends: fast-changing activity on Google Search, as more consumers go straight to ChatGPT or other chatbots rather than Google something; advertising anxieties about the future of creative and the industry; and the vast workforce changes that are happening in both sectors..Srnivasan says that her past experience at Amazon Web Services helped prepare her for the challenge. Starting at AWS in 2012, she was tasked with bringing the first cloud data warehouse to market. “The charter was, I should be able to start a data warehouse in the time it takes to get a coffee or buy a book,” she remembers. It seemed impossible at the time. “People were very skeptical that cloud was a real thing when I started there and now, of course, you look back and you’re like, ‘Of course that had to happen.'”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-exec-oversaw-66-9-130243906.html,no risk

I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence..On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights....1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300."".CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power..This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines..And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth..If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.).For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare..Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each..And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI..I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since.

However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083000803.html,Market Risk
69,2025-06-22 06:05:00,Is OpenAI's Deal With Alphabet a Game Changer?,OpenAI just teamed up with Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform.,"For the last couple of years, OpenAI has relied heavily on Microsoft to supply compute power through the Azure cloud platform..Recently, OpenAI has been exploring new cloud partnerships with Oracle and now Google in an effort to migrate away from Microsoft..Teaming up with OpenAI could be a transformative move for Alphabet as its core search business continues to face pressure..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.For more than two years now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company has raised billions in funding from Microsoft, works closely with leading AI-focused cloud providers such as CoreWeave, and is among the key players pushing a $500 billion domestic AI infrastructure initiative called Project Stargate..Recently, OpenAI found itself in the headlines yet again following news of a major partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)..Let's explore how OpenAI and Alphabet are teaming up, and assess why this deal could be a game changer..Microsoft's investment in OpenAI wasn't just about raising capital. As part of their partnership, OpenAI became tightly integrated into Microsoft's cloud service, Azure..While Azure's infrastructure has been key to OpenAI maintaining explosive growth over the last two years, recent moves from the ChatGPT maker suggest it's looking to avoid vendor lock-in with Microsoft..For instance, as part of Project Stargate, Oracle is reportedly exploring purchasing several billion dollars worth of Nvidia's newest Blackwell GPU architecture and leasing access to these chips to OpenAI..According to recent reporting, OpenAI's partnership with Alphabet revolves around the same use case as the Oracle deal: accessing compute power through the Google Cloud Platform. As data workloads continue to rise, training and inferencing AI models becomes increasingly sophisticated and costly. Hence, broadening its cloud compute infrastructure beyond Azure is critical for OpenAI..While cloud computing has emerged as a fast-growing business for Alphabet, Google Cloud operates at a much smaller scale than Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). That said, working with OpenAI may look odd from the outside as the platform could be seen as both a technical competitor and existential threat to Google's search business and AI efforts..However, I think there is a more interesting aspect to this relationship whereby Alphabet is hedging the economic profiles of its various platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-deal-alphabet-game-changer-220500302.html,Operational Risk

Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same. So, which company is better placed to thrive in the future?.Tesla's launch of its full-self-driving (FSD) robotaxi is sometimes seen as a tactical move as its electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share come under pressure in 2025, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that major automakers, including Ford, and leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving, and it's an integral part of the future of the auto industry..The reason behind the investment is a recognition that robotaxis have huge profit potential, not least because they offer a long stream of recurring income from ride-per-mile revenue..Another reality is that EVs are not cheap, and if they are the future of the auto industry, automakers need to make them more affordable. They also need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable..However, don't take my word for it. Here's Ford's CEO Jim Farley in 2019 on autonomous driving and robotaxis: ""The self-driving system is incredibly important to develop, but it's just one part of building a safe and scalable self-driving service that consumers can trust."" Farley went on to outline a timeline for a ""commercial self-driving service"" in 2021, which Ford would fail to achieve..As for affordable EVs, last year, Farley reiterated the need to offer smaller and more affordable EVs to achieve profitability as an EV maker..The two things are strongly connected. You can't have robotaxi EVs if the vehicles aren't affordable. That's a point that resonated during a recent CNBC interview with Waymo, which has a robotaxi service already in place, yet co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana declined to outline a timeline for the company's profitability. Waymo's lack of profitability means its owner, Alphabet, is going to have to invest significant sums, at a loss, if it wants Waymo to build scale. That creates a huge opportunity for a company like Tesla that is just entering the market and potentially offers a much more commercial and scalable service.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-200500011.html,no risk

What are Tesla's competitive advantages in this space? When you explain them to clients, or what do you tell them? .Yeah, it's interesting. I've been in, I've been in Waymos and full self-driving Teslas and and, you know, the first thing that that jumped out to me was that the Tesla system felt more, more natural, right, in the process. Now, the, when you look at the Waymo system, and, you know, this is on the vehicles you see in San Francisco and other cities. Uh, or sounds like they're coming to New York at some point in the not too distant future. They have multiple redundancies in the system, right? They have cameras, they have LiDAR, they have radar and they, they because of those redundancies you know if people look at them and say there there's a higher level of safety. When you look at the, the Tesla system, you know, it's camera based and it's AI based, and they have massive quantities of data uh to do the analysis. Uh, to me the vehicles kind of felt a little more natural, but look but what we tell people is you know the lack of redundancies, the camera-based system only. There are some risks to that. Now, on the positive side, there's really three big benefits. Right, one is cost, right, if you're, if you're talking about a, a robotaxi which you're showing on the screen right now or whether we should talk about a Model Y that I that I subscribed to FSD with, you know the car can be $30 or $40,000. A a Waymo fully equipped with all the sensors, etc. is well north of a hundred thousand dollars. So cost is one. Second is uh, I think clearly the massive fleet of Teslas that are out there right now, which can become part of of a robotaxi fleet over time. But if I have a Tesla Model Y in the driveway and I have a you know full self-driving, you know theoretically I can drive that car to work and dump it into the robotaxi fleet. So the ability to scale based on a massive installed base uh is probably the second uh big positive. And, and then the third is their ability, I think, to have some flexibility whether it's uh, you know, some Tesla owned assets, assets owned by by individuals and even, even you know partnering with at some point or even using a you know me having a Tesla and dumping it into an Uber or or a Lyft fleet if I if I so choose.

Still, the Magnificent Seven group keeps setting the tone for the overall stock market, and most of these stocks are market darlings in 2025, with double-digit price gains over the last 52 weeks..But Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is lagging behind with a 2% price dip over the last year, and the stock looks downright undervalued in many ways. It's the only Magnificent Seven stock I have bought this year, for one simple reason: It's the best combination of affordable shares and unbeatable artificial intelligence (AI) expertise in this elite group..The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running circles around Google Cloud..But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices.

Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive.

Do this instead,"Here are some other, safer ways to verify your identity and sign into your accounts.","Do you receive login security codes for your online accounts via text message? These are the six- or seven-digit numbers sent via SMS that you need to enter along with your password when trying to access your bank accounts, health records, online photos, and more. This type of security is known as multifactor authentication (MFA) and is designed to keep your account secure even if someone knows your password. Without the additional security code, bad actors can’t gain access to your data.

Fortunately, there are other, more secure ways to keep your accounts safe. Here’s why it’s probably a good idea to stop using SMS for your security codes, and what you can use instead..You may think that the text message you receive with the code you need to log into your account is coming from Amazon, Google, Meta, or whoever provides the service you are logging into. But it’s probably not—and therein lies the security risk..Bloomberg and Lighthouse Reports just released an alarming report revealing that some of the most prominent tech companies recommending that users enable multifactor authentication—including Amazon, Google, and Meta—have used third-party companies to send their security codes to users via text..Some of these third-party companies have been linked to institutions in the surveillance industry and even government spy agencies. Additionally, some of the security codes that these third-party companies were responsible for transmitting have been associated with data breaches of individuals’ accounts. Worse: the intermediaries operating in this space do so with little oversight from their tech giant clients or regulators..And Bloomberg and Lighthouse Reports’ piece isn’t the first to warn about the vulnerability that texted security codes expose users to. In December, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning to the public, urging people to migrate away from receiving security codes via text. “Do not use SMS as a second factor for authentication,” the CISA’s memo warned. “SMS messages are not encrypted—a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-security-codes-ask-receive-090000541.html,Operational Risk

The smartphone and computer giant is down around 10% in the last 12 months, while artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are soaring..Management has made some major missteps in virtual reality and false promises with its Siri and Apple Intelligence services. Revenue is growing slowly, and innovation seems to be lacking for this storied technology brand..Is Apple in trouble? Here's why investors should be concerned about owning shares of this stock..Back in early 2024, Apple released the Vision Pro, an expensive virtual reality headset that it promised was the next evolution in computing. The device sold for $3,500 and had a futuristic ski-goggle look and aimed to replace the personal computer for people working at home. Apple has been researching virtual and augmented reality technologies for years, but this was its first large foray into the cutting-edge computing space..Now in June 2025, the Apple Vision Pro looks like a total flop. The company had to scale back production because of weak demand, failed to attract developers to make applications for the device, and has sold fewer than 1 million devices (reportedly) since its launch. Even if it sold 1 million of these devices a year, that equates to $3.5 billion in annual revenue, compared to $400 billion in consolidated revenue for Apple. The device isn't going to move the needle financially..The Vision Pro can officially be called a flop. New versions may change consumer sentiment, but Apple has failed in its first foray into the virtual reality space. This company is still being driven by the iPhone and iPhone software and services..Speaking of smartphones, Apple has promised customers and investors that new AI-focused updates will be coming to Apple devices shortly. Bullish investors see this as a reason for customers to upgrade their iPhones, which has been a nagging issue for the company, as customers are sticking with older devices for longer..As with the Vision Pro, Apple talked a big game around upgrades for Siri and Apple Intelligence products. However, the actual products released have been lackluster..At its annual developer conference, the company delayed the launch of AI Siri to early next year. At the same time, AI competitors, such as Alphabet and OpenAI, are pushing forward with cutting-edge productivity tools, leaving Apple in the dust.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-trouble-083500043.html,Operational Risk

And there's good reason for that. His Baupost Group hedge fund returned an average of 20% per year over the first 30 years of its existence. That performance comes despite value stocks falling well out of favor over the last decade..But Klarman and his team emphasize that they ""remain flexible in their application"" of value investing. That means investing in stocks that are mispriced relative to their value, even if they won't show up on any stock screeners for deep value based on traditional metrics. As a result, this method can end up with some stocks that many investors would consider growth stocks, such as those found in the Magnificent Seven..But Klarman only sees one member of the vaunted group of trillion-dollar stocks as worth his and his investors' money, and he just added more of it to Baupost's portfolio..The Magnificent Seven is a group of stocks full of interesting opportunities for the right investor. And anyone who invested in any or all of them is probably happy with their returns over the last couple of years. But a few may not present the value necessary for an investment from someone like Klarman. As a group, they're relatively expensive based on traditional valuation standards..Four of the seven sport forward P/E ratios above 30, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) with its 168 times multiple. While Tesla could prove worth the price with its plans for a robotaxi service and humanoid robots, there's a lot of risk in buying the stock at its current price, especially as its core car business is facing stiff competition abroad. The other high-priced members are growing quickly and on relatively solid footing, but it's hard to argue they're a bargain at their current prices..But one member of the group trades for a valuation below the S&P 500's average, and that's kind of surprising for a stock with such strong growth potential. The stock has consistently traded at or near the lowest valuation of the Magnificent Seven, giving investors plenty of opportunities. That's why Klarman and his team have built up a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), including adding 652,000 more shares in the first quarter, increasing its stake in the company by 46%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-seth-klarman-holds-just-075500478.html,Concentration Risk

The talks took place before Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that gives it a 49% stake in the data-labeling startup..Meta and Perplexity didn’t respond to requests for comment..Founded in 2022, Perplexity has emerged as one of the most prominent startups using generative AI to rethink core internet services.

Shares of Uber Technologies UBER declined on the news due to concerns of future competition in one of the largest ride-hailing markets in the United States..Waymo has applied for the permit to begin testing its self-driving vehicles in Manhattan. The proposed tests would include a trained human specialist in the vehicle to supervise operations. Regardless of whether the permit is granted, Waymo intends to begin collecting data and evaluating its autonomous driving technology in the city from next month..Alphabet’s Waymo already offers fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services in several major U.S. cities, having achieved significant milestones in the industry. However, Waymo faces substantial regulatory barriers in New York, with current state laws not permitting fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing services..We do not expect Waymo’s move to apply for a testing permit in the densely populated New York City to have much of an adverse impact on Uber’s prospects as feared. Ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft LYFT have successfully navigated complex regulatory relationships with the city. Shares of Lyft also fell on the move by Alphabet’s autonomous driving platform, on concerns about future competition for ride-hailing companies..Uber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. The ride-hailing giant has a partnership with Waymo, too, in this regard. By adopting this approach, Uber has avoided the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. In 2020, Uber sold its self-driving division but retained focus on becoming the ultimate ride-hailing super app..Uber’s dominant market share in the ride-hailing industry also gives it a unique advantage in the lucrative robotaxi market. With its vast network of drivers and customers, Uber can quickly scale autonomous services once the technology matures. Its app is designed to integrate AVs from multiple partners, giving users a variety of options..Lyft is also aiming to be a key player in the lucrative and emerging autonomous vehicle market, highlighting the immense competition in the space. The global robotaxi market is projected to reach $45.7 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 91.8% from 2025 to 2034..Shares of UBER have gained 34.9% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s 9.5% decline in the same timeframe.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-applies-nyc-testing-permit-142800976.html,Competitive Risk

Teleoperation is often used to intervene when a vehicle is unsure of what to do..Alphabet's Waymo, for example, has a team of human ""fleet response"" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver - its bot..""Much like phone-a-friend, when the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information,"" Waymo said in a blog post last year..Former Waymo CEO John Krafcik told Reuters, ""the cars aren't being actively monitored,"" adding that the software is ""the ultimate decision-maker."".A Waymo video shows a car asking a remote operator whether a street with emergency response vehicles is open to traffic. When the human says yes, the vehicle proceeds..In contrast, other companies, such as Baidu's Apollo Go in China, have used fully remote backup drivers who can step in to virtually drive the vehicles. Baidu declined to comment..WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS?.Driving vehicles remotely on public roads has a major potential problem: it relies on cellular data connections that can drop or operate with a lag, disconnecting the vehicle from the remote driver in dangerous situations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-tesla-expected-remotely-control-102154515.html,Operational Risk

The two companies have already partnered in Phoenix, Austin, and soon Atlanta..Analysts led by John Colantuoni note that in Austin, Uber “disclosed the average AV completes more Trips per day than 99% of local drivers,” pointing to the efficiency AVs can deliver on an established platform..“We believe success in these markets demonstrates the long-term value UBER offers to AV developers and could help earn a partnership with Waymo in NYC,” they added..Uber’s deep roots in the city could be a key asset in navigating both regulation and market entry, with Jefferies estimating the company derives a low single-digit percentage of gross bookings from New York..The analysts see Uber as the “most likely consolidator of AV demand,” thanks to its scale and ability to assist AV developers in areas ranging from logistics and pricing to fleet management..Related articles.Uber would be a ’natural strategic partner for Waymo in NYC’: Jefferies.Who are the stock market winners and losers from the Israel-Iran conflict.Stellantis reportedly considering potential sale of luxury brand Maserati",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-natural-strategic-partner-waymo-070528226.html,Operational Risk

Some platform operators had questioned whether a user’s age could be reliably established using current technology..The results of the government-backed trial clear the way for the law to come into force by the end of the year. The findings also potentially allow other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s lead as countries around the world grapple with ways to protect children from harmful content online..“Age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective,” the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial said in a statement Friday announcing its preliminary findings..The trial’s project director, Tony Allen, said there were “no significant technological barriers” to stopping under-16s gaining social media accounts. “These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said..Under the new law, digital platforms including Snapchat, Meta-owned Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches..The trial tested a range of methods and technologies, including facial scans, inferring a user’s age based on their behavior, age verification, as well as parental controls. The tests also took into account the ways teenagers might try to circumvent age checks..“We found a plethora of approaches that fit different use cases in different ways, but we didn’t find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,” the trial said in its statement..More than 50 companies participated in the trial, while Apple Inc. and Google, developers of the most popular mobile-phone operating systems, are also contributing, Allen said on a video conference call on Friday..The trial didn’t assess public acceptance for any particular technology or the costs involved. The accuracy of the different methods, for example the margin of error for facial analysis, wasn’t made available.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-moves-closer-011443922.html,Regulatory Risk

Investors have been jittery about rising AI competition and what it might mean for Google's search ad dominance..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with AMZN..But peel back the headlines, and Google still runs the show. Search remains sticky, really sticky. Even when paid to switch to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, most users went right back to Google, according to a recent Wharton study. It's not just brand loyalty, it's decades of data, personal preferences, and deep integration across products like Maps, YouTube, and Chrome that make switching feel like a downgrade..And while ChatGPT and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) AI are gaining ground, Google's own Gemini platform is catching up fast. It now has 350 million monthly users, skyrocketing from just 9 million last October thanks to rollout across Gmail and Search. Behind the scenes, Alphabet's in-house TPUs give it a serious cost advantage over AI players relying on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) pricey chips..On the numbers side, Alphabet looks solid. Revenue grew 13% over the past 12 months through March, with operating margins climbing to nearly 33%. Google Cloud led the way with 30% growth and major margin gains. The company pulled in nearly $73 billion in free cash flow last year and returned $62 billion via stock buybacks..Spending is ramping up, too, capital expenditures are expected to jump 43% this year to $75 billion, mostly to support AI and cloud infrastructure.

100,2025-06-20 01:36:00,"The Week in AI: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked.""","A new civil war in AI, Andreessen's rant, and Zuck splashes the pot.","Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.""CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA NVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in ""the revolution"" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up after Apple AAPL researchers released their paper ""The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.""We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models ""give up"" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply ""token prediction"" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the ""vibe-coding"" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the ""limitations"" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled ""The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking."" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the ""top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted"" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article ""This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.""And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work ""as fast as possible""...""Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.""Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the ""Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.""I have several posts in the comments of the ""The Week in AI"" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.""Translation: AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: ""The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle."" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled ""The Gentle Singularity.""I call it his ""love letter"" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a ""symbiosis between people and AI"" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of ""post-labor economics"" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the ""not-so-gentle"" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be ""hip.""On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing that Alphabet GOOGL is ""firing on all cylinders across AI"" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last ""search is dead"" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta Platforms META plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be ""mined and modeled"" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough, Advanced Micro Devices AMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...""The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?""It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.""I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer ""thinking."" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other ""intelligence experts"" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line: To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

101,2025-06-19 21:30:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,"Based on the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), Alphabet (GOOGL) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alphabet (GOOGL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 52 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 52 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>.While the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28).

It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)..Alphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 53 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 53 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 41 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.4% and 7.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>.While the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28).

The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies.

Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in..It's true that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity pose a threat to Google Search, but thus far, Google has held its own, continuing to grow..In fact, growth in the business has been steady, and Google Cloud has also turned profitable.

If the claim had been true, it would have meant that Google gained an unfair advantage over its competitors in the digital advertising sector. The unfair advantage was claimed to stem from the design of Google’s platform for buying online advertising..everything possible/Shutterstock.com.This relieves Google of paying up to 8% of its annual revenue from Mexico as a fine.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pushing for a 10-year nationwide ban that would block U.S. states from regulating artificial intelligence. The proposal, already tucked into the House version of Trump's budget bill, is being sold as a way to avoid a messy patchwork of state-level rules that could slow innovation and leave the U.S. trailing China. Their message: keep regulation federal, uniform, and minimalfor now. The lobbying effort is backed by INCOMPAS, a trade group representing tech heavyweights, which launched the AI Competition Center this year to drive home that point. Chip Pickering, INCOMPAS CEO, said the move is about safeguarding America's lead in AI..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN..But not everyone's buying that narrative. Criticsincluding academics, policy analysts, and even some in Silicon Valleyargue this could be less about innovation and more about locking in dominance.

Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian reports the latest on Waymo and VW’s (VWAGY) electric ID. Buzz..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here..Well, Waymo is doing what was once unthinkable, bringing its robo taxi service to the streets of New York City. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian here with more details in the story. I I mean, just personally, I can't wait to get in a Waymo and take it around the city. So is it how quickly is this happening? What's the steps, what are the steps that have to happen? .So, you're saying they apply for a permit to begin tests next month. Now, there'll be a safety driver in the driver seat, so you're not going to be alone in the car, but it should ostensibly drive on its own, like it has in LA, San Francisco, Austin right now. Uh, it should be I mean, I'm I was surprised to hear that they're going to be doing this this soon. I think it's kind of shows you how far the technology's come and how confident they are that they can come to New York City where you have cyclists and pedestrians and just people and you know, bikes everywhere. It's just a kind of a wild scene to think about. But yeah, it's coming here next month and it kind of speaks to their global or their continue expansion, uh more places in LA, more places in San Francisco. So, yeah, this is the next big step for them. .Do we have any line of sight, by the way, I'm just curious, what regulators would have to see, Pras, to get comfortable getting that human out of the car, going full robot? .Yeah, I'm not sure. I believe it's it's that New York does not allow a car to be operated without a driver in the seat. I think it'll kind of maybe show a decent record of safety that'll allow them to change regulations to allow full robo taxi deployment, or as they call unsupervised, uh in in New York. You know, so, as Waymo does this in New York City, Tesla is beginning their robo taxi tests in Austin, but unsupervised, meaning there will be no safety driver in the driver's seat. There'll be a person sitting in the passenger seat and tell operators in case anything needs to be done. So, it's a little bit of a distinction there. A little uh a little odd kind of change, because think about Tesla hasn't proven anything yet from a robo taxi point of view. Where Waymo is being extra careful, uh with that right now. .So you'll get in the car in for the Tesla and somebody will be in the passenger seat already. .In this small test they're doing, yeah. .Interesting. Wasn't there other autonomous tech news today, a Volkswagen backed company? .Yeah, earlier today Volkswagen, uh has this startup called Mio, I think they're called. And basically they came up with this uh, you're looking at it, it's an ID version of their ID Buzz minivan, electric minivan, but but fit for robo taxi use using using um uh different software suite plus sensors, uh plus a sort of bespoke mobility platform that allow operators to buy these vans in bulk and and then then deploy them as robo taxis and Uber will be their partner initially for some parts of the US. So, yeah, this is an interesting concept here. Or it's an actual vehicle that VW is using right now in Hamburg, Germany. And they want to bring it around to the US too. .I like the the paint job on the outside of this. Pras, thank you.

The company announced Wednesday that it has applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation for its vehicles to operate autonomously with a “trained specialist” behind the wheel in Manhattan..Waymo says it does plan to eventually introduce a self-driving service for paid rides in New York City, even if the company doesn’t have a time frame for bringing it to the streets of the nation’s largest and most traffic-ridden city. It called the test “an important step towards one day serving New Yorkers.”.Waymo last deployed its cars in New York in 2021. But that was only a test for data collection and weather testing while a human actually drove the vehicle, the company said..This year’s deployment in the nation’s most congested city will still be a test, but “if the permit is granted, (Waymo) would be (New York City)’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles,” the company said..Shares of Lyft (LYFT) and Uber (UBER) both fell following the announcement..Waymo already provides more than 250,000 paid rides a week without a human driver in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. But it is illegal in New York state to operate a car without a person ready to take control of the vehicle to avoid an accident. Waymo also announced it will begin pushing for a change to that state law.

It plans to soon be in Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC. In addition, Tesla has announced plans to start its own “robotaxi” service in Austin this Sunday, with plans to expand to other cities in the “coming months.” Tesla, however has been promising its widespread robotaxi service was only “a year away” since 2019..Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk insists that providing robotaxi services will produce massive profits and an increased share price for his company. But profitable self-driving car services have thus far remained elusive for other providers..Alphabet does not disclose the financial performance of Waymo. But the segment of the company that includes Waymo reported a $4.1 billion loss last year, even as Alphabet poured in $5.6 billion.

New York's busy streets, with vehicles, pedestrians, bikers, and all sorts of delivery drivers, are seen as one of the most challenging terrains for a rototaxi operator..Waymo's announcement of a future New York City-based service comes amid a planned nationwide expansion. The company operates in parts of San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin, and just announced it was expanding service in greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area..Tesla (TSLA), which is slated to begin its robotaxi testing in Austin starting next week, will not use safety drivers in its cars when its test begins but will have remote teleoperators available. Two Tesla robotaxis were seen testing in Austin last week, but Tesla employees were sitting in the passenger seat..Waymo, the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 trips per week, counts competitors like Zoox (backed by Amazon (AMZN)), China's Pony AI (PONY) and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla, though none operate in as many regions or perform as many autonomous rides as Waymo. Volkswagen's MOIA revealed its ID. Buzz AD robotaxi in Germany this week. However, its vehicles plan to use other operators' platforms, like Uber, to deploy its vehicles..Waymo's expansion counts on its ability to manufacture more vehicles, which the company said will expand to 2,500 vehicles in the near future.

120,2025-06-19 00:59:00,Waymo has set its robotaxi sights on NYC,Waymo said it's working on a return to New York City and its first step it applying for a permit.,"Waymo said Wednesday it has applied for a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the Alphabet company’s first step in a sticky regulatory process to bring its robotaxis to U.S.’s largest city..Waymo applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate its self-driving Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with a human safety operator behind the wheel in Manhattan. New York’s autonomous vehicle demonstration or testing permit requires a human driver to be able to take over; a $5 million insurance policy; and every test vehicle operator must be adequately trained in the safe operation of the test vehicle..New York law is especially prohibitive of autonomous vehicles. While securing a permit would be notable, Waymo is far from being able to launch commercial operations in the city — or even test without a human safety operator behind the wheel..Still, Waymo is pressing forward and said it’s advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel. The company is also trying to build goodwill in NYC and the state by working with several organizations such as MADD NY, YAI, National Federation of the Blind, and the Bronx Community College..Waymo told TechCrunch it has had positive conversations with lawmakers this year and hopes to keep making progress on regulatory changes. New York law states that any person operating a motor vehicle must have at least one hand (or prosthetic) on the steering mechanism at all times. Changing that wording will be key to Waymo eventually being able to deploy driverless vehicles..Other companies have tried to test in NYC before, including Mobileye and the now shuttered Cruise. But these efforts never materialized beyond a few demonstrations or pilots..Of course, New York City has other challenges beyond regulations. The city is chock-a-block with cars, trucks, delivery vans, bicycles, buses, and, importantly, people, all of whom are scuttling about. San Francisco, one of the markets that Waymo operates in today, is also a bustling city with many of the same challenges. NYC takes that complexity to a factor of 10..Waymo has eyed the massive market of NYC for years. In 2021, the company deployed its now retired Chrysler Pacifica minivans — the first self-driving vehicles in its testing fleet — to manually drive and map Manhattan. The company said at the time that each vehicle would have two people, one to drive and another in the passenger seat to help direct the activity of the driver, monitor the software on the vehicle in real time, evaluate the performance, and log comments.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-set-robotaxi-sights-nyc-165904482.html,Operational Risk   Regulatory Risk   Competitive Risk   Strategic Risk

The company expects the plant will create hundreds of jobs in the region as it grows..“The reality is we are just ready,” Zoox Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech on Wednesday. The strategy is to start “putting the capacity in place and then turning it on little by little as we go city by city” with commercial launches, she said..Zoox is one of several companies vying to secure a foothold in the market for autonomous ridehailing. Competitors include Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit and Tesla Inc., which plans to begin offering rides in Austin with no driver behind the wheel as early as Sunday..The Amazon-owned company’s purpose-built robotaxi is akin to a shuttle and has no steering wheel or pedals, with four inward-facing seats. Zoox would need an exemption from US auto safety rules that require vehicles to have driver controls, though the Trump administration has said it’s working on changes to provide those approvals faster..Zoox is “very grateful” to the administration’s work in preparing the US for robotaxis and talks with regulatory bodies are “going well”, Evans said..Zoox is testing or operating robotaxis on a limited basis in San Fransisco and Las Vegas, where it plans to launch its service. Waymo, which uses vehicles made by other automakers that it rigs with self-driving software and sensors, is seen as the market leader and charges fares for rides in multiple US markets..To start, Zoox has a dozen of its robotaxis driving on the Las Vegas Strip, Evans said.

MOIA said its AD MaaS software uses AI to manage fleets in real time and integrates into existing booking apps..In addition, the system meets key regulatory requirements for SAE Level 4 automated vehicles, MOIA said, using additional features like remote supervision and safe handling of emergency interventions on the streets..MOIA’s all-in-one offering — car, self-driving software, and robotaxi platform — comes as Tesla (TSLA) prepares to begin its robotaxi test in Austin in a few days..“Beginning in 2026, we will bring sustainable, autonomous mobility to large-scale deployment in Europe and the US, another milestone on our path to becoming a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen Group CEO, in a statement..VW claims the “MOIA Turnkey Solution” can be implemented by large commercial fleet operators, and the ID. Buzz AD will be deployed on Uber's platform starting next year in Los Angeles..VW believes the ID. Buzz is a strong choice for robotaxi use. It features an extended wheelbase and raised roof for added space, sliding electric doors for ease of entry, four separate seats, and storage space both up front and in the rear..“The ID. Buzz AD is purpose-built for autonomous mobility services. It’s a cabin designed entirely around passenger needs – and the realities of driverless ridepooling or ridehailing,” Christian Senger, CEO of Volkswagen Autonomous Mobility said in a statement to Yahoo Finance..VW and MOIA did not say how much the vehicle would cost when it goes on sale. It is estimated that similar vehicles, like Waymo’s (GOOG) bespoke Jaguar I-PACE, cost upwards of $100,000, though as one of the largest automakers in the world, VW may be able to save money since it owns the ID.

With the new Search Live integration, users can have a free-flowing voice conversation with Search and explore links from across the web..Users will be able to access the feature by opening the Google app and tapping the new “Live” icon to ask their question aloud. They will then hear an AI-generated audio response, and they can follow up with another question..Today’s announcement comes a few weeks after Google rolled out AI Mode to everyone in the U.S. The launch of the feature was seen as Google’s answer to popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. With this new update, Google is looking to take on those services’ respective voice modes..Google says the feature will be useful in instances where you’re on the go or multitasking. For example, if you’re packing for a trip, you can ask a question like “What are some tips for preventing a linen dress from wrinkling in a suitcase?” You could follow up with another question like “What should I do if it still wrinkles?”.As you’re having the conversation, you’ll find links right on your screen if you want to dig deeper into your search..Because Search Live works in the background, you can continue the conversation while in another app. Plus, you have the option to tap the “transcript” button to view the text response and continue to ask questions by typing if you’d like to. You can also revisit a Search Live response by navigating to your AI Mode history..“Behind the scenes, Search Live in AI Mode uses a custom version of Gemini with advanced voice capabilities,” Liza Ma, the director of product management at Google Search, explained in a blog post. “Our custom model is built on Search’s best-in-class quality and information systems, so you still get reliable, helpful responses no matter where or how you’re asking your question.

The ChatGPT maker was already in the process of winding down its reliance on Scale before Meta, an OpenAI competitor, took a 49% stake in the firm, the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data needed to support increasingly advanced artificial intelligence models..OpenAI’s plans inject new uncertainty into Scale’s business in the wake of Meta’s unusual deal. Meta is investing $14.3 billion in Scale and has poached the startup’s chief executive officer, Alexandr Wang, for a new so-called “superintelligence” unit, focused on building a more powerful, and hypothetical, form of AI software. Other Scale employees are expected to follow Wang to Meta to work on AI..A Scale AI spokesperson declined to comment..Founded in 2016, Scale signed up prominent customers, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta and OpenAI, providing them with the data needed to build AI models. However, Meta’s deal with Scale raised concerns that the social-media company may gain new visibility into its rivals’ AI development efforts. Google plans to cut ties with Scale, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.Right after the Meta deal was announced, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar had signaled that the company intended to keep working with Scale. “We don’t want to ice the ecosystem because acquisitions are going to happen,” Friar said at the VivaTech conference in Paris last week.Over the past six to 12 months, however, OpenAI had determined that Scale was not the best fit for it because the AI developer needed more data expertise than Scale could provide, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI has shifted to building more advanced AI models that can mimic the process of human reasoning, as well as agent-like models that can carry out tasks with limited input from users. Forbes previously reported OpenAI had been winding down its Scale work for months.Scale initially focused on working with an army of contractors to do the grunt work of labeling text and images for earlier AI systems. Scale has gradually enlisted better-paid contractors with doctorates, nursing and other advanced degrees to help develop more sophisticated models.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-phasing-scale-ai-following-150114302.html,Strategic Risk

Within its operational zones, Waymo is forecast to achieve 16% penetration overall and 22% in its currently announced markets..Analysts believe rapid Waymo market expansion to 42% of U.S. rideshare markets by 2028 and reaching 5.4% U.S. market penetration, coupled with pricing growth headwinds, caps upside to Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft’s U.S. gross bookings growth..While 30% of Waymo rides are expected to be incremental to the overall market, Wells Fargo anticipates minimal incrementality from additional autonomous vehicle entrants..“Prospects for Uber &  Lyft  to serve as key demand partners for AV suppliers have dimmed recently as Waymo appears thus far to be going it alone in all announced TBD/2026 markets,” the analysts noted..However, they noted that longer term, there may be opportunities for Uber and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to help drive higher utilization of autonomous fleets..Still, Waymo’s expected growth is likely to have material implications for industry leaders Uber and Lyft. By 2030, Wells Fargo forecasts Uber and Lyft will lose 5 and 4 percentage points of market share, respectively..It estimates that 30% of Waymo’s rides will be incremental to the industry, while the remaining 70% will come at the expense of existing players..Pricing trends are also projected to change as the sector matures and becomes more competitive. Wells Fargo projects rideshare pricing will remain flat through 2030, a slowdown from the 3% annual growth seen between 2021 and 2024.

In Silicon Valley, the expansion reaches further into Palo Alto and Menlo Park..Additionally, Waymo is broadening its services in Los Angeles, including Playa del Rey, Ladera Heights, Echo Park, Silver Lake, and the entire stretch of Sunset Boulevard..Although Waymo has the green light to launch services in San Jose, the company has yet to disclose specific plans for the city..Currently, Waymo is the only US firm offering robotaxi services with paying passengers..The company boasts a fleet of over 1,500 vehicles, providing more than 250,000 rides weekly across San Francisco and Los Angeles in California, as well as Phoenix in Arizona and Austin in Texas..Also, in May, Waymo initiated a recall of over 1,200 self-driving vehicles across the US..The recall aims to update software and mitigate collision risks with various roadway barriers.

But here's the good news: The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) offers investors a simple way to buy them all, with a splash of diversification..It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and the Magnificent Seven account for over half of the total value of its entire portfolio. Here's how the ETF could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the next 15 years (or less)..The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which invests in the top 70% of the cumulative market capitalization of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index.

To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the entire value of the 3,537 companies listed on American stock exchanges..It isn't entirely surprising considering the Magnificent Seven stocks have a combined market capitalization of $17 trillion, which they have accumulated by dominating various subsegments of the technology industry including cloud computing, semiconductors, e-commerce, social media, and electric vehicles..As a result, the Magnificent Seven stocks alone represent 56.3% of the total value of the Vanguard ETF's portfolio of 69 stocks:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stocks-could-help-085600953.html,"investment risk: concentration risk, market risk"

It will cap off a spectacular run of success that dates back to 1965 -- though his journey isn't over completely, because he will continue to serve as chairman of Berkshire's board..Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock when Buffett took the helm 60 years ago and held on for that entire time, you'd have been sitting on shares worth an eye-popping $44.7 million at the end of 2024. The same investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period. Part of that growth came from the dozens of businesses that the conglomerate purchased in their entirety over the years, but the rest was driven by the incredible stock-picking of Buffett and his team..Buffett uses a simple strategy, and as a general rule, he tends to avoid buying shares of companies whose businesses he doesn't understand. As a result, he doesn't invest in technology stocks very often, and he certainly doesn't chase hot trends like artificial intelligence (AI)..However, there is one AI stock that could be a great fit in Berkshire's portfolio because it meets most of Buffett's investment criteria, and he has even expressed regret for not investing in it during its early years..Buffett is a value investor who likes to buy good companies when they are trading cheap, but he doesn't shy away from picking up shares of spectacular companies at a fair price..When considering a potential investment, Buffett looks for companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams. He also likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback programs. But time is Buffett's most important weapon because compound growth amplifies his results over the long term -- he has often been quoted as saying his preferred holding period is forever..Buffett oversees numerous wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, including Duracell, Dairy Queen, and GEICO Insurance. But he also helps manage its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, which currently includes holdings in 38 companies and is worth around $278 billion today.

When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L).

Back in April, Meta Platforms (META) delivered a blockbuster Q1, with a $42.32 billion revenue haul, up 16%, driven by AI-powered ad growth. The momentum seems to be going strong throughout Q2, with Meta recently announcing a $14.3 billion investment for a 49% stake in Scale AI, which will further solidify its leadership in the space. Meta also wants to have Scale CEO Alexandr Wang, spearhead a superintelligence lab. Let’s unpack why this deal could be transformative for Meta..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.Meta is experiencing strong momentum in the AI space. In Q1, the company reported a 5% increase in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad pricing, driven by enhanced targeting capabilities across Reels and Stories on Instagram and Facebook, which now serve a combined 3.43 billion daily active users. Meta AI, positioned as a competitor to ChatGPT, is approaching one billion monthly users and is already powering personalized content feeds and early-stage trials of AI-integrated smart glasses, highlighting Meta’s unparalleled global reach..The potential addition of Scale AI, a leading data-labeling company valued at $29 billion, could further accelerate Meta’s AI innovation. Scale AI generated $870 million in revenue last year and is on track to reach $2 billion this year, underscoring its significant role in refining machine learning models. When added to META’s revenues, Scale appears value accretive..Scale’s capabilities could directly support Meta’s AI infrastructure and enhance applications like WhatsApp Business, which now serves over 100 million businesses and is expected to become a key driver of revenue growth as AI-driven customer engagement tools gain traction. For instance, AI-powered chatbots that anticipate customer needs could help small businesses drive sales. Additionally, Scale’s data assets might elevate Meta’s Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, enabling advanced features such as real-time translation or navigation that could rival offerings from competitors like Google’s Gemini..The decision to acquire a 49% non-voting stake in Scale AI appears to be a strategic move, particularly in an environment where regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech remains intense. Meta’s prior acquisitions—such as Instagram and WhatsApp—continue to attract attention from antitrust authorities, and a full acquisition of Scale could have raised similar concerns. By allowing Scale to operate independently, Meta avoids potential antitrust issues while still gaining access to the company’s talent, led by CEO Alexandr Wang, and its valuable data infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-bets-14-230500025.html,Strategic Risk   Capital Allocation Risk   Technology Risk   Execution Risk

This can cause the AI’s performance to experience “qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability,” according to the report..AI benchmarking — or, the process of comparing the performance of different AI models — is a dubious art that often provides little context for the actual capabilities of a given model. But some researchers think that studying how AI models play video games could be useful (or, at the very least, kind of funny)..Over the last several months, two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic have set up respective Twitch streams called “Gemini Plays Pokémon” and “Claude Plays Pokémon,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago..Each stream displays the AI’s “reasoning” process — or, a natural language translation of how the AI evaluates a problem and arrives at a response — giving us insight into the way that these models work..While the progress of these AI models is impressive, they are still not very good at playing Pokémon. It takes hundreds of hours for Gemini to reason through a game that a child could complete in exponentially less time..What’s interesting about watching an AI navigate a Pokémon game is not so much about its time of completion, but rather how it behaves along the way..“Over the course of the playthrough, Gemini 2.5 Pro gets into various situations which cause the model to simulate ‘panic,'” the report says..This state of “panic” can result in the model’s performance getting worse, as the AI may suddenly stop using certain tools at its disposal for a stretch of gameplay. While AI does not think or experience emotion, its actions mimic the way in which a human might make poor, hasty decisions when under stress — a fascinating, yet unsettling response..“This behavior has occurred in enough separate instances that the members of the Twitch chat have actively noticed when it is occurring,” the report says..Claude has also exhibited some curious behaviors in its journeys across Kanto. In one instance, the AI picked up on the pattern that when all of its Pokémon run out of health, the player character will “white out” and return to a Pokémon Center.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-gemini-panicked-playing-pok-205319439.html,No risk

The company's increasing litigation issues are a concern. Intensifying competition from Microsoft and Amazon in cloud computing is a headwind.Nevertheless, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions. The company expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.Alphabet's dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)IBM's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+68.5% vs. +1.2%). The company is likely to benefit from heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management.A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and investments in growth opportunities will likely boost profitability. IBM is betting big on the watsonx platform, which is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Strategic acquisitions to boost portfolio is a positive.However, buyouts have negatively impacted the company's balance sheet in the form of high level of goodwill and net intangible assets. IBM's Consulting business is affected soft demand in some end markets and macroeconomic headwinds. A high debt burden remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>>)Shares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+42.4% vs. +16.2%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products, from the Pentagon and its foreign allies. This resulted in RTX registering a robust defense backlog of $92 billion as of March 31, 2025.Steadily improving commercial air traffic worldwide has also been boosting the company's sales. The company also holds a solid solvency position, at least in the short term.However, the uncertainties created by the recent imposition of U.S. government-issued import tariffs and the counter-tariffs from other nations pose a risk for RTX. Supply-chain challenges continue to affect the aerospace sector, which may adversely affect RTX's performance. The stock's forward 12-month EV/SALES ratio is unimpressive when compared to its industry.(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)National Presto Industries' shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+31% vs. +6.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $680.92 million is strategically positioned to capitalize on rising U.S. defense spending and global geopolitical tensions. Its Defense segment, aligned with key Department of Defense priorities such as Ukraine resupply and autonomous systems, benefits from a growing $1.2 billion contract backlog extending through 2029, supporting long-term revenue visibility.Vertically integrated operations enhance quality and cost control, solidifying its role as a sole-source contractor on several 40mm systems. Q1 2025 results show robust earnings growth driven by a 47% sales surge in Defense. Recent investments, including a $19.8 million logistics facility, bolster operational resilience in its Housewares segment.However, risks remain, such as heavy reliance on DoD contracts, tariff-driven margin pressures in Housewares, a cybersecurity breach, and continued underperformance in the Safety segment.(You can read the full research report on National Presto Industries here >>>)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-alphabet-140600952.html,No risk

(ORCL) investors find themselves at a pivotal crossroads. Either heed the warning from a growing list of indicators that suggest the stock has run up too far, too fast — or continue to chase another rally that’s been supercharged by lofty artificial intelligence expectations..Most Read from Bloomberg.Security Concerns Hit Some of the World’s ‘Most Livable Cities’.As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space.As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage.How E-Scooters Conquered (Most of) Europe.Shares of the software maker have soared 75% from April’s low, including their best two-day gain since 2001 after its earnings report last week showed AI-fueled revenue growth is gaining steam. However, that’s left the stock trading at it most overbought level in 25 years and at its steepest valuation in more than two decades. And there are signs investors may already be balking..Oracle shares fell nearly 1% in premarket trading Tuesday as the Israel-Iran conflict drags on. That follows a nearly 2% decline on Monday, a day that saw the broader Nasdaq 100 Index rally 1.4%..Last week’s $116 billion rally has shifted the focus to Oracle’s execution, according to Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. Its growth opportunity from AI reminds Morgan of Microsoft Corp.’s push into cloud computing in the last decade or even Nvidia Corp.’s data center business in 2023..“That could end up being too optimistic, but I think Oracle is in its teenager phase, not yet mature,” Morgan said. “We could maybe look back on this quarter as the moment we all realized how much more there is to come.”.Oracle is best known for its database software but has been investing aggressively in its cloud-computing business. That spending appears to be paying off as the company predicted “dramatically higher” revenue growth for its upcoming fiscal year amid strong demand for AI-related services..Analysts expect that growth rate to be about 16%, up from 8.4% in fiscal 2025, which ended last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income, meanwhile, is expected to rise 15% in fiscal 2026, and expansion in both metrics is projected to accelerate in fiscal 2027..While Oracle’s market share within cloud computing remains below that of bigger players like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), the results were the latest example of the company’s growing strength in AI.

151,2025-06-17 18:00:00,"Junk Science Week — Terence Corcoran: When science turns political, trust declines","The junk is not necessarily in the science, but in the ideological streams through which the science flows","For many years now, popular trust in science has been in decline. That conclusion may not pass a rigid science review since most of the evidence comes from polling, which — according to Google’s AI review — lacks scientific rigidity. When asked whether polling is a science, Google AI responded with what looks like a consensus view: “It is both a science and an art.” The science involves using “statistical methods, sampling techniques and social science principles to design and conduct polls that accurately reflect public opinion.” Then comes a big cloud of doubt: “However, the interpretation and application of polling data, as well as the specific strategies used by pollsters, can involve a degree of artistry and political judgment.” Some say polling is “more an art than a science.”.The following is not intended as a put-down of polling, which has its valid processes and uses. The summary definition of polling, however, does somewhat correspond to FP Comment’s standard definition of junk science. Junk science occurs when scientific facts are distorted, risk is exaggerated (or underplayed) and “the science” adapted and warped by politics and ideology to serve another agenda. That definition encompasses a wide range of activities among scientists, NGOs, politicians, journalists, media outlets, cranks and quacks who manipulate science for political, environmental, economic and social purposes. We can now add Artificial Intelligence to the list..The large proportion of science that flows through to the populations of Canada and all countries can, unfortunately, fall into our definition. The array of ideological forces using science to generate public support for social and political causes — or to defeat the same causes — is sowing increasing confusion and distrust..In recent years, poll after poll after poll has produced evidence that public confidence in science has been declining. Back in 2020, University of Alberta professor Tim Caulfield noted that fomenting distrust “has become the go-to strategy for selling health products, generating clicks and getting elected.” The doubts grew as the COVID-19 pandemic raged and as Donald Trump and others on both sides of the political fence engaged in pitched battles over vaccines..The pandemic is said to be a major factor behind the decline of trust in science, especially in the United States where vaccine polarization accelerated with Trump’s appointment of Robert Kennedy Jr. as America’s Secretary of Health, which fuelled more doubt (or so the polls showed), especially on the religious right.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/junk-science-week-terence-corcoran-100027248.html,Reputational Risk

When it comes to cloud computing, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has long been an afterthought to the big three players in the space: Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.","Oracle shares climbed higher as investors cheered the company's strong forecast..The company's cloud computing unit is showing outsized growth, which is only expected to accelerate, making it a major player in the space..Oracle is shifting from a value stock to a growth stock..10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›.When it comes to cloud computing, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has long been an afterthought to the big three players in the space: Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, Oracle is starting to make some noise in the segment and is putting up stats that suggest it is now the fastest grower in the space..Let's delve into Oracle's fiscal Q4 results to see how cloud computing is powering its results and what it means for investors moving forward..While Oracle saw its cloud infrastructure (OCI) revenue soar 52% year over year in its fiscal 2025 Q4 to $3 billion, what got investors excited was the company's forecast that its cloud infrastructure revenue would soar by more than 70% in fiscal 2026. Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison boasted that the company will ""build and operate more cloud infrastructure data centers than all of [its] cloud infrastructure competitors combined."".The company pointed to its strong remaining performance obligations (RPO) as a reason for the confidence in its growth outlook, noting that most of these contracts are non-cancellable. In the quarter, RPO jumped 41% to a whopping $138 billion. It said cloud RPO climbed 56% and is now nearly 80% of its total RPO. More importantly, it is looking for about a third of the RPO to be recognized as revenue over the next year..Oracle said that demand for its OCI services continues to ""dramatically"" outpace supply, with consumption revenue soaring 62% year over year. As such, it plans to increase its capital expenditures (capex) to more than $25 billion in fiscal 2026 to help meet increasing demand. It said most of this spending will be on revenue-generating equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings..The company also highlighted the strength of its cloud database services, which saw revenue climb 31% year over year, and its autonomous database, which saw consumption revenue surge 47%. It said that its database service being accessible across multiple cloud providers gives it a competitive advantage in the market..For its fiscal 2025 Q4 ended May 31, Oracle's overall revenue rose 11% year over year to $15.9 billion, which handily topped the $15.6 billion analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG. Cloud revenue increased 27% year over year to $6.7 billion. Within the cloud segment, cloud infrastructure revenue surged 52% to $3 billion, as mentioned above, while cloud application revenue increased 12% to $3.7 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-pops-company-shows-080000947.html,Strategic Risk

Fraud related to the Indian government’s instant payment system UPI grew 85% year-over-year to nearly 11 billion Indian rupees ($127 million) last year, per the government’s data. India also saw several instances of digital arrest scams, where fraudsters pose as officials to extort money via video calls and predatory loan apps..With its Safety Charter, Google aims to address some of these areas. The company has also launched its security engineering center in India, its fourth center after Dublin, Munich, and Malaga..Announced at the Google for India summit last year, the security engineering center (GSec) will allow Google to partner with the local community, including government, academia and students, and small and medium enterprises to create solutions to solve cybersecurity, privacy, safety, and AI problems, said Google VP of security engineering Heather Adkins in an interview with TechCrunch..Google has partnered with the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to raise awareness of cybercrimes, the company said in a blog post. This builds upon the company’s existing work, including the launch of its online fraud identification program, DigiKavach, which debuted in 2023 to restrict the harmful effects of malicious financial apps and predatory loan apps..With its GSec in India, Google will focus on three key areas, Adkins told TechCrunch: the phenomenon of online scams and fraud and how people are safe online; the cybersecurity of enterprises, government, and critical infrastructure; and building responsible AI..“These three areas will become part of our safety charter for India, and over the coming years… we want to use the fact that we have engineering capability here to solve for what’s happening in India, close to where the users are,” said Adkins..Globally, Google is utilizing AI to combat online scams and remove millions of ads and ad accounts. The company aims to deploy AI more extensively in India to combat digital fraud..Google Messages, which comes preinstalled on many Android devices, uses AI-powered Scam Detection that has helped protect users from over 500 million suspicious messages a month. Similarly, Google piloted its Play Protect in India last year, which it claims has blocked nearly 60 million attempts to install high-risk apps, resulting in the stopping of more than 220,000 unique apps on over 13 million devices. Google Pay, which is one of the top UPI-based payment apps in the country, also displayed 41 million warnings against transactions suspected to be potential scams.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-scale-ai-powered-fraud-070100010.html,Operational Risk

It’s essentially the layers of human feedback that help train AI to evolve and make smarter, safer, more useful choices..💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵.In true tech fashion, though, AI’s human-in-the-loop (HITL) pipelines are turning into a slugfest. At the heart of this showdown is Scale AI, perhaps one of the leading names in the niche..However, that premium position is now under duress with two of the biggest tech giants, Google and Meta Platforms  (META) , at the center of it all..In the latest twist, Google is stepping back while Meta ramps up its role with Scale AI, with the broader narrative of Big Tech guarding its training data like gold..Since its founding in 2016, Scale AI has become one of the key players in fine-tuning the most advanced AI models. Specifically, it delivers the high-fidelity labels needed for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)..Related: Meta commits absurd money to top Google, Microsoft in critical race.Simply put, it’s how humans guide AI by giving feedback so it learns to make better choices..AI bellwethers like OpenAI and Google  (GOOGL)  have leaned on these human-verified datasets, a role OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar recently deemed “critical” in maintaining a healthy AI ecosystem..Naturally, investors took notice..A $100 million boost from Founders Fund in 2019 helped Scale jump past billion-dollar unicorn status. From there, it was off to the races as by 2021, a $325 million Series E had the company valued at a whopping $7.3 billion..Things kicked up a gear in May last year when Accel led a $1 billion round, pushing Scale’s valuation to an eye-watering $13.8 billion with Tiger Global, Index Ventures, and Nvidia all back for more..Now, Meta Platforms, one of the largest spenders on AI, has acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion, valuing the company at nearly $30 billion..The decision risks Scale’s once-enviable positioning by questioning its neutrality, though, with Google, Microsoft, and others retooling their contracts to avoid giving a rival a peek at their playbooks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-plans-major-ai-shift-023300884.html,Competitive Risk

It seems that every week, there's a new development happening in the space. This further drives excitement from industry participants and observers. .It's becoming more difficult to argue that AI is just hype. Businesses are investing billions of dollars to position themselves to become AI leaders. Users are finding the various apps to be valuable tools to boost productivity and efficiency..From an investing perspective, it's time to put money to work. Here are two top AI stocks to buy right now..One AI stock to consider adding to your portfolio is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The company just announced a partnership with OpenAI that would make Alphabet's Google Cloud a computing provider for the ChatGPT creator.. Before this, Alphabet announced plans to purchase cloud security company Wiz for $32 billion, in an effort to bolster its security capabilities in an AI era..The other AI stock to purchase today is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Like Alphabet, this business isn't shying away from trying to strike deals of its own. It is reportedly ready to invest $14 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data labeling company..And looking ahead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to keep his foot on Meta's gas pedal. He's trying to put together a team of experts to create AI superintelligence. Scale AI's founder and CEO Alexandr Wang will be on this elite team..Another key reason why both of these dominant businesses are top AI plays is because they have virtually limitless financial resources to push forward. Combined, they had $166 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on their balance sheets as of March 31..Investors know Alphabet and Meta as two powerful tech enterprises. The former owns some of the most widely used internet properties, like Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. The latter runs insanely popular social media apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Both companies have billions of users, giving them unrivaled reach..However, it's not a shock that AI is management's top priority these days. For Alphabet, this means making its crown-jewel search engine more useful. The AI Overviews feature was officially released over a year ago, and it's now being monetized at about the same rate as traditional Search. Perhaps the fears about the search engine market being completely disrupted by AI were overblown.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-000000144.html,no risk

159,2025-06-17 04:00:00,Why Alphabet's AI Infrastructure Makes Today's Price a Bargain,Alphabet's Vertical Integration and Growth Engines Justify a Re-Rating,"So far in 2025, Alphabet (Google) has been the worst performer among the Mag 7, with the stock down about 11% YTD. Since February, I've watched the share price drop hard from around $207 to $141 before bouncing back to about $170 today. While the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, Google has barely clawed back a third of what it lost, which really highlights just how much it's lagging behind the broader market..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with JYD..GOOG Data by GuruFocus.Sure, the broader macro environment has played a role, but I think investors have mostly been spooked by bigger issues like rising fear around AI disrupting Google Search, the antitrust drama in the U.S. about its ad dominance, and newer players like DeepSeek stirring up competitive pressure. On top of that, there's a lot of debate over whether Google is spending too much on AI. Even with all this noise, I personally think Google looks quite attractive here. The company is still growing its revenue at double-digit rates, margins are improving, free cash flow is strong, and the shareholder return is nothing to ignore around 4% annually when you add in buybacks and dividends. At about $170 per share, I see Google as a rare combo of a solid growth business trading at a pretty reasonable price, and in this market, that's not easy to find..One thing that really stands out about Google is how it controls nearly everything in-house. Unlike other AI companies, Google doesn't need to rely on third-party infrastructure. It already has an extensive global network of data centers built out over years to power search, and now it's doubling down by building more of them to support AI. This is a big deal because OpenAI, for example, doesn't have the ability to build these data centers by itself, which is why it's closely partnered with Microsoft..While Microsoft can match Google in terms of investment power, it still relies on OpenAI for models like ChatGPT. That creates a different kind of setup compared to Google's tighter integration between its models (like Gemini) and its own infrastructure. I think this gives Google a real edge when it comes to competing in AI, because it owns the entire tech stack and has direct access to the world's largest information index. It also means Gemini can scale more efficiently and deliver better performance long term since everything runs within Google's own systems. From my point of view, this is a big strategic advantage that I don't think gets enough attention.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-alphabets-ai-infrastructure-makes-200048235.html,market risk

We decided if we were going to negotiate, we were going to opt in. We want to be part of this technology,"" she explained..Time has pressed forward with a major reinvention under Sibley, partly by leaning into AI..In 2024, it signed a multiyear deal with OpenAI to give it access to Time's 102-year-old content archive..More recently, the company said it'll launch an on-demand podcast with Meta (META)-backed Scale AI that features two AI hosts summarizing four top stories from its newsletter The Brief..Sibley said the company has been leveraging AI across ""every single department"" to become more efficient, from the newsroom to legal and HR. The push for cost savings comes as Time laid off around 30 staffers in January 2024 and another 22 last August. Sibley cited industry headwinds at the time for the cuts..In the fall, Time expects to enable multilingual, personalized AI interactions on the site, such as AI search, chat, and translation..""The acceleration of how consumers are demanding finding ways of personalized content, multimodal content, and with the AI answer results, we wanted to again embrace it and be part of it as opposed to litigate,"" Sibley said..Time was purchased from Meredith Corporation in September 2018 by Salesforce (CRM) co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, for $190 million in cash. Sibley began as its CEO in November 2022, joining the magazine from Forbes, where she was COO. Prior to Forbes, she held leadership positions at Condé Nast and Bloomberg BusinessWeek..The publication has also expanded its high-profile events business and modernized its tech stack while continuing with its high-quality journalism..To that end, Time named Donald Trump ""Person of the Year"" for 2024 and followed up with a headline-making interview with the president to mark his first 100 days in office..Sibley said in a recent note that Time is forecasting 24% advertising revenue growth in the first half of the year..Other media players are navigating the tricky balance between negotiating and litigating against AI.

However, Tesla has significant advantages in terms of cost, scalability, and autonomous technology. Can Elon Musk and his team catch up?","Over the past year, EV-pioneer Tesla (TSLA) has got the proverbial “kitchen sink” thrown at it with a plethora of reputational issues and controversies, soft car sales, tariff impacts, and missed deadlines. Some of the problems that the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has faced include:.Elon Musk Reputation: Earlier this year, Tesla faced boycotts and vandalism from the left after CEO Elon Musk became embroiled in political backlash due to his political work under the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) cut government programs like US AID. More recently, Musk faced backlash from the right after getting into a social media spat with President Trump over the “Big Beautiful Bill.” (Musk and Trump have since made amends)..Sales Slump: Tesla sales have fallen across key markets like Europe and China over the past few years while profit margins have declined. Meanwhile, tariff uncertainty has disrupted the Tesla supply chain, threatening to impact gross margins further negatively..Intense Competition: Tesla faces competition from subsidized Chinese competitors like Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO), and BYD (BYDDY), among others..Despite the many challenges Elon Musk and Tesla have had to overcome, the TSLA shares are up about 75% over the past twelve months, trouncing the S&P 500’s 9.3% gains..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The reason for the robust performance is that investors are beginning to discount the Tesla’s long-awaited and delayed Tesla Robotaxi. But are investors suffering from “hopium,” or are they justified in doing so?.Earlier this month, the first driverless Tesla Model Y Robotaxi was spotted in Austin, Texas, the home of CEO Elon Musk. Officially, Musk and the team plan to conduct a limited launch “tentatively” on June 22. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo Robotaxi service has the first-mover advantage over Tesla. Waymo has already launched its geofenced service across several US cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin..With Waymo conducting approximately a quarter million paid Robotaxi rides per week, it’s easy for investors to get lulled into the notion that Waymo will dominate the Robotaxi market. However, Tesla has three distinct advantages, including:.Robotaxi Cost: Unlike Tesla, which mostly relies on AI and cameras for its “Full Self-Driving” capabilities, Waymo relies on expensive lidar technology. In fact, Tesla’s autonomous vehicle cost is ~85% lower than Waymo’s, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence Analysis..Robotaxi Scalability: Waymo aims to manufacture 2,000 Waymo vehicles over the next year. In contrast, Tesla currently produces roughly one million Model Y, FSD-capable vehicles per year. In a recent video, internet personality Farzad Mesbahi explained that “Tesla can manufacture the same amount of Robotaxis that Waymos is looking to manufacture over the next year in about five hours.” .Autonomous Technology: Bloomberg technologyhost Ed Ludlow says, “Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD) technology, while classified as Level 2 like most other vehicles offering autonomous features, could be closer to reaching full autonomy than peers. Tesla’s manufacturing capability is a core differentiator vs Waymo, who faces vehicle production constraints. No other incumbent US or European carmaker offers full self-driving capabilities on city roads.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-dream-just-hopium-185000458.html,Competitive Risk

Earlier, the company said it would begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service..Meta’s rally has coincided with a resurgence in trader appetites for AI-related stocks, after the earnings season alleviated fears that Big Tech companies might rein in spending on expensive computing gear. The rebound marks a shift from earlier in the year, when stocks such as Nvidia Corp. tumbled on concerns about AI models developed on the cheap in China..An exchange traded fund that tracks AI stocks including Amazon.com Inc. is up 32% from a low on April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on trading partners, sparking a broad relief rally in stocks.

He also cited improved operational efficiencies and the shift away from the so-called metaverse, which prompted the company to change its name from Facebook in 2021..“Using AI to optimize the data it has on users for revenue is a clear application, one that allows Meta to play offense while Alphabet is playing defense,” Bond said, referring to concerns that the Google parent could lose market share in the lucrative search business to AI services like ChatGPT. “While AI is expensive, there is good evidence that it is really paying off so far.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-cheer-zuckerberg-doubles-101644156.html,Strategic Risk
166,2025-06-16 21:30:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Lead the Next Tech Bull Market,Cloud computing and semiconductor stocks have been at the forefront of the tech bull market throughout the AI revolution.,"For the last few years, the most popular AI stocks were chip companies and cloud hyperscalers..However, infrastructure services are beginning to emerge as a new opportunity in the AI realm..Oracle provides critical cloud-based infrastructure services and sees robust growth ahead..10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›.For much of the last two years, a small concentration of mega-cap artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have played a major role in sending the stock market to new highs. Among the biggest winners were Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms..Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are considered the industry gold standard for generative AI hardware, and cloud hyperscalers and others in big tech just couldn't stop buying these pricey chipsets. While GPUs are still very much in demand, I think a new chapter is quietly unfolding within the broader AI storyline..Let's explore why the AI opportunity is more than just chips. From there, I'll go into detail about why I see Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) as a breakout candidate to lead the next bull market..When the AI revolution kicked off about two-and-a-half years ago, Nvidia was the default option when it came to purchasing GPUs. But over the last couple of years, competition has started to creep into the semiconductor market..Advanced Micro Devices is Nvidia's most direct rival in the AI data center market. However, all the cloud hyperscalers that I referenced above are also investing heavily into custom silicon in an effort to migrate from an AI architecture that's entirely built on Nvidia's backbone..In my view, GPUs aren't becoming less important by any means. However, with the introduction of so many new chips, I do think the semiconductor landscape is becoming commoditized. At this point, AI developers know that they need to keep buying chips. I think the bigger use case for these companies is becoming rooted in figuring out how to manage these GPU clusters amid ongoing AI infrastructure buildouts..This is where Oracle identified an opportunity early on, and the company's results are starting to show a clear pattern..On June 11, Oracle reported earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full 2025 year (ended May 31). For the year, Oracle generated $57.4 billion in revenue -- an increase of 8% year over year. I understand that this growth rate pales in comparison to Nvidia and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-133000808.html,speculative risk

168,2025-06-16 19:50:00,Term Sheet Next: How Facebook’s former chief revenue officer is coaching the next generation of startup founders,Why 01 Advisors partner David Fischer went from Google and Facebook to venture investor.,"Every venture investor tells their portfolio companies that they’re more than just a check. They help with introductions, they help with recruiting, and they help with going public. Some have even been operators themselves and encountered the same problems as their startup founders. But how many full-time VCs can boast that they helped build the biggest tech companies in the world?.There’s Marc Andreessen, of course, and Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla. David Fischer, a partner at 01 Advisors, may not yet have the same name recognition, though he served as a vice president of sales at Google and then chief revenue officer at Facebook as both companies burst out of the stratosphere. And for founders hoping to scale their companies from zero to one in this era of hyper-speed, Fischer’s background may make him as valuable as the giants of Sand Hill Road..I met with Fischer this spring in 01A’s New York office, which is in the same Lower Manhattan building that houses Union Square Ventures and Inspired Capital. Even before Fischer joined the VC ranks during the pandemic, he took a circuitous route into tech. He worked briefly as a journalist before a stint at the Treasury Department for Larry Summers, which is where he met his future boss at Google and Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg. (Fischer’s father, the famed economist and central banker Stanley Fischer, recently passed away.).After attending Stanford Business School, Fischer entered Silicon Valley at a transformative time for the tech sector, joining Google in 2002 right after it launched AdWords and was beginning to bring in revenue. He spent eight years at the search giant before Facebook hired him to pull off the same feat. When Fischer started, Facebook had about 1,200 employees, $750 million in revenue, and had yet to wade into mobile. Its acquisition of Instagram and IPO were still two years away. “Ads were a little bit of an afterthought,” Fischer tells me. When he left in 2021, Facebook’s revenue had topped $100 billion..So, where do you go next? Fischer may not have been in the first 10 or 100 employees at either tech behemoth, but he had experienced the addictive period when a company goes from product-market fit to market domination—and in the case of Google and Facebook, world domination. “I always like to take what I’ve learned before and bring it to do something real and rewarding,” Fischer says..He began to channel that into investing, first as an angel and then connecting with two friends who had started their own firm. Fischer isn’t the only former operator at 01A—the firm was founded by former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, as well as Fischer’s one-time counterpart at Twitter in the CRO role, Adam Bain. Fischer joined full-time for 01A’s third fund, a $395 million vehicle it launched in October 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/term-sheet-next-facebook-former-115039212.html,No risk

Friar emphasized the importance of maintaining a diverse vendor ecosystem to support AI development. Meanwhile, Scale’s other key customers like Google, Microsoft, and xAI are reportedly looking to distance themselves from the startup..OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, says the company plans to continue working with Scale AI despite the startup’s recent multi-billion-dollar partnership with rival Meta..“We don’t just buy from Scale,” Friar said at the Viva Technology conference in Paris. “We work with many vendors on the data front.”.“As models have gotten smarter, you’re going into a place where you need real expertise…we have academics and experts telling us that they are finding novel things in their space,” she said. “We don’t want to ice the ecosystem, because acquisitions are going to happen and I think if we ice each other out, I think we’re actually going to slow the pace of innovation.”.Founded in 2016, Scale AI supplies large volumes of labeled and curated training data and works with several major AI companies including Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. On Thursday, Meta announced it was investing $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the startup—a major move for Meta’s AI capabilities but one that reportedly made some of the Big Tech’s competitors wary of using Scale’s services..Scale intends to keep operating as an independent business but with deeper commercial ties to Meta. The company’s CEO Alexandr Wang will also join Meta’s team working on “superintelligence” and be replaced by Jason Droege as interim CEO. Wang will remain on Scale’s board and said in a note to employees he would poach a few “Scalien” employees to take with him to Meta, but did not identify them directly..Scale’s largest customer, Google, reportedly plans to cut ties with the AI data-labeling startup in the wake of the Meta deal. According to a report from Reuters, the tech giant has already held conversations with some of Scale’s rivals to shift much of the workload, representing a significant loss of business for the startup now valued at $29 billion. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment made by Fortune..Microsoft and Elon Musk’s xAI also reportedly looking to pull back from Scale after the high-profile deal, and despite Friar’s comments, OpenAI reportedly made a similar decision to pull back on some of its business with the startup several months ago.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-plans-continue-working-scale-112152230.html,Competitive risk

These annotations, costing up to $100 each, are vital for generative AI developers..Scale also serves self-driving car companies and the US government, which are expected to remain clients..Meta’s stake has raised concerns among AI developers, who fear sharing proprietary data with Scale could expose their strategies to a rival, said Reuters..Scale’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, and select employees will transition to Meta, where Wang will lead AI efforts..The Meta deal will benefit Scale AI’s investors, including Accel and Index Ventures, and its employees..""Google to terminate Scale AI partnership"" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand... .The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Now options traders are signaling that they see the pricey cohort as especially vulnerable to another round of trade war-driven volatility..Most Read from Bloomberg.As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space.As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage.The cost of protecting against a correction in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, is climbing with less than a month to go until Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs potentially ends. On Friday, the relative price of hedging against a 10% decline in the ETF, compared with a similar rally, hit its highest level since early April..The growing skepticism toward the megacap rally shows investors are well aware of the risks, should trade tensions flare again and reignite worries around the US economic outlook. The tech behemoths fell harder than the broad market during the early April turmoil, and some investors see a threat that it could happen again..“Right now, high valuations, and to some extent economic impacts of the tariffs, are still worries,” Rocky Fishman, founder of research firm Asym 500, said in an interview..Helped by a positive earnings season, a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven — Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — has rallied 31% since April 8, the day before Trump paused most of his harshest tariffs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index is up 20%..Besides trade-war fears, there are other reasons for concern about the group, such as the amount of cash they’re throwing at artificial intelligence. That spending is fueling concerns about profit margins, and investors have high expectations that those expenditures will pay off..High valuations present another worry. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven gauge is trading at 29 times projected profits, above a 10-year average of 28. That compares with the S&P 500’s forward multiple of 22..Earlier this month, Needham analysts downgraded Apple’s stock to a hold rating, warning that the company’s valuation looks “expensive on several metrics.” They also cited the iPhone maker’s vulnerability to US tariffs..The uptick in demand for hedges underscores investor doubts about the staying power of the current rally, Fishman said..“With these reluctant rallies, where people don’t feel too excited and they just see the market keep on going up, then you start seeing investors getting nervous about giving up the gains they’ve picked up,” said Fishman.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-furious-rally-forces-093000399.html,Market risk

The economy hasn't been impacted by tariffs so far, and demand for AI-related products hasn't slowed a bit. If you've got $1,000 to deploy, I think you will be incredibly happy with the price you've bought these stocks at three to five years down the road..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are at the top of my shopping list right now. Each of these investments brings something different to the table and creates a balanced approach to AI..Of these three, Nvidia represents the growth option. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the go-to computing device for nearly every AI hyperscaler. As a result, Nvidia's revenue boomed over the past few years and is still rapidly growing. In Q1 FY 2026 (ending April 28), its revenue rose 69% year over year to $44 billion, and revenue is projected to rise to $45 billion in Q2, indicating 50% growth. Although that's impressive, growth could be further bolstered by a trade deal with China that allows Nvidia to sell its chips there again or a significant AI buildout in Europe, which appears to be gaining steam recently..The stock isn't cheap at 33 times forward earnings, but that's the price you must pay to own a stock posting market-leading growth..We've only scratched the surface of the computing power necessary to run an economy assisted by AI, which will boost Nvidia's growth over the long run. There's still plenty of growth ahead for Nvidia, and the demand signals it's sending to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing back that up..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is a critical supplier to Nvidia, as Nvidia doesn't have the facilities to manufacture its own chips. So it outsources that work to a chip foundry like TSMC -- the world's top semiconductor foundry, boasting cutting-edge technology and best-in-class execution. Nearly all of the big tech companies are customers of TSMC in one way or another, and its neutral position in the chip world gives it a great view into the future, as chip orders are often placed years in advance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-buy-1-000-091500394.html,Market Risk   Volatility Risk

It now stands on the brink of a deal that would hand it stakes in major operations in Australia and Papua New Guinea — if it can secure regulatory approvals..Santos Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher has rebuffed several approaches from peers over the last few years, and has come under fire from impatient investors. Now the board of Australia’s second-largest fossil fuel producer has recommended Adnoc’s cash offer of $5.76 (A$8.89) per share — a 28% premium to Friday’s close..“Credit to Gallagher for extracting such a premium offer – he will have earned the payout of his ensuing incentives in doing so,” Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee, said in a note. “Gallagher has found his escape parachute and it’s made of gold.”.Santos shares closed 11% higher on Monday at A$7.72 a piece. That’s the biggest daily jump since November 2020, but the stock remains shy of the Adnoc offer, in large part because of the hurdles that lie ahead, including clearance from the Australian authority that reviews foreign investments..“It’s a great price,” Fereidun Fesharaki, founder and chairman of energy consulting group FGE told Bloomberg TV. “XRG is a global entity which wants to create a lot of LNG and upstream capability inside the company. My only question is whether Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board will accept this or not, and I think it will be challenging for them to approve it. In the past they have been very reluctant to make these approvals.”.Fesharaki added that one option would be to keep the current management and Santos as an independent player. “If you can convince them that this will function as an Australian company with foreign ownership, they might go along with it,” he added..A spokesman for the Treasury Department said in a statement that foreign investment matters are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure they aren’t contrary to national interest or security.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adnoc-makes-19-billion-takeover-015430686.html,Market Risk   Credit Risk   Operational Risk   Strategic Risk

It's growing quickly despite its enormous size (its revenue rose 12% last quarter, while its net income soared 46%). Its robust profitability enables it to invest heavily in expanding its business while returning boatloads of cash to shareholders..On the growth front, Alphabet is going all-in on artificial intelligence (AI). It rolled out Gemini 2.5 in the first quarter, its most intelligent AI model. The company is leveraging the power of AI to boost its Google search business through new features, such as AI overviews. It's also providing customers with AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. Meanwhile, it's returning more cash to investors by recently hiking its dividend by 5% and approving a new $70 billion share repurchase authorization..Despite its robust growth, Alphabet trades at a relatively attractive valuation these days.

It’s often due to business reasons like downsizing or restructuring.”.On the surface, employee buyouts may be seen as preferable to layoffs because they allow workers to leave on their own terms, if they want to go. (You can turn down a buyout — more on that below.) But being presented with a buyout offer can be more complicated than that, especially if you suspect your company may follow a round of buyout offers by involuntarily eliminating jobs in the near future..Here’s what sets them apart, and how to decide whether accepting a buyout offer is a good deal for you or not..Workers who have received a buyout offer should carefully review the buyout’s terms before deciding whether to accept. And it’s not just about the money..“A good buyout includes generous severance pay, including the extension of benefits (healthcare and other coverage), possible bonuses, and often doesn’t hurt your unemployment benefits,” Rathod said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/company-offered-buyout-know-140000174.html,Operational Risk
179,2025-06-15 21:45:00,2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Help Make You a Millionaire,Investors are underestimating these large companies hiding in plain sight.,"Amazon's durable growth should help it generate strong returns over the long haul..Alphabet's cheap present valuation and its innovative history make it a buy today..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Building a retirement portfolio that's worth a million dollars is not an insurmountable task. All it takes is a few decades of consistently adding relatively reasonable amounts of money to a diversified stock portfolio every month..If, for example, your portfolio's value is $50,000 today, and you add $200 a month to it steadily from here, it will be worth over $1 million in 30 years, assuming an average rate of return of 10% annually. And that's not an unreasonable assumption -- that's been the market's average annualized rate of return over the long haul..If you have savings sitting in your bank account earning close to zero in interest, perhaps this can be an inspiration to start up that investment account. The best time to begin was yesterday; the second best time to begin is now..But what stocks should you buy for your portfolio? To generate solid long-term returns, you cannot go wrong with some technology giants that are trading today at reasonable prices. Here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) can help lift your portfolio's value past the $1 million mark by the time you retire..Steady growth has been the name of the game at Amazon, and that has made it a monster stock to own over the last few decades. The company has a dominant position in e-commerce in the United States -- and a few other countries as well -- while simultaneously leading the global cloud computing market with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division..E-commerce still has plenty of market share it can steal from physical retail, even in Amazon's home country. E-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales in the United States sat at just 16.2% as of the first quarter of 2025. Despite Amazon's large presence and popularity, online shopping does not account for even $1 out of every $5 spent at retail. While e-commerce's share will not ever approach 100% due to items like fresh groceries -- although Amazon and others are working hard to deliver these, too -- e-commerce should become a much larger piece of the pie in the years to come..Amazon's North American retail sales grew by 8% year over year last quarter, while international sales grew 8% as well when factoring out foreign currency fluctuations. Those revenues could easily keep growing at similar rates for years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-tech-stocks-could-134500618.html,Investment Risk

He has also said that he won't invest in businesses that he understands. So, does that mean the legendary investor doesn't own any AI stocks? Nope..Actually, Buffett has invested roughly $90 billion in nine companies that are heavily focused on AI. Here they are -- and which one is the best of the bunch..Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker is valued at close to $59.3 billion. Although Buffett significantly reduced the conglomerate's position in Apple last year, it still makes up 21% of Berkshire's total portfolio..AI has been at the forefront of Apple's development strategy for years. However, the company was seemingly left behind in the generative AI race until it launched Apple Intelligence in 2024. So far, though, Apple Intelligence doesn't appear to be igniting the super-cycle of iPhone upgrades that some analysts predicted..Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is another top AI stock in Berkshire's portfolio, albeit a much smaller one. Berkshire owns around $2.1 billion of the e-commerce and cloud service giant's shares. Buffett didn't make the initial decision to buy Amazon; one of Berkshire's other investment managers (either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler) bought the stock..Most AI models run in the cloud. As the largest cloud services provider in the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a big winner as organizations scrambled to build and deploy AI models in the cloud. Amazon is also using AI extensively internally to increase efficiency and provide more services to customers..Apple and Amazon are the only AI stocks owned directly by Berkshire Hathaway. But I said that Buffett owned nine AI stocks. Where are the other seven? In Buffett's ""secret portfolio."".General Reinsurance acquired New England Asset Management (NEAM) in 1995. Three years later, Berkshire Hathaway acquired General Re. NEAM continues to manage investments for insurance companies.

On Tuesday, June 10, Reuters reported that OpenAI is partnering with Google Cloud to meet its growing need for computing power, citing three sources familiar with the matter..As both these companies are seen as competitors in AI space, this collaboration is a bit surprising, especially, since OpenAI’s ChatGPT has long been seen as disruptor for Google’s search business. However, the agreement was finalized in May and brings Google into OpenAI’s expanding network of infrastructure providers as it scales training and deployment of advanced AI models..Pixabay/Public Domain.Google Cloud aims to position itself as a flexible and neutral platform for handling high-performance computing workloads, responding to growing industry demand for infrastructure. As per Reuters, a key factor in securing this agreement was the company’s decision to open access to its proprietary Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for external partners..While one of Reuters' sources mentioned that the deal was finalized in May (after months of discussion), none of the concerned companies has agreed to comment on Reuters’ queries..Earlier last week, Wing Aviation LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, announced its plan to expand ‘Wing’ drone delivery to an additional 100 Walmart stores across selected markets. The companies have highlighted this as world’s largest drone delivery expansion..On the announcement, Greg Cathey, SVP, Walmart U.S. Transformation and Innovation, stated:.“As we look ahead, drone delivery will remain a key part of our commitment to redefining retail. We’re pushing the boundaries of convenience to better serve our customers, making shopping faster and easier than ever before.”.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of Google and a pioneer in internet-related services and products, including online advertising technologies, search engines, cloud computing, software, and hardware. The company is also a leading investor in data centers and fiber networks, operating a vast global network of data centers that support its cloud services and other digital offerings..While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

One market where much of the groundwork is being laid for long-term productivity gains from AI is cloud computing. The cloud market was valued at $348 billion, according to Synergy Research, and grew 23% year over year in the first quarter..Top cloud stocks are worth holding for the long term because of their investments in data centers, where companies store data to use with AI to gather insights, innovate, and build new products. Here are two cloud stocks trading at reasonable valuations that are poised for a bull run..Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock has tripled over the last three years, but it still offers upside. This leading cloud infrastructure provider just closed the books on fiscal 2025, where it posted better-than-expected revenue. The stock popped following the report and is closing in on a new all-time high..Oracle has gotten lost in the shadow of the leading hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. But Oracle's cloud revenue growth is about to accelerate significantly, which isn't reflected in the stock's valuation..In fiscal Q4, ended May 31, Oracle's total revenue grew 11% year over year, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle has been capitalizing on AI demand, with more than 100 cloud regions online. In March, management stated that it is becoming the preferred cloud choice for AI training and inferencing due to the superior performance and cost of its Gen 2 cloud architecture..Its growing data center presence, high-speed data transfer capabilities, and power capacity could give Oracle a major competitive advantage in the cloud infrastructure market. The acceleration in its cloud revenue last quarter suggests it could be entering a potent phase of high growth as AI workloads shift from training to inferencing for more sophisticated AI applications..Management's outlook calls for its total cloud revenue growth (applications plus infrastructure) to accelerate from 24% in fiscal 2025 to surpass 40% in fiscal 2026. This could pull Oracle's cloud growth well above AWS, which hasn't been able to crack the 20% growth level over the past year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-cloud-084500808.html,no risk

In my view, Oracle’s bold investments in Cloud services—particularly Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)—are clearly bearing fruit.

Total Cloud revenue—which includes both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)—jumped 27% year-over-year to roughly $6.7 billion. The real highlight was Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which surged 52% to reach $3 billion, underscoring Oracle’s aggressive push to capture AI-heavy workloads in the Cloud Infrastructure space..A key driver behind Oracle’s Cloud momentum is its smartly executed multi-cloud strategy. On the earnings call, Larry Ellison revealed that Oracle’s MultiCloud database services—used by customers on Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Google Cloud (GOOGL)—soared 115% quarter-over-quarter. This approach is savvy, as it turns would-be rivals into collaborators. With enterprise demand rising for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions, Oracle is carving out a distinct competitive edge among the major cloud providers..One of the key reasons I’m bullish on Oracle’s long-term growth is its record-high backlog of contracts, formally known as Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). This quarter, RPO surged 41% year-over-year to an all-time high of $138 billion. That’s a strong signal of sustained demand, providing a significant level of revenue visibility and stability for shareholders over the coming years..Management attributed much of this backlog growth to major contracts with companies like OpenAI, Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD). CEO Safra Catz expressed evident enthusiasm, projecting that Oracle’s Cloud business will grow by more than 40% in Fiscal 2026, with OCI continuing to expand at a rate above 70%. Oracle deserves real credit here—its momentum is undeniable, and Larry Ellison remains the quintessential relentless tech visionary, pushing the company to the forefront of the Cloud and AI revolution.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-orcl-delivers-strong-003100909.html,no risk

The index is up nearly 70% since Oct. 2022, but much of that gain has been driven by just a handful of stocks. The ""Magnificent Seven"" have, for the most part, outperformed the benchmark over that period, and there's a clear reason why..As a group, the Magnificent Seven have produced much better earnings growth than the rest of the S&P 500. Not only that, they've consistently beaten high earnings expectations. That trend continued in the first quarter, but analysts are starting to think their phenomenal run of outperforming everything else in the market may come to an end soon..Here's what investors need to know..After Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released its quarterly earnings on May 28, FactSet reported the Magnificent Seven grew earnings 27.7% in aggregate. That massively outperformed analysts' expectations of 16.0% earnings growth for the group. Here's how it breaks down:.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.59 earnings per share (EPS) vs. $1.36 expected, up 62% year over year..Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL): $2.81 EPS vs. $2.01 expected, up 49% year over year..Meta Platforms: $6.43 EPS vs. $5.22 expected, up 37% year over year..Nvidia: $0.81 EPS vs. $0.75 expected, up 33% year over year..Microsoft: $3.46 EPS vs. $3.22 expected, up 18% year over year..Apple: $1.65 EPS vs. $1.62 expected, up 8% year over year..Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): $0.27 EPS vs. $0.41 expected, down 40% year over year..Six out of the seven outperformed expectations, and five of them grew earnings faster than the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 (9.4%). But as you can see, the level of outperformance and year-over-year growth varies widely from company to company..The weakest showing was most obviously from Tesla, which has suffered from political backlash against CEO Elon Musk, combined with rising competition from Chinese automaker BYD. As a result, deliveries dropped 13% year over year in the first quarter while average selling price also declined. The company's ramp-up in AI spending to support its forthcoming autonomous vehicle efforts also weighed on earnings results.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-still-growing-faster-220000180.html,Valuation Risk

Unlike many of his peers on Wall Street, Ackman primarily keeps a tightly concentrated portfolio, with Pershing Square owning only about 10 stocks at any given time..For the last couple of years, Pershing Square's most direct artificial intelligence (AI) investment has been a sizable position in Alphabet. Ackman has made it clear that its diversified ecosystem -- spanning internet search, cloud computing, advertising, cybersecurity, and more -- combined with an attractive valuation is what enticed Pershing Square to take a position in the ""Magnificent Seven"" member..Well, just a few weeks ago, news broke that Pershing Square had recently initiated a position in another AI stock, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Ackman now joins Warren Buffett, whom he is known to admire, and Cathie Wood as prominent personalities on Wall Street who have exposure to Amazon, through their respective portfolios at Berkshire Hathaway and ARK Invest..Let's explore what makes Amazon such a compelling AI stock for the long haul. I'll break down some trends in the business and the company's valuation to help explain why Amazon has earned the approval of Ackman, Buffett, and Wood..Given how hot AI has become, investors may be challenged to identify which opportunities are best suited for long-term positions. What I mean by that is while semiconductor stocks or AI software businesses have risen in popularity over the last couple of years, it's hard to know which of these companies will continue to be a market leader in 10 years (or longer)..To me, Amazon is like the business version of a Swiss Army knife. The company's core segments are e-commerce and cloud computing infrastructure via Amazon Web Services (AWS)..But it also has a thriving advertising business and a growing subscription service (Amazon Prime), and it has even made some progress in the streaming and entertainment landscape..Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is uniquely positioned to stitch its various operating units together through more AI-powered services.

Apple's Eddy Cue testified that search queries were down on its Safari browser during the month of April for the first time in 22 years, supporting the idea that AI services like ChatGPT are eating into its market share..But a decline in searches on a single browser, while surprising, isn't too concerning. AI is a bigger boost to Alphabet than a challenge. It's seen great success with its AI Overviews in search queries, which management says increase engagement while monetizing at the same level as traditional search results. It's also leveraged AI to offer new features like circle-to-search and Google Lens, which overindex toward valuable product searches..Artificial intelligence has been a massive driver of growth for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. It saw revenue climb 28% in the first quarter, with its operating margin expanding from 9.4% to 17.8%. Management said it remains supply-constrained, so strong revenue growth should continue.

And if such a company pays a rising dividend that can grow over time, that's a big future passive income opportunity..Currently, skepticism abounds for the following three S&P 500 dividend stocks. But scooping up shares today could pay big dividends -- pun intended -- over the long run..The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are generally some of the strongest, most resilient, and innovative companies around, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is by far the cheapest of the bunch. Shares trade at just around 20 times earnings, not only a discount to peers but even the overall market..And while its dividend is only 0.5%, Alphabet's payout ratio is just 8.9%, leaving huge room for growth. Instead of a bigger dividend, Alphabet is returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases, while also investing in future AI growth..Of course, the reason Alphabet's stock has been under pressure is due to concerns over its main cash cow, Google Search, and the threat posed by AI chatbots..While that is something to monitor, Alphabet has been innovating in AI rapidly, delivering ""AI Overviews"" when users search a topic, which management claims monetizes at the same rate as Search. The company also unveiled ""AI Mode"" in Google Search on May 20, offering the experience of a chatbot within the Search ecosystem..Furthermore, Alphabet has been rapidly catching up to AI chatbot leader OpenAI in large language models (LLMs). When Alphabet's Gemini 2.5 LLM was released on March 25, it immediately rocketed up the developer rankings among top-performing LLMs, seizing the current lead for many applications..Given Alphabet's technical talent and financial resources, I'd expect the company to muddle through this transition. But even if Search growth slows down, there are other AI-related growth opportunities related to Gemini-powered chatbots and agents..Meanwhile, Alphabet has three other large and growing businesses the market appears to be ignoring: YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. YouTube is the the largest streaming company in the world, and growing by double-digits. Google Cloud, while the third-place infrastructure platform, still grew 28% last quarter to a $50 billion annual revenue run-rate, and has been profitable since the first quarter of 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-p-500-dividend-083000955.html,Market Risk   Dividend Risk   Inherent Risk

The company's ongoing spectacular growth could be seen in its fiscal Q1 results: The $39.1 billion in data center revenue it booked was more than 9 times the $4.3 billion in data center revenue it generated in its Q1 just two years prior..Make no mistake, Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies to continue to benefit from the ongoing AI boom. However, the company is now massive, and as the base used to measure its growth gets bigger, the percentage gains are likely to get smaller because comparisons will get tougher. Investors shouldn't be surprised if percentage growth rates decline..For investors looking to diversify their AI infrastructure exposure or find investments with potentially more upside than Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are two strong alternatives. Here's why..While Nvidia's GPUs dominate the market for AI training chips, AMD has carved out a niche in AI inference, which is expected to become the much larger market over time. Nvidia's CUDA platform gives it a clear edge in AI model training, thanks to its broad hardware support, strong documentation, developer loyalty, and a deep library of AI tools that are already built and optimized to boost its GPU performance. However, once models are trained, running them (inference) is more about cost, latency, and efficiency..AMD's ROCm software has steadily improved, and while it still lags far behind CUDA for training, it's generally considered good enough for running inference workloads. That's important because inference demand is starting to accelerate, and cost-effectiveness plays a much bigger role in chip selection.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-buy-2-artificial-082000561.html,Market Risk

Pure-play quantum computing companies face financial challenges that could easily diminish their ability to drive long-term returns.

Its quantum bits, called qubits, can store any value between zero and one. This factor makes quantum computers exponentially faster than traditional computers, whose bits can only store zeroes and ones..However, quantum computing is also a solution without a problem to solve, dramatically limiting its addressable market. With most companies in this industry unable to generate sufficient revenues, many quantum computing stocks have struggled to maintain their stock gains. But amid market conditions, one specific quantum stock could prosper during the remainder of 2025..Amid the current state of the market, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) should appear attractive to investors..Admittedly, this may appear to be a baffling choice at first glance. The company generated more than $90 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, with over 99% of that revenue coming from its digital advertising businesses and Google Cloud. Seeing those numbers arguably raises the question of why one should consider Alphabet a quantum computing investment when the technology has no representation in the company's financial statements..However, such a strategy makes more sense when considering the state of pure-play quantum computing companies. Without an apparent addressable market, such companies depend on government contracts that fall far short of covering the company's operating expenses..The financials of these companies outline the struggle. In the first quarter, IonQ reported $7.5 million in revenue, a small fraction of its $83.2 million in costs and expenses. Even with $38.5 million in gains on the fair value of warrant liabilities, it still lost $38.3 million..Rigetti Computing reported a similar story, with revenue of $1.5 million falling far short of the $22.1 million in operating expenses. Interestingly, a $53.3 million change in the fair value of derivative warrant liabilities helped it earn $42.6 million in net income for the quarter..Still, investors cannot depend on one-time benefits for long-term profitability, and with operating expenses far exceeding revenue for both companies, such pure-play quantum computing companies look like less attractive options.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-quantum-computing-stock-surge-072500394.html,Market Risk

In between, his anagram technology was used by author Dan Brown for the Da Vinci Code and he even identified the most boring date in history..The first keyboard seeds were sown at Dundee High School in Scotland where he was able to venture to the technical college next door before classes and during breaks to write computer software on its mainframe..There were financial rewards, too.

Tunstall-Pedoe charts the company as a ""10-year adventure"", seven as a venture-backed independent start-up before being sold to Amazon in 2012 for a reported £21m and its CEO staying on for over three years..“When we launched, we were trying to solve the problem of basically using computers by speaking to them or with language,” he recalls..“When you look at science fiction I watched as a child, Star Trek or Blake's 7, all the computers you just have a chat to. It understands you and is the most natural interface. This is how we interact with people..“But when you used a computer back then, you select from a menu, click a button or you guess keywords and browse links that come back from the keyword search. So we were tackling the problem of how to use language to interact with machines, which of course is incredibly topical now because large language models (LLMs) have essentially cracked that. But we were doing this way back.”.In the mid 2000s, Tunstall-Pedoe would demo his software on conversational search and recalls being told by Google (GOOG) that not only was this a worse customer experience but that keyword search was infinitely better.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-alexa-echo-ai-william-tunstall-pedoe-050005378.html,no risk

It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI..Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition..The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors' access to Scale's services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals' operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet's Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta's stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back..In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google..Alexandr Wang, Scale's 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale's board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed..Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University..Trump's antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added..""That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do.
