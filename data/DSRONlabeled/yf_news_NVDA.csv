For more, I want to bring in now Dave Mozza, chief executive officer at Round Hill Investments. Dave, it's great to see you. Let let's start there with Nvidia, Dave. Uh it's a name you know well. What do you make of the move off the April low we have seen there, Dave, and what do you see ahead for Jensen Huang's company? .Yeah, look, Nvidia is showing its leadership uh through this market rally. And one of the reasons being is like there's a lot of resiliency with the AI trade. I think obviously the deep seek news which happened before the liberation day sell off, you know, brought a lot of skittishness to investors on on sort of the durability of that trade and actually more so the durability for companies like Nvidia to continue to power through that. Um but what we've seen is Nvidia is actually navigated well this environment. Certainly questions about that China market share that they're likely going to continue to lose. But now with the introduction of sovereign AI deals, I think Nvidia is showing that they have a lot more going for it than just sort of relying on what they've been doing with data centers and the hyperscalars in the US and even even a country as important or a market is important to it as like China. .I also, Dave, I want to talk about this new ETF of yours which includes Nvidia and the focus is humanoid robots, Dave. And listen, robots we know, you know, it's not a new investing theme. It's been around for some time. So so why why launch this product now, Dave? .Yeah, so it's interesting. Nvidia is actually the second largest holding uh in the portfolio. Not that they're making robots, but actually their Jets and AI uh is incredibly important uh for the growth of humanoid robotics. But to answer your point specifically on the why now is that we're seeing a convergence of trends um that are really we believe going to benefit robots, but particularly humanoid robotics. And one is this ongoing labor shortage, particularly for uh what are called the 3Ds of work. Um so that's dull work, that's dirty work, and dangerous work. Um so these this is work. Um dull work is repetitive work stocking shelves. We know that a humanoid robot can can do work of that nature. Of course dangerous work, um having a a robot do that as opposed to a human can be beneficial. Um and then dirty work, cleaning sludge and things of that nature. Um and so because of the power of AI, the computational capabilities plus the cost of those capabilities coming down, now's really the time that we're seeing sort of the potential for explosion of of humanoid robots. And also this idea of embedded intelligence embedded AI uh is coming and it's happening now with humanoid robotics. So we really think this is the next wave of AI growth.

1,2025-06-27 05:09:00,Nvidia rally persists: What worries this analyst about AI trade,"Nvidia (NVDA) climbs higher, hitting fresh record highs. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers have underperformed other AI-related names in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), like Palantir (PLTR), Vistra (VST), and Dell (DELL). Wall Street Horizon head of corporate event research, Christine Short, tells Market Domination host Josh Lipton, Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman, and Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer that it's competition with Chinese AI companies that she worries could threaten the AI play.

However, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker and its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers have underperformed other AI-related names in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), like Palantir (PLTR), Vistra (VST), and Dell (DELL)..Wall Street Horizon head of corporate event research, Christine Short, tells Market Domination host Josh Lipton, Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman, and Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer that it's competition with Chinese AI companies that she worries could threaten the AI play..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Green all over the place, Christine, we just keep grinding higher here. What do you make of it? .Yeah, look, investor appetite is there, right? AI enthusiasm has returned. We just talked about Nvidia. Um, I think there were some whispers today about is this, you know, signifying a bubble here? Is this .com 2.0 with Nvidia being at almost record highs here? And if you look at what analysts are saying, and I know we're going to hear from one, you know, that covers Nvidia here soon, um, no one's saying that this is overvalued. I think many are actually saying that we're still undervalued here on Nvidia because we haven't quite priced in AI and the impact on productivity. We heard from CEO of Salesforce today, Mark Benioff, saying that 30 to 50% of their workload is now done by AI. And we've seen a slew of companies cut, you know, positions because of AI, whether it be Salesforce or CrowdStrike, Klarna, so, or, or Duolingo, who's actually going to be more discreet about hiring because of AI. So I don't think we've, we've folded in the full impact. The one concern I have, and maybe it's not so much a concern, but what I'm watching is competition from Chinese AI companies. There was a great report in Datatrack Research earlier in the week that just showed the valuations are so much more appetizing on some of those Chinese AI names versus, you know, the US ones. And the returns have actually been higher for those names. So that's one area that I'm watching is, is the competition between us and those Chinese AI names. .Josh, you know, Julie mentioned it briefly, but I want to get double tap on it. The mag 7 names, Josh, those giants, right? How have they been working? .Yeah, yeah, Josh. So I have a visual representation over here on our big board, right, of sort of some of what Julie was talking about. And what I'm looking at here is just performance since the April 8th low. Uh, most of these stocks here are all in the top 20 of the S&P 500. They're all AI tied. So I looked at sort of an AI basket of stocks, right? You have Oracle, Broadcom, Dell, AMD, NRG, as Julie mentioned, Vistra, which is sort of an AI power play, and Palantir. What's interesting is all of the mag 7 have underperformed them, right? So Nvidia's up about 60% at a new high. Really the rest of these companies have come up about 25, 30% maybe from the bottom. Apple hasn't really gone anywhere. And Christine, I guess the question this sort of brings me to for you is just, is the next AI trade going to continue to be the broadening out of this trade into cloud computing, into energy, into some of the other chip names, or is that, is that sort of where it feels like this trade is headed as we go through kind of the second half of 25? .Yeah, I think we, we are already seeing that broadening out. There's a lot of liquidity in the market, and I think what surprised me the most is how quickly we've rebounded from that April low. And it just goes to show the appetite, the enthusiasm amongst, you know, all of tech. So not just within the AI space, but there is liquidity there. There was cash on the sidelines for quite a while. And now, you know, many of those investors bought the dip, and now we're seeing it rip. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-rally-persists-worries-analyst-200925188.html,Competitive Risk

Micron (MU) reported an earnings beat for the third quarter and issued strong fourth quarter guidance..Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal outlines the latest on Morning Brief..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..Ali, of course, one of the other major stories that we're tracking this morning is just the move that we're seeing in Nvidia. Fresh record high that we had just seen yesterday here. What more could continue to thrust this stock to the upside? .Yeah, and Nvidia shares they are up around 1% today in pre-market trading set to open at a record. We closed at a record just extending a lot of those gains there. And for a a company like Nvidia, there just seems to be a lot of momentum. I've been speaking with a lot of strategists who tell me that they believe Nvidia is undervalued at this point, that there's a lot more room to run in this tech trade. It was interesting. They talked about different positioning that investors were taking at the beginning of the year, and really after those April lows that we saw following Trump's liberation day, where investors took some money and put it into more defensive sectors of the economy. And now we're seeing that maybe it's better to be overweight tech. There's a lot of cash on the sidelines, so I feel like for a company like Nvidia and really the tech trade at large, there just seems to be more room to run. .And so as we're tracking the tech trade as well, we we do know that Micron is also in focus within that. So how are we hearing some of the analysts out there really kind of weigh the the thesis around Nvidia versus some of the other semiconductor names right now? .Yeah, Micron just reported a really solid earnings, a beat on both the top and bottom lines. We saw Q3 revenue jump. We saw a really solid forecast, and the key growth driver here for Micron is high bandwidth memory or HBM. This is used to power AI data centers and HBM sales rose nearly 50% quarter over quarter. JP Morgan expects a run rate of $8 billion soon. We saw the stock pop in after hours. We then saw a bit of trimming when it comes to some of those gains as executives offered more cautious commentary around those HBMs. Still, we're seeing shares up modestly this morning, and that's lifting all of the chip makers really, not just Nvidia, but also names like Marvel technology, AMD, TSM. Those are all up moving to the upside as well this morning. So it just speaks to the wave of demand that we're seeing for the AI trade and really these chip makers at large.

He once said that he wakes up at three in the morning and goes:.""What an idiot. Why didn’t I invest more in Bitcoin?"".While it might seem odd that Laffont put Bitcoin on par with some of the world's most valuable companies, his assessment isn't entirely off the mark..If Bitcoin — with a market cap of $2.13 trillion — were an asset, it would be the world's fifth-largest company behind Nvidia ($3.78 trillion), Microsoft ($3.69 trillion), Apple ($3 trillion), and Amazon ($2.3 trillion)..Laffont thinks Bitcoin's market cap could potentially grow more than twice to over $5 trillion by 2030.

The move allowed the AI titan to reclaim the title of the world's most valuable company — but one firm thinks the rally isn't even close to being over..The stock extended its record high on Thursday, rising about 1% to $155..The latest jump to record highs marks an impressive comeback for Nvidia after struggling against headwinds like the reveal of China's DeepSeek AI and the impact of tariffs earlier in the year..But the party is just getting started, according to one analyst..Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital raised his Nvidia price target to $250, a bold move even among AI bulls. It's the highest price target on the Street, implying an upside of 127% and a market cap of $6 trillion..A $6 trillion market cap might sound crazy, but ""the math just works,"" according to Baruah. If you think AI infrastructure spending is robust now, brace yourself for even bigger capex from the AI hypercalers..Loop Capital sees a coming surge in data center spending as companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue to increase their investments in the technology..Loop Capital estimates that spending on non-CPU compute like GPUs and AI accelerators could soar as hyperscalers boost non-CPU compute from around 15% of their infrastructure to 50%-60% by 2028..They said their work ""suggests that Hyperscale & AI Factory (Sovereign, Neocloud & Enterprise) Gen AI & AI Accelerator compute spending ALONE could increase to~$2.0T by 2028 using current compute economics."".Nvidia also anticipates rising demand for AI factories, which are vertically integrated data centers built to train AI models. Loop Capital's projections suggest Nvidia has ""line of sight"" to tens of gigawatts of demand in the next two to three years..Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that every gigawatt of demand translates into around $40 to $50 billion of Nvidia revenue, implying $450 to $900 billion of sales in the pipeline..Additionally, the newest AI reasoning models are much more compute-intensive—and expensive—than anticipated, taking up to 150x more compute than traditional LLMs. That means Big Tech companies are growing their tokens at a rapid rate and spending more money on Nvidia AI server systems.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-could-end-worth-6-141846277.html,Market Risk

10,2025-06-27 06:07:00,"Markets Surge on Tech Trade, ""Not Critical"" Tariffs","To whatever extent people were checking their calendars for trade-busting tariffs on the horizon, they're not doing so now.","Thursday, June 26, 2025We started this trading week with some questions about the ability of the stock market to overcome some perceived major hurdles, a burgeoning war in the Middle East among them. Also, we’ve gotten a large dollop of economic news thus far for the week, including this morning’s Weekly Jobless Claims and Q1 GDP.And yet, nothing seems to faze market participants at this point and time. All markets except the small-cap Russell 2000 are now up for the year, with the S&P 500 a hair away from all-time highs back in February. The AI trade is back on to bolster tech stocks: NVIDIA NVDA and Palantir PLTR, for instance, are at new record highs. And the White House press secretary earlier today said the July 9th deadline on reciprocal tariffs is “not critical,” meaning, perhaps, in the minds of stock market investors, “non-existent.” Basically, to whatever extent people were checking their calendars for trade-busting tariffs on the horizon, they’re not doing so now — and it’s a cause for celebration.Finally, worsening Continuing Jobless Claims, reported on this morning in this space, indicate a labor market that is noticeably weakening. While this is not a good sign economically overall, it may provide a way forward for the Fed to resume cutting interest rates, which it hasn’t done all year. Lowering rates is key to unlocking plenty of other aspects of the economy that haven’t performed quite so well as NVIDIA and Palantir, such as the housing market...Reporting fiscal Q4 earnings after today’s close is Nike NKE, and expectations were for a fairly dismal quarter. Fortunately, Nike beat on its bottom line for now the eighth-straight quarter with earnings of 14 cent per share, 2 cents better than anticipated. Revenues in the quarter came in at $11.1 billion. That said, these results pale in comparison to the year-ago figures of $1.01 per share on $12.61 billion in sales.Full-year revenues of $46.3 billion outpaced the Zacks consensus, but were still down -10% year over year. North America revenues were down -11% year over year, and that same -11% applied to all regions around the world combined. After gaining +2.8% on this strong day of regular trading, however, Nike shares are down -1.6% on this earnings news...At some point, investors will again begin evaluating these market levels after such a convincing bull run. We’re not sure if tomorrow will be the day, but Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data Friday morning may be a guide toward what to expect. Year over year projections are for a +2.3% read on PCE growth, +2.6% on core. These are near the Fed’s inflation target of +2.0%, so any surprise closer to that mark may also be met with market exuberance.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Most investors know, by now, that NVIDIA is the leading semiconductor maker of chips used in AI. The stock is again hitting all-time highs..But what else can you invest in if you want to own companies involved in the AI Revolution?.There is no magic list of “AI stocks” especially if you’re looking outside of the big caps. How do investors find hidden gems?.Both Tracey and Ethan have found them “organically” while using the Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is Zacks’ stock system which looks for changes in analyst earnings estimates. It is a short-term trading recommendation of just 1 to 3 months..Rising earnings estimates usually indicate something “good” is going on at a company. And if you dig deeper, you may find that the company is involved in the AI Revolution in some way, either through the chips, infrastructure, or it is an end-user..This isn’t an easy process. That’s why Tracey and Ethan are sharing on the podcast some of the AI stocks they have discovered this year..1. Solaris Energy Infrastructure (SEI).Solaris Energy Infrastructure is in the Oil and Gas: Mechanical and Equipment industry on Zacks but has two segments: Power Solutions and Logistics. Power Solutions is now 80% of the business and some customers include data centers..If you’re looking for an AI stock, the word “data centers” is usually a dead giveaway. Solaris Energy sees multi-year unprecedented growth..The analysts appear to agree. Solaris Energy is expected to grow earnings by 32% this year and another 90% in 2026..Solaris is a rare small cap company that also pays a dividend, currently yielding 1.7%..Should Solaris Energy Infrastructure be on your AI short list?.2. Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL).Marvell is a large cap digital storage company. It is moving into AI solutions. Marvell is one of the cheaper technology AI stocks.

The company capitalizes on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion. Strong Office 365 Commercial demand has been propelling Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth. ARPU increases through E5 and M365 Copilot uptake across key segments. Intelligent Cloud revenues advance through Azure AI development and AI Copilot business growth. Strategic execution has been enhancing non-AI services through enterprise customer growth and operational scale improvements. Xbox content and services benefit from robust performance across third-party and first-party content offerings. The Zacks analyst expects that fiscal 2025 net sales will increase 13.7% compared to fiscal 2024. However, elevated operating expenses and Azure investments amid intensifying cloud competition remain concerns for the stakeholders.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +20.8%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. Continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with over 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles space. The Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 28.95% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell and Ada GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Bank of America’s shares have gained +22.3% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s gain of +40.9%.

The Zacks analyst expect NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% by 2027. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 5.8% in 2025.Nevertheless, the volatile nature of the trading business is a concern. Despite an impressive trading performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward, thus hurting fee income growth. We project non-interest income to rise only 4.5% in 2025. Also, steady investments in the franchise will likely keep operating expenses elevated, thus hurting profitability.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $199.92 million has achieved seven consecutive profitable quarters, driven by margin expansion and operational efficiency. First-quarter 2025 GAAP EPS rose to $0.55 and adjusted EPS to $0.68, supported by a product mix shift to higher-margin BKR 9000 radios and an asset-light model.Gross margin was 47%, and the 2025 guidance targets exceed $2.80 in adjusted EPS. The BKR 9000 is expanding across public safety verticals and the BK ONE SaaS platform adds high-margin, recurring revenue potential. A growing hardware-software ecosystem aims to boost the addressable market tenfold by 2027. Strong liquidity funds growth, but risks include federal revenue reliance, execution risk in SaaS adoption, margin pressure from tariffs and delays in mobile product launches.

For Arista, survival now hinges on reinvention, fast execution, and a serious rethink of its AI roadmap..Santa Clara-based Arista Networks (ANET) is a leading player in cloud networking, specializing in high-performance Ethernet switches for large-scale data centers and enterprise environments. The company has built a reputation for delivering software-driven networking solutions powered by its proprietary Extensible Operating System (EOS), which offers scalability, programmability, and reliability..Arista commands a market cap of $119.3 billion, underscoring its significance in the tech and networking industry. ANET stock has dipped by 12.9% in 2025 due to a mix of rising competitive pressure, shifting demand, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Investors are increasingly wary of Nvidia’s aggressive entry into AI-optimized Ethernet switches, which threatens Arista’s core market share..Yet, over the past 52 weeks, ANET rose 15.2%, surging by over 10.8% over the past three months alone..ANET stock is not cheap, priced at 39.9 times forward adjusted earnings and 16.5 times sales, trading well above the sector medians and even its historical averages. That premium once made sense, thanks to Arista’s Ethernet dominance in AI. But with Nvidia bulldozing into the same space, that crown feels shaky. Premiums only last with a wide moat, and right now, Nvidia is already halfway across Arista’s shrinking trench..Arista Networks reported a stronger-than-expected first quarter of 2025 on May 6, crossing $2 billion in revenue for the first time, up 27.6% year over year.

These numbers show investors are paying a premium for AMD, but the company’s financial results help explain why..In the first quarter of 2025, AMD brought in $7.4 billion in revenue, up 36% from last year. This was mostly because of strong demand in the Data Center segment, which grew 57% thanks to solid EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU sales..The Client segment also did well, with revenue up 68% on the back of the latest Ryzen processors, while the Gaming and Embedded segments had more mixed results. Gross margins stayed healthy at 50% on a GAAP basis and 54% non-GAAP, and net income reached $709 million GAAP, with earnings per share of $0.44..AMD’s next phase is being shaped by more than just new chips.

Time to discover –.The Department of Defense, the U.S. Army, the Marine Corps, and the National Science Foundation, among others, receive custom AI-powered solutions from C3.ai. The company recently received a contract increase with the U.S. Air Force, raising the limit to $450 million from $100 million..C3.ai’s AI solutions will help the U.S. Air Force identify maintenance needs for aircraft, weapon systems and equipment. In fiscal year (FY) 2025, federal government contracts accounted for approximately 26% of C3.ai’s bookings, which ended on April 30..In FY 2025, C3.ai also experienced a substantial rise in bookings from the oil and gas industry, including Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM. Most notably, a renewed partnership with Baker Hughes Company BKR drove sales higher. C3.ai’s revenues in FY 2025 reached $389.1 million, a 25% increase from the previous year. Projections for FY 2026 suggest sales between $447.5 million and $484.5 million..Additionally, partnerships with Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Alphabet Inc.

It offers AI training and inference cloud services built upon a growing stockpile of Nvidia GPUs. One of its investors is Nvidia, which helps it obtain the precious, short-in-supply chips..CoreWeave has both Microsoft and OpenAI as customers — the latter signed a deal to buy $12 billion worth of services and still has about $11 billion worth to buy. And Nvidia increased its stake after the IPO, the company disclosed..But CoreWeave borrows money against the GPUs to pay for them, and its IPO wasn’t big enough to get it out of that cycle.

The internet is only a few decades old..Technological innovation has accelerated significantly since the early 2000s, with the internet playing a pivotal role in paving the way for cloud computing. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as the next growth frontier for investors. The companies leading the way have grown to immense size and scale, garnering the nickname the ""Magnificent Seven."".The exciting part is that it appears there is still a massive runway ahead for future innovation and the continuation of ongoing trends. Three companies stand out to me. They have become juggernauts and could be unstoppable technology leaders well into the future..Here are the three monster stocks you should consider investing in for the long term..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a huge impact since the push to build artificial intelligence infrastructure went into overdrive in late 2022. Companies continue to race to build massive data centers with thousands of the company's GPU accelerator chips. It started with Nvidia's Hopper microarchitecture and has since evolved into Blackwell. According to IoT Analytics Research, Nvidia owns an estimated 92% of the AI data center GPU market..While data center spending continues to rip and roar in 2025, it's wise to think about AI's next innings. There is a good chance that computing resources will expand beyond data centers to localized areas where they can power new technologies, such as humanoid robotics or autonomous vehicles. Nvidia already has its eyes on these opportunities, fleshing out an ecosystem of hardware and developer tools that will entice companies to build on its platform..Many of the companies building all these data centers continue to struggle with capacity constraints, so it doesn't seem that Nvidia's business will slow anytime soon. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 today. That may seem like a lot, but considering analysts estimate Nvidia will grow earnings by nearly 29% annualized over the long term, the reigning AI leader should continue to deliver for investors over the coming years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-stocks-unstoppable-monsters-163400575.html,Market Risk

As of the end of Q1 2025, Harvard Management Co.’s portfolio indicates that the position in the stock has reduced by approximately 36% quarter-over-quarter to 507,831 shares (around 5% portfolio’s weight)..On June 16, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer reiterated his Outperform rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), maintaining a price target of $175. His outlook reflects continued optimism around Nvidia’s central role in the AI infrastructure buildout, supported by recent insights from company leadership during Oppenheimer’s 23rd Annual Semiconductor Bus Tour and discussions with Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress and IR Director Stewart Stecker.. .Management is actively engaging with global policymakers to support sovereign AI infrastructure, a market Nvidia estimates could exceed $1.5 trillion in total addressable opportunity. Europe alone could account for $120 billion of that market, with demand generally scaling in line with GDP. According to Schafer, these discussions reinforce Nvidia’s first-mover advantage in the AI ecosystem..Looking ahead, Nvidia expects large-scale AI data centers, or “AI factories”, to emerge within the next two to three years. A single gigawatt-scale facility could represent a $40–$50 billion market for Nvidia, with early deployments anticipated by 2027 and broader multi-gigawatt buildouts by 2028..Nvidia’s AI revenue currently skews 60/40 between training and inference, but management expects inference to gain ground. The company’s full-stack approach — combining GPUs, networking, and software — remains well suited to both workloads, positioning it competitively as AI use cases diversify..Schafer also highlighted NVLink Fusion, Nvidia’s new interconnect technology, which allows customers to mix CPU architectures (e.g., x86 alongside ARM-based Grace CPUs) without performance trade-offs, potentially broadening Nvidia’s addressable market..While U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports have impacted sales to China, prompting a $4.5 billion write-down, management views the exposure as manageable, with China now contributing less than 5% of total revenue..In summary, Schafer continues to see Nvidia as a leader in the AI space, backed by product strength, global momentum, and a deep pipeline of long-term opportunities..Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading innovator in the design and production of graphics processing units (GPUs), system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions, and AI-driven hardware and software. The company’s GPUs are used in gaming, high-performance computing, AI training, and inference and serve as the backbone of data center infrastructure worldwide..While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But there's one AI stock that has recently been struggling, and it could be an attractive buy on weakness..Shares of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) are down a whopping 32% since the start of the year after the company's recent performance and guidance underwhelmed investors and analysts. It's off by more than 40% from its 52-week high of $127.48..The tech company develops application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) which its customers can use as custom chips in their data centers. They can be cost-effective alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs, which are designed to serve broader, more generic needs and workloads. .But despite a huge opportunity in AI, Marvell's stock hasn't been doing well of late. Could it be a bargain buy in a red-hot AI market, or are there problems that should keep you away from buying this stock right now?.It hasn't been a bad year for AI stocks as a whole. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF has risen by 13% so far in 2025. Even the S&P 500 is up close to 2% after plunging well into negative territory following the U.S. announcement of global tariffs in April. .The big issue is that when Marvell released its results earlier in the year, investors weren't thrilled with the chipmaker's guidance, and it perhaps wasn't as rosy as it should have been. Some analysts were hoping for $2 billion in revenue for the first quarter (which ended on May 3). Instead, the company's forecast was for around $1.88 billion, so a sell-off ensued. .The good news is that Q1 sales came in a little better than expected at nearly $1.9 billion. For the current quarter, management is now expecting net sales of around $2 billion. While the stock is up since the release of its most recent results, it hasn't been able to recover from the sell-off that took place earlier in the year. .Shares of Marvell were already beginning to decline before its guidance miss earlier in the year, likely due to its inflated valuation. The stock had been an expensive buy, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of more than 40 (based on analyst expectations). At such a high premium, analysts are expecting the company to not only post strong numbers, but also to provide a strong guidance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-more-30-could-struggling-140000924.html,Financial Risk

Shares extended that gain in early trading Thursday, rising as much as 3.7%, on track for a record close..Palantir, which makes software used by governments and corporations to analyze large volumes of data, is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year amid excitement about its artificial intelligence products and signs that it’s winning more business from the Trump administration. Palantir is also the most expensive stock in the benchmark, however, with a price to estimated sales ratio of 76 times. Nvidia Corp., by contrast, is priced at 17 times..The momentum behind Palantir, which helped send shares to a fresh intraday record on Wednesday, has made it dangerous to bet against, even though the valuation is difficult to justify, said Thomas George, president at Grizzle Investment Management..“The frenzy can go on for longer than the bears or shorts would like, and we’ve seen too many people get their fingers chopped off trying to short something,” George said. “It really feels like the stock is trading on vibes.”.While Palantir stands out on Wall Street for both its lofty multiple and the size of its rally, the stock has proven remarkably resilient, frustrating those betting on a reversal. Some have even likened it to a meme stock, given the heavy interest from retail investors who think demand for AI software will keep Palantir’s revenue expanding at a rapid clip..Palantir’s work with government and military customers has been in particular focus in recent sessions as US strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend raised the specter of a broader conflict in the Middle East.

Instead, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) tend to dominate the headlines. But Broadcom has quietly and steadily become a key player behind the curtain. As AI reshapes everything from cloud infrastructure to autonomous vehicles, Broadcom’s influence is proving to be anything but background noise..Now sitting comfortably in the trillion-dollar club, Broadcom’s strength lies in its highly specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which power the custom AI chips used by tech leaders like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META). These ASICs form the backbone of modern data centers, enabling the intense computational workloads required for cutting-edge AI models..Tesla’s Robotaxis Reportedly Sped and Veered Into the Wrong Lanes.

This time, it's thanks to a bold new Street-high price target of $400 from HSBC, signaling strong conviction in the company’s long-term growth. Could Broadcom actually hit that mark before year-end?.Based in Palo Alto, California, Broadcom spans semiconductors, enterprise software, and cybersecurity, offering a broad portfolio that supports critical technology infrastructure. Its solutions are found across cloud platforms, data centers, wireless networks, and connected devices, playing a behind-the-scenes role in keeping digital systems up and running..With a market capitalization hovering around $1.2 trillion, Broadcom has shown impressive strength in 2025, managing to outperform despite broader market choppiness. While the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained a modest 3.5% year-to-date (YTD), AVGO stock has surged with a 14% YTD climb..The real momentum, however, has come in recent months. Shares have surged 40% over the past three months alone, fueled by rising demand for AI infrastructure and investor optimism. Looking over the past year, Broadcom’s 67% return dwarfs the S&P 500’s 11% gain, highlighting just how sharply the chip giant has broken away from the pack..In its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report released on June 5, Broadcom delivered a standout performance. The firm posted revenue of $15 billion, narrowly beating estimates of $14.95 billion and marking a strong 20% year-over-year (YOY) increase. The growth was fueled by soaring demand for AI semiconductors, while contributions from VMware added an extra boost to the top line, reinforcing Broadcom’s expanding footprint across both hardware and software.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-stock-hit-400-2025-133002755.html,Market Risk

That boom was largely fueled by the expansion of the AI market, which drove many companies to upgrade their data centers with its top-tier GPUs to process complex machine learning and AI tasks..Nvidia's stock rose about 16% over the past 12 months, even as the company grappled with tighter export curbs, tariffs, and other macroeconomic headwinds. However, investors who wanted even bigger gains were likely drawn toward the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ: NVDL), which aims to double Nvidia's gains on a daily basis..That sounds like an incredible way to profit from the AI boom, but is it really a good investment? Let's review the two reasons to buy the Granite Shares ETF -- and three reasons to avoid it..The Granite Shares ETF might be an appealing investment for two reasons. First, it can help short-term traders generate big gains from any news or earnings-driven rallies for Nvidia..Second, it aims to double the chipmaker's daily returns with total-return swaps and other derivatives. These derivatives can be difficult for mainstream investors to understand, so the ETF simplifies the process in a package and eliminates the need for a margin account or options trading. Therefore, investors won't ever lose more than their initial investment or be hit by margin calls during a downturn..The NVDA Daily ETF might sound like a good way to profit from Nvidia's gains, but it has three glaring weaknesses. First, its gains aren't cumulative because it resets its 2x objective on a daily basis. Second, it also doubles Nvidia's losses if it declines..So while the ETF might be a good short-term play if Nvidia's stock rallies for several consecutive days, a single red day can wipe out a lot of those gains. That's why the NVDA Daily ETF has been a terrible investment for the long term. Over the past 12 months, its shares actually declined 17% even as Nvidia's stock rose..Even if Nvidia rallies over a long period, the ETF can suffer a volatility drag behind its underlying stock because it makes adjustments every day to meet its investment objective. That constant rebalancing, along with its leverage, makes it tougher for the fund to stay ahead of Nvidia and meet its goal of doubling the chipmaker's daily returns.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-reasons-buy-nvdl-3-132200386.html,Investment Product Risk

Enchant enables researchers to determine the viability of new drug molecules and make high-confidence predictions where data is most sparse, helping address the critical real-world challenge of understanding how novel drug candidates may affect a patient while still in the earliest stages of discovery. Iambic’s recently announced Enchant v2 provides accurate predictions for dozens of biological, physiochemical, pharmacokinetic, metabolic, safety, and other properties essential for clinical success..""With the release of Enchant v2, we demonstrated both the model’s accuracy and scalability and we believe we can rapidly build on these gains through model scale alone,"" said Matt Welborn, PhD, Iambic’s VP of Machine Learning. ""We are expanding our successful relationship with Lambda to an NVIDIA HGX B200 cluster, which will accelerate this opportunity and the breadth of pre-clinical and clinical endpoints Enchant can predict, increasing the likelihood of a molecules' success in human studies and the efficiency of drug development."".Enchant’s high-confidence predictions enable multi-parameter optimization for the design of potentially more effective medicines, program prioritization, and the design of clinical trials for the potentially rapid translation of novel medicines. Iambic researchers also demonstrated that in some cases Enchant can be a better predictor of in vivo drug clearance than in vitro experiments – a key advancement as regulators look for drug developers to broaden their use of in silico testing. Today, Enchant is the leading model in the field based on performance benchmarks across diverse molecular property prediction tasks..""We're thrilled to deepen our partnership with Iambic, a leader in AI-driven drug discovery,"" said Robert Brooks IV, Founding Team and VP, Revenue.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, NVDA reported that nearly 100 NVIDIA-powered AI factories are currently in progress, twice the number from a year ago. Each factory is also using more graphics processing units (GPUs) than before, showing strong demand for large-scale AI compute infrastructure..These AI factories use more than just NVIDIA chips. They also rely on NVIDIA’s networking tools (like NVLink and Spectrum-X), software platforms (such as CUDA and NeMo) and full-stack systems. This makes it harder for customers to switch to other providers. Hence, once customers choose NVIDIA, they often stay..Governments and large enterprises across the world, including Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, are working with NVIDIA to build sovereign AI infrastructure. Hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google are also expanding their use of NVIDIA’s full-stack systems..Competitors may offer lower-cost hardware, but replicating NVIDIA’s end-to-end solution remains a challenge. With software optimization, ongoing performance improvements and strong developer support, NVIDIA continues to strengthen its grip on the AI infrastructure market..In simple terms, NVIDIA is not just selling chips but building the foundation for the AI world with its networking and software tools. If this trend continues, it may become even harder for competitors to catch up..Two competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Some major cloud companies like Microsoft and Meta are testing AMD’s GPUs. However, Advanced Micro Devices does not yet offer a full-stack solution like NVIDIA. It lacks networking hardware and software tools at the same level as CUDA or NeMo..Intel is promoting its Gaudi 3 AI chips as a low-cost option for training and inference. However, Intel’s AI ecosystem is still developing, and its overall AI market share remains small. It also does not offer a complete package that ties chips, software and networking together..Both companies are making progress, but NVIDIA’s complete system gives it a strong lead..Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 15.1% year to date against the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s gain of 4.4%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ai-factory-buildouts-double-125000946.html,Competitive Risk

Palantir is an extraordinary company, but whether or not it can sustain a dotcom-esque premium once the pendulum swings the other way is yet to be seen..UnitedHealth (UNH) is about as far away as you can get from PLTR stock at the moment. The company missed its Q1 earnings, followed by multiple negative catalysts that have caused the stock price to nearly halve in 2025..However, UNH now sits at prices that are too good to ignore. The troubles UnitedHealth faces now aren’t likely to linger for years, so a rapid recovery could be in play if its management can start beating earnings estimates as usual and regulators continue being lenient.

As a result, you may expect this AI chip leader to come with a hefty price tag..But Nvidia actually is a bargain buy right now. Let's find out why..You may know Nvidia as the world's biggest seller of graphics processing units (GPUs), the high-powered chips that help AI models to train and go on to do their job of answering questions and solving problems. But Nvidia hasn't stopped with just chips and instead built out an entire portfolio of products and services to make itself almost indispensable for any company with AI aspirations..For example, Nvidia offers enterprise software and even platforms specific to certain industries such as automobiles and healthcare. The company also is set to benefit as users apply AI and need inferencing power or aim to better design AI agents. Nvidia is planning for future phases of growth, too, as it aims to drive the development of humanoid robots and even is exploring where AI and quantum computing may meet. The company recently said it would build a quantum computing research center in Boston, pairing quantum hardware with AI supercomputers..All of this shows Nvidia is well positioned to play a crucial role in AI -- and even quantum computing -- and benefit from a trillion-dollar market. Analysts say today's $300 billion AI market could reach $2 trillion a few years from now..This should add to an already impressive track record, as Nvidia has shown itself to be the star of the AI boom. Thanks to the top performance of its GPUs and related products, the company has delivered quarter after quarter of double- or triple-digit revenue growth well into the billions of dollars. Nvidia finished the latest fiscal year with triple-digit revenue gains to more than $130 billion, and in the recent period, the first fiscal quarter, revenue rose 69% to $44 billion..What's particularly impressive is Nvidia's ability to maintain high margins even during more costly times, such as product launches. For example, as it rolled out the new Blackwell architecture and chip in the fourth quarter, it maintained gross margin above 70%. And even as export controls on chip exports to China drove a $4.5 billion charge in the latest quarter, gross margin still came in at about 60% -- and excluding the charge met goals of the low 70% range.

It generated $981.6 million in revenue during its most recent quarter (which ended on March 31). Its top line rose by an incredible amount of 420%, as hyperscalers' demand for its computing power has been strong. It has some big-name customers, including Microsoft and OpenAI, which are investing billions into AI development..CoreWeave, which rents out computing capacity and access to Nvidia's latest chips, provides companies with a convenient way to test and develop AI technologies and models. However, the company doesn't purchase any new infrastructure (if it needs to) until it gets a signed contract, minimizing its overall risk..It focuses on helping businesses manage their AI workloads, and its close relationship with Nvidia enables it to offer prospective customers a key selling feature: Access to the latest and greatest AI chips..With hyperscalers continuing to invest heavily into AI and constantly needing more computing capacity, CoreWeave stands to benefit significantly from those trends, making it an attractive pure-play AI stock to buy and hold. Since going public in March, CoreWeave's stock has jumped by 345% (as of June 23)..Shares of Circle Internet Group have been flying since they went public in June. Entering trading on Tuesday, the stock was up an incredible 750%. The stablecoin issuer may provide investors with a relatively safe way to invest in crypto.

Read on..There are two primary AI workloads: Training, which involves feeding truckloads of data into AI models to make them ""smarter,"" and inference, which is the process by which AI models use that data to formulate responses or make predictions. These two workloads are processed in enormous data centers filled with thousands of GPUs, which cost billions of dollars to build..Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have the financial resources to build AI infrastructure to develop their own AI models. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle also build AI data centers and rent out the computing power to smaller developers for profit, which has become a very lucrative business practice because demand for capacity continues to far exceed supply..Here's how much money the top AI companies are spending on AI data centers overall at the moment, based on their public filings:.Amazon is allocating up to $105 billion to capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 alone, most of which will go toward AI data centers and GPUs..Microsoft's 2025 fiscal year will end on June 30, and the company is on track to have spent over $80 billion on AI infrastructure..Alphabet is forecasting AI capex spending of $75 billion in calendar year 2025..Meta Platforms originally planned to spend up to $65 billion to fuel its AI ambitions in 2025, but it recently raised the high end of its forecast to $72 billion..Oracle's 2025 fiscal year recently ended on May 31, and it spent $21.2 billion on AI infrastructure.

It's lost some investor confidence for a number of reasons, including fears that new artificial intelligence (AI) models won't need its powerful chips and regulations that limit what the company can ship to China..But many investors still see its incredible long-term opportunities, and 90% of the 67 Wall Street analysts that cover it still call it a buy. Let's see where Nvidia is holding, where it's going, and whether or not investing in Nvidia stock today can make you a millionaire..For all the talk about how much more Nvidia can grow, it delivered a blowout report for the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27). Revenue increased 69% year over year, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share were up from $0.61 last year to $0.81 this year. That included a charge it had to take for not being able to fulfill orders to China, resulting in a $0.15 loss per share. Nvidia is a profit machine with a 52% net profit margin..Nvidia is easily the leader in its field, with as much as 95% of the total AI chip market, depending on who you ask. It has deals with pretty much all the major players in AI, who rely on its powerful graphics processing units (GPU) to make the generative AI magic happen. The companies who are out there offering AI platforms, like Amazon and Meta Platforms, need huge data centers to create the power necessary to drive the technology, and they need Nvidia as a partner. Data centers are Nvidia's highest-growth business right now, increasing 73% year over year in the first quarter..Amazon, for one, is creating its own chips to offer budget options for some of its clients. However, it will maintain its relationship with Nvidia because it needs Nvidia's highest-quality products for its own largest clients..The market was concerned when Chinese LLM DeepSeek came out a few months ago, and it seemed to offer excellent results without needing the power of chips like Nvidia's.

The AI market, set to reach into the trillions of dollars in a few years, still is in its early stages, and today's most-watched players, such as Nvidia and software company Palantir Technologies, won't be the only ones to benefit..In fact, cloud company Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) could be a surprise winner of the AI revolution, and here's why..So, first, a little background on Oracle. The company has been around since the late 1970s and has become a leader in database management software. But Oracle didn't stand still and has since expanded into various areas, for example bringing its database to the cloud in 2013, and in more recent times, providing cloud infrastructure for AI customers..Over time, this has helped Oracle increase both annual revenue and net income into the billions of dollars -- and in recent years, both have taken off amid the AI boom..Customers come to Oracle for cloud capacity, and what sets this player apart is that it provides them with great flexibility. For example, Oracle offers a multicloud service that allows users the opportunity to simultaneously use services from various cloud providers together. Another option, Oracle Alloy, lets customers operate their own clouds for their customers..On top of this, Oracle also offers a full portfolio of AI-driven cloud applications to help with everything from supply chain management to customer relations..Now, let's consider the clues that suggest Oracle will be a surprise winner of the AI revolution. First, I'm saying ""surprise"" winner because Oracle hasn't been as much in the spotlight as the tech giants known as the Magnificent Seven. These players led market gains last year, and most are heavily present in the area of AI..Meanwhile, Oracle's AI business has been growing in leaps and bounds, pushing it into the league of those AI leaders. I'll use the recent quarter as an example. Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue soared 52% to $3 billion, and all other segments also generated double-digit growth..But one of the most encouraging figures of all is the remaining performance obligations (RPO), or the yet-to-be billed revenue coming from signed contracts -- it's important because it offers us visibility on revenue ahead. In the quarter, Oracle said RPO surged 41% to $138 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-cloud-company-surprise-winner-093500894.html,Speculative Risk

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position.","Apple's stock trades at a premium valuation despite putting up slow growth..Amazon's operating income growth is a vital metric..Alphabet is drastically undervalued for its performance..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position. Although it's still the third-largest company in the world, Microsoft and Nvidia have overtaken Apple, likely for good, as the growth these two are putting up far surpasses Apple's..However, I don't think we've seen the last of companies surpassing Apple in terms of market cap over the next few years. I think we'll see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surpass Apple by 2030. Several key factors play into this prediction, but Amazon's and Alphabet's performances aren't the only reason they'll surpass Apple..Apple's brand may be the most valuable on Earth, but that's about all it has going for it. Apple has posted anemic growth over the past few years, and it could be debated that Apple's growth has been essentially nonexistent when inflation is factored into the calculation..Despite that, Apple's stock trades like a hot growth stock, trading at 28 times forward earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 22.8 times forward earnings, with an average growth rate of about 10% per year. Apple's growth rate is far below that pace, so at most, Apple's stock should receive a market-average multiple, at least from my perspective..If Apple's valuation were to decline to a market-average multiple, it would tumble nearly 20%. That would put Apple's market cap at around $2.44 trillion, which is where we'll start our comparison..Currently, Amazon's market cap is $2.23 trillion and Alphabet's is $2.03 trillion. That's not far from the $2.44 trillion that I think Apple should be trading at, but even if Apple's stock stays at its elevated level, I think these two can catch Apple by 2030..Let's start with Amazon, whose growth rate looks rather slow at first glance, similar to Apple's..However, that's the wrong way to look at Amazon's stock. Amazon can be split into two businesses: commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing. While the consumer-facing commerce division is widely known and what most people value the stock for, the real cash cow is AWS. In the first quarter, AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating profits despite making up just 19% of revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has remained one of the most popular stocks in the market even after its unprecedented run-up since 2023.","Nvidia's growth may be slowing, but it's still rapid..Demand for AI computing hardware continues to increase..Nvidia would be nearly a $5 trillion company if it hits $200 per share..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has remained one of the most popular stocks in the market even after its unprecedented run-up since 2023. The demand for Nvidia's best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) hasn't let up because AI computing capacity hasn't come close to being fulfilled. There's plenty of upside left in the stock, but the next milestone is a $200 share price..Currently, Nvidia hovers around $145, but it has broken $150 before. This means the stock needs to rise about 40% to reach $200, but can it do that by the end of 2026?.A $200 share price would mean that it would have a market cap close to $5 trillion. There's never been a $4 trillion company, let alone a $5 trillion one. So if it hits $200 and continues to rise just a bit, it would make a record along the way..But that's what the stock has been about over the past few years. We've never seen a company of Nvidia's size grow as rapidly as it has, let alone sustain that growth over a three-year time span. In the 2026 fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), revenue rose 69% year over year to $44.1 billion, and second-quarter growth is expected to be about 50% year over year..This is all because of the vast demand it is experiencing. GPUs have become the computing hardware of choice for AI models, mainly due to their ability to handle intense workloads..They can process multiple calculations in parallel, and units can be combined in clusters to amplify that effect. This allows these data centers to train AI models on vast data sets that would take years for a traditional PC to process..Even though demand for Nvidia's GPUs is already high, it's expected to increase even more over the next few years. The AI hyperscalers have announced record spending for this year..But building a data center is a multiyear task. As a result, investors shouldn't be surprised if the AI hyperscalers announce further increases over this year's already elevated levels..This backs up a third-party projection management cited during its 2025 GTC event that data center capital expenditures were $400 billion in 2024 and are expected to increase to $1 trillion by 2028.

It's one of the main reasons why shares of CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) have been in fine form on the stock market in 2025..Both companies rent out AI-focused data centers powered by premium graphics processing units (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and others. To meet the increasing demand, both companies are quickly adding significant new data center capacity. The size of the cloud infrastructure market is expected to grow from around $178 billion this year to more than $1.1 trillion in 2033, with AI set to play a key role in this remarkable growth. Oracle and CoreWeave aim to help investors take advantage of this massive opportunity..Both stocks have real potential for outsized performance, but if you have to choose just one of these AI stocks, which one should you buy? Let's find out..Oracle's stock price is up 50% over the past 12 months, and it seems set for more upside going forward, given the impressive pace at which the demand for its cloud infrastructure is increasing. The company released its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended May 31) earlier this month, and it reported a solid 41% year-over-year increase in its remaining performance obligations (RPO) to a whopping $138 billion..RPO refers to the total value of a company's contracts yet to be fulfilled, which means that Oracle is sitting on a huge revenue pipeline that could help it grow at a much stronger pace following last year's top-line increase of 8% (totalling $57.4 billion). Not surprisingly, Oracle expects its revenue growth rate in fiscal 2026 to almost double..The company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment will play a central role in driving this acceleration as its revenue is expected to increase by 70% in fiscal 2026, following a 51% increase in fiscal 2025. What's more, Oracle management points out that it may be understating its RPO growth as the contracts from the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project are yet to reflect in its revenue pipeline.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-085500773.html,no risk

New terms like ""sovereign AI"" and ""AI factories"" are being splashed all over business news sites. But what do they really mean?.For investors, one thing they should mean is that Nvidia remains the one stock to buy to take advantage of global AI growth. The company has been the leader in selling the hardware needed to support massive compute power being tapped to develop and train large language models (LLMs). But there is much more to the AI ecosystem that Nvidia is already tapping into that will become its next catalyst for growth..AI factories are what Jensen Huang calls specialized data center facilities designed to develop, train, and deploy AI models at scale. He has been traveling the globe to promote Nvidia's leading role in scaling up these Blackwell-powered factories. Nvidia will also be following its Blackwell GPU architecture with the next-generation Rubin platform in 2026..These Nvidia component-based systems will support sovereign nation digital advancements around the world. These include the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) massive Stargate data center campus, Germany's sovereign AI factory run by telecom giant Deutsche Telekom, and European data center projects being developed by other nations. At a recent Paris tech summit, Huang summarized how the continent is scaling AI solutions, stating, ""We now have a new industry, an AI industry, and it's now part of the new infrastructure, called intelligence infrastructure, that will be used by every country, every society."".Nvidia will be a major benefactor of this expanding infrastructure. Its powerful GPU clusters, software infrastructure, and networking solutions will all be prominent in many of these large data centers..That's the reason I think Nvidia's growth will continue, and its stock should respond in turn.

But what you might be surprised to learn is that this highly influential AI company has scored a $4 billion ""profit"" in an uncharacteristic manner..It took less than two years for Nvidia to catapult from a $360 billion market cap to (briefly) the world's largest public company, with a valuation that handily surpassed $3.5 trillion. A $3 trillion-plus increase in valuation in such a short time frame had never been witnessed before..Nvidia's claim to fame is its Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the undisputed top options deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. Orders for both chips have been extensively backlogged, despite the efforts of world-leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to boost its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate monthly wafer capacity..When demand for a good or service outstrips its supply, the law of supply and-demand states that prices will climb until demand tapers. Whereas direct rival Advanced Micro Devices was netting anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000 for its Instinct MI300X AI-accelerating chip early last year, Nvidia's Hopper chips were commanding a price point that topped $40,000. The ability to charge a premium for its AI hardware, due to a combination of strong demand and persistent AI-GPU scarcity, helped push Nvidia's gross margin into the 70% range.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-titan-nvidia-075100674.html,no risk

The cost of hedging swings has surged this year, with one-year implied volatility for the local currency hitting the highest since 2011 on Wednesday..“Generally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,” said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco based in Singapore. “Issuing new shares, and bringing in an immediate cash injection, may help companies manage the margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.”.“The US dollar cash can also be useful for companies’ overseas operations, which could also require consistent hedging,” McNicholas added..TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far the island’s biggest company and exporter because the majority of its production is domestic. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would translate into less of the local currency, or they would need to raise their prices overseas and risk denting demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html,Market Risk

(NVDA) surged to a new all-time high on Wednesday, breaking out of a months-long trading range after a bullish analyst upgrade..The stock closed at $154.31, topping its previous record closing high of $149.43 set in January. Nvidia shares have spent most of the past year consolidating between $100 and $150, but the breakout suggests renewed investor enthusiasm as the AI boom shows no signs of slowing and as Nvidia continues to dominate the market for AI chips..Fueling Wednesday’s rally was a dramatic upgrade from Loop Capital Markets analyst Ananda Baruah, who raised their price target on the stock from $175 to $250, the highest target among Wall Street analysts. Overall, sentiment on the stock remains overwhelmingly positive: 87% of analysts covering Nvidia rate it a ""Buy,"" with an average 12-month price target of $173..Nvidia designs GPUs, the critical hardware used to train and run artificial intelligence models like those powering ChatGPT. While the stock has seen its share of volatility in recent months—driven by concerns over U.S. trade restrictions, competitive threats and the sustainability of AI demand—those risks have yet to meaningfully dent Nvidia’s position atop the AI world..Major customers like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) continue to invest heavily in Nvidia’s chips, even as they create in-house alternatives..Nvidia is now the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion, just ahead of Microsoft's $3.7 trillion. That lofty valuation means Nvidia has an outsized footprint in many major ETFs..It now accounts for over 7% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and nearly 9% of the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). It also dominates sector-specific funds like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), where it represents 20% of the portfolio..Leveraged products tied to the stock have also been popular. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of Nvidia shares, has amassed $3.8 billion in assets. Still, NVDL remains more than 20% below its highs due to the effects of compounding and daily reset mechanics inherent to leveraged ETFs...Permalink | © Copyright 2025 etf.com.

The Dow slipped 106 points, -0.25%, while the S&P 500 was exactly unched — 0.0% — on the day. The Nasdaq gained +61 points, +0.31%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 closed at session lows: -0.99%.The morning-hours catalyst may have been Fed Chair Jerome Powell today, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the possibility of cutting interest rates. Yesterday, Powell energized markets somewhat when he told the House Financial Services that the Fed could cut rates “sooner than later,” but today he predicted inflation coming from tariff policy in the coming months. “Someone has to pay,” he told the panel.Yet the Nasdaq is approaching fresh all-time highs not seen since February, as the AI-trade narrative has kept top tech stocks buoyant. Take NVIDIA NVDA, for instance, which is up nearly +64% just since its early April lows during trade war fears before reciprocal tariffs were paused for 90 days. Shares are now at record highs as AI investment reported by companies in various industries are engaged in the technological buildout for which NVIDIA leads in component-building..Fiscal Q3 earnings were released after today’s close from data storage giant Micron MU. This company is a good example of how AI investment bolsters companies in this realm of the tech space, as well. Earnings of $1.68 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by 9 cents, up a whopping +171% year over year. Revenues of $9.30 billion easily surpassed the $8.84 billion analysts were looking for.Bot only that, but Micron raised guidance fairly significantly for its fiscal Q4: earnings of between $2.35-2.65 per share is well ahead of the $2.02 consensus, with between $10.4-11.0 billion in revenues far beyond the $9.9 billion previously projected. As such, expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-based stock to ratchet up a bit in the days to come. Shares had already been up +51.2% year to date, and are up another +4% in late trading. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here. https://www.zacks.com/earnings/earnings-calendar)..We have a full plate of economic reports before tomorrow’s opening bell, with a new Trade Balance in Goods, Retail/Wholesale Inventories, Durable Goods and Pending Home Sales all accompanying the second revision to Q1 GDP. But what we’ll be paying extra close attention to tomorrow are the Weekly Jobless Claims.Initial Jobless Claims touched 250K a couple weeks ago, second only to the 259K reported back in early October of last year (which appears like an anomalous blip on the screen). They came back down to 245K in last week’s report, and we hope to see this continue downward.Continuing Claims, reported a week in arrears from new claims, clearly look they are breaking out to new levels. After spending much of 2025 chopping back and forth between 1.85-1.9 million, the past two weeks have shot up to a new range around 1.95 million. If this comes back down we won’t make too much of it. But touching that 2 million level on longer-term jobless claims will have a psychological effect on markets — and perhaps the Fed as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Although revenue was up 10% from the year-ago period, the majority of those gains stemmed from the acquisition of human capital management, or HCM, software firm Paycor, which closed in April. Paychex also provided full-year sales and profit guidance that came in below consensus estimates. Shares of fellow HCM software providers Paycom (PAYC), Dayforce (DAY) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) were all down more than 4%..Cereal maker General Mills (GIS) missed fiscal fourth-quarter sales estimates and projected a larger-than-anticipated profit decline in fiscal 2026, and its shares fell 5.1%.

Now cements the company as one of the most valuable companies in the world. That stock grows about 4% to 15431. The record is only the latest milestone for the company has risen more than 60% off an April low. Recent earnings, strong sales were catalyst for bullish sentiment for the tech darling, but today's gains Nvidia stands as the world's largest stock. It was interesting, Mark, we were talking earlier the team at Loop Capital, they put out a note, maintain their buy, they took the target at 250 per Bloomberg. That's a street high, and they told their clients, Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and it has pricing and margin power. I'm curious though when you look at the charts of Nvidia, what do the technicals tell you? .Well, it's a new all-time high. It's very difficult to sell a stock like that. I mean, it's up 28% in the last three months, and actually, that's more than it's been up in the last year. So people were called the stock peaked out last summer and went sideways for a period of time, and that's a lot of these, you know, mag 7 fang stocks do, and then when they start to ascend again and break out to new highs, it generally pays to follow that move. And so, you know, my technical target is right around 165 and then 180. 250 for me would be aggressive, but I do sense that it can continue likely up into the month of August. Uh the fall might be a time when when generally market, you know, we might do we see some consolidation, but uh I don't see it yet. I I see that Nvidia is able to power the semiconductor sector. Now we have great results out of Micron, of course, what we discussed earlier, and AMD, they're all you know, surging in a way that really makes semis quite attractive here, and and I still love technology, so uh it's right to stick with it. .All right, quite attractive.

Josh Shafer is here with me as well as Mark Newton, fundstrat global advisor, managing director, and global head of technical strategy. So markets, looking at the popular average here, looks like we're in mix. The Dow is going to finish down about 90 points. The S&P 500 looking unchanged, flat at 6092. I have the Nasdaq up about three tenths of a percent. Joshua, over to you from Morgan where the markets closed. .Yeah, Josh. So, as you mentioned, not a ton of action in your major averages. And there really wasn't even a ton of movement when you look at just this intraday of the S&P 500. I think at the peak of the day, we were maybe up 0.2%. So really, markets didn't even move that much at the index level either. Couple other things I want to hit on, Josh, that we had sort of been following over the last couple days. So the 10-year T note, we had been talking about, right? Of course, that had been on a recent decline. Did not move much today. Then I'm going to flip over to Bitcoin. Let's take a look at how Bitcoin did on the day. Bitcoin up slightly over 107,000 a coin right now. And then also looking over at oil. Oil ticked up a little bit today. We had been following a pretty big decrease in oil over the last two days, right? If I flip this to a three day, that had sort of been the story of the market to start the week was oil lower, stocks up. But the big news, I think in a world where we didn't have too much move today, Nvidia. We had Nvidia hit a record close today for the first time since, I believe, it was January. So one of the first record closes for Nvidia of the year. And if you just flip out over the last month or the last three months, stock's been on a pretty good run off the bottom, right? So this was sort of your April low off the tariff news. Nvidia fell with the rest of the market. Stock has been looking pretty good and now hitting a new all-time high. I will also call out just broadly the semis have been doing pretty well. So if you look at the chip sector and then take a look at a three day here, we had a decent rally in semis yesterday. You can see Broadcom is up 6% over the last three days. AMD up 12% over the last three days. So decent action there. And then I'll just close out here with the sectors on the day and get your out performers. Outperformer on the day was once again tech. Had healthcare a little bit, slight outperformance, I guess we could call it, but really another tech driven day in markets. .All right. Thank you, Josh. Mark, I also want to get your take here. Give me the technical take, Mark, on today's action. What do you see? .Well, the biggest development, I think, was Nvidia hitting new all-time highs. I mean, it's 7% of the S&P, and certainly a big move. A lot of people thought it might stall out near that 153 level, and to get above that in my view is going to be positive in the days to come for both S&P and QQQ. So, uh, it's really about the move this week less than today. We saw a really good movement this week out of the financials, and the week being only Wednesday. So it's really been Monday, Tuesday. Remarkable outperformance in the last couple days out of Industrials, Financials, Transportation, and Consumer Discretionary. All sectors that had lagged into Monday of this week over the last month. Eight out of 11 sectors were down over the last month. Some to the extent almost two to three percent when you look at financials, industrials. That has all changed, folks, this week. So a very, very good recovery, very good signs out of that, a broadening out in this rally. Uh, many people get skeptical as indices hit new all-time highs, but honestly, that's the time you really got to pay attention. Sentiment remains offsides, and that's a key message. Until we see all these CTAs and hedge funds really start to pour money back into the market, uh, trends look great. The economy is good. Earnings are good.

Examples include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) using AI for up to 30% of its coding work, and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) handling 80% of its customer support through AI tools..Despite broader macro risks, including potential semiconductor tariffs and tensions in the Middle East, UBS said structural drivers of AI remain intact and should underpin further gains for tech stocks. The Nasdaq 100 hit a record high on Tuesday, helped by easing geopolitical concerns..UBS expects global AI capital spending to rise 33% in 2026 to $480 billion after surging 60% this year. The bank forecasts 12% earnings growth for the global tech sector in 2025, aided in part by continued dollar weakness that benefits U.S. tech firms with overseas sales..The bank recommended a balanced approach across the AI value chain, including semiconductor suppliers, software companies and private-market exposure to emerging AI platforms..Related articles.Tech rally has legs amid rising AI adoption, says UBS.Shell denies that it’s pursuing a bid for BP, says no talks underway; stock up.Worldline shares regain some losses after report sparks steep drop on Wednesday",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-rally-legs-amid-rising-200305970.html,no risk

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) flirted with its own all-time highs but ended the trading day nearly flat, just below its record level. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (^DJI) slipped about 0.3%, falling just over 100 points..Stocks lost steam as Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in his second day of congressional testimony. He tangled with Republican senators amid pressure from the GOP side, most prominently from Trump himself, to cut rates..Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation from tariffs is still an open question, noting the central bank is closely watching upcoming economic data to assess the impact on monetary policy..""There will be some inflation from tariffs coming, not yet, but over the course of the coming months,"" Powell said..Markets responded positively to Powell's prior day testimony, where he hinted that rate cuts could come ""sooner rather than later."".His remarks set the stage for Friday’s closely watched release of the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which investors will scrutinize for clues on the future path of monetary policy..Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which strips out volatile food and energy costs — to have ticked up in May, compared with April. But scrutiny will also fall on any signs that Trump's tariffs pushed prices higher..Investors are also keeping a close eye on the US-brokered Middle East truce, which appears to be holding. There have been no reported strikes between Israel and Iran since Trump lambasted both for breaching an agreement to pause hostilities to give room for diplomacy.

The new price target suggests Nvidia's market cap could soar to $6 trillion from its current $3.6 trillion level..""While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,"" Baruah wrote in a note to clients, adding that Loop Capital analysts see the market for AI chips growing to $2 trillion in 2028..To be sure, questions remain over whether AI infrastructure demand will continue to rise, as Big Tech companies rake in far less revenue than they're spending to build the tech..Read more here. .The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near record highs, which means a familiar talking point is also back in the market discussion..The S&P 500's valuation is back above both the five- and 10-year averages. This is often used as a way to describe stocks as ""expensive."" But as we've pointed out in the past, just because valuations are high doesn't mean they can't stay high for an extended period of time. .It also doesn't mean they can't keep moving higher. The chart below from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaro shows that when splitting the S&P 500 into deciles organized by least and most expensive, the current market is far less expensive than the peak of the 2021 stock boom..For instance, the average stock in the most expensive bucket is trading at a 63 times forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, well below the 104 times forward earnings seen back in 2021..""Price earnings multiples are a function of investor confidence, which is a constantly moving target and has very little in the way of natural limits on either the upside or downside,"" DataTrek co-Founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday..The Technology sector (XLK) is the only sector in the green on Wednesday, extending a recent strong stretch for the sector..Wednesday's action is headlined by a 4% Nvidia rise in Nvidia (NVDA), but over the past month, the tech trade has been about much more than the ""Magnificent Seven."".The technology sector has actually outperformed both the S&P 500 and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which includes Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA)..Inside the technology sector, other names have been leading with Oracle (ORCL) and Micron (MU) at the top of the list, rising 36% over the past month..In his second day of testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell again said that President Trump's tariffs could fuel inflation, arguing the central bank is in good position to ""wait"" and see their effects..Though Powell said ""inflation's in a really good place,"" he added that ""there will be some inflation from tariffs coming, not yet, but over the course of the coming months."".""And I think it is reasonable to expect that because someone has to pay,"" he said. ""This is hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs we're taking in. Some of that's going to fall on the consumer."".The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pulled back from slight gains, down just over 0.1%.

In March, the stock dropped after Campbell's cut its full year outlook, citing softer demand for its snack brands, which include Goldfish and Kettle chips..On Tuesday, the company's largest shareholder, Mary Alice Dorrance Malone, passed away at the age of 75..Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a report Wednesday that artificial intelligence could boost the AI data center market to $823 billion by 2030, up from $256 billion in 2025..“We expect every major country/region to invest in creating its independent 'sovereign' AI factory, trained in local language, culture, generating high-tech employment, and serving critical healthcare, defense, industrial, financial and cyber needs,” Arya wrote..Some $650 billion of that market would go to AI chips alone, up from $201 billion in 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to be a “key beneficiary” as it’s “still far ahead” of new entrants in the sector, Arya said..To be sure, tech companies are still in the process of figuring out how to monetize AI and are raking in far less revenue than they’re spending to build the tech..For example, a separate analysis from Bank of America on Monday showed that Google’s AI subscriptions are set to drive $4.2 billion in subscription revenue within its Google Cloud segment in 2025. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) has said it will spend $75 billion in 2025, driven by its investments in AI..BP (BP) stock soared as much as 8% on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported the British oil giant is in early talks to be acquired by its European rival Shell (SHEL)..According to the report, an agreement would mark a landmark deal between the two energy super majors, valued at $80 billion..BP stock pared gains to rise 1.% after a Shell spokesperson said, “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.”.BP declined to comment on the report..Earlier this year, the company announced it would increase oil and gas investments and target divestments to support a stronger balance sheet as the company pivoted its focus back to its core business of oil and gas while lowering spending on renewables..Over the past year, BP came under increasing activist investor pressure to put profits before climate initiatives..Micron (MU) stock dipped 1.7% ahead of the chipmaker’s third quarter earnings report, which is scheduled to be released after the bell Wednesday. Despite the modest decline, the stock is up 50% for the year..Micron sells its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) to use within graphics processing units in AI data centers. It also sells other kinds of memory chips that firms like Apple (AAPL) use in consumer electronics..“HBM demand trends remain robust with strong visibility and AI capital expenditure spending,” JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in an earnings preview June 20 of the company, maintaining his Overweight rating on Micron stock..Wall Street analysts expect Micron to report earnings per share of $1.60 for its third quarter, up 158% from the previous year, and revenue of $8.85 billion, a roughly 30% jump from the year-ago period..Two weeks ago, Micron joined a slew of tech companies bolstering their investment in US manufacturing amid broader pressure on the sector from President Trump. Micron said it will invest an additional $30 billion in the US as it looks to build out its manufacturing and research and development facilities in Idaho and New York, bringing its total US manufacturing and R&D investments up to roughly $200 billion,.Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul and Jennifer Schonberger reports:.President Trump told reporters that he is actively considering replacements for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and that he is down to three or four candidates..""I know within 3 or 4 people who I’m going to pick,"" he told reporters adding of Powell ""he goes up pretty soon fortunately because I think he's terrible."" Powell’s term as chair expires in May 2026..The comments from the president during a press conference in the Netherlands came at the same time as Powell sat before Senate lawmakers about 3,800 miles away in Washington for his second day of regularly scheduled testimony before Congress..The consideration of Powell successors comes after a period of intensifying pressure from Trump to consider rate cuts as the chairman’s guarded wait-and-see monetary policy stance continues to inflame tensions with the White House..Trump’s comments on Wednesday didn’t address the question of whether he is looking to fire Powell or announce his final pick quickly in part to undercut Powell’s authority for the remainder of his term..Read more here..Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday as its sales in the European Union fell for a fifth-straight month. .In May, Tesla's new EU car registrations, a proxy for vehicle sales, tumbled 41% compared to the prior year..This pushed shares of the EV maker lower despite a broader tech rally that included rises in each of the other ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks.

The stock is up 40% for the month through Tuesday's trading session, and Wednesday's rise would add to that climb..Part of that upswing came as the company launched new AI tools at the Cannes Lions festival and after a recent analysis showed that Reddit is the second-most-cited website in Google (GOOG, GOOGL) AI overviews..Despite Reddit stock's climb this week, shares are still down nearly 14% for the year. The social media stock has suffered as changes to Google's Search algorithm have spurred ongoing concerns among investors over its user traffic..Citing an industry contact, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said that ""spend on Reddit is expected to grow as brands recognize the importance of maintaining a presence on the platform,"" especially as AI models impact advertisers by reducing Search traffic to websites..Erickson, who maintained his Sector Perform rating on the stock, also noted that Reddit is cracking down on multiple users using the same account, which could be a ""tailwind"" for traffic..Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a note to clients on June 18 that Reddit has ""a viable strategy to reduce the current top-of-funnel user volatility,"" as ""there appears to be a renewed push to diversify user acquisition channels to platforms beyond Google.""

We're watching shares of Shell, BP and Nvidia starting off with Shell, which is denying reports now from the Wall Street Journal that it's in talks to acquire BP. Julie, let's start with you on this one. You've been following, I know this story closely. .Yes, I have. And Shell is pushing back pretty forcefully against this report, which, according to the journal, said that the two were in early stage talks that might not result in a deal, but Shell in a statement to Yahoo Finance says this is further market speculation. No talks are taking place. They go on to say, as we've said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value and shell through continuing to focus on performance discipline and simplification. BP, for its part, offered no comment on this. This would be an enormous deal if it was to go through, and it was to happen. BP's market cap around $82 billion, Shell's at $210 billion. And BP really has been struggling to some extent over the past couple of years through a change in leadership, through activist investment from Elliott Management, which has been pushing for changes at the company. And I was looking at the five year performance here. BP over the past five years it is up, it's up about 29%, but Shell in that time has more than doubled. Um, so you see here and remember also that BP kind of went for from pivoting towards what it branded itself as beyond petroleum, right? Pivoting into some more renewable energy sources. And then while its competitors, including Shell, were not, and then had to kind of pivot back to its bread and butter oil and gas business. So again, Shell denying the report, but interesting as we kind of look at BP's business here. .You know, it's interesting, Mark, cause I I know there have been reports, including Bloomberg, I think back in May said Shell had been considering the merits of this one. But what do you make of the headline? .Well, look, BP has obviously underperformed over the last decade, and if anything, this might be a perfect time to consider, uh, you know, some sort of a move like this sort. I mean, crude oil has been in a three year bear market. And now all of a sudden, with the geopolitical uptick and start of wars, uh, we see a quick 20 point move and crude over the last few weeks. And so, it, you know, my thinking is that energy is slowly but surely in the process of likely bottoming out after severe underperformance. So if we see crude higher in the back half of the year, uh, it's going to make perfect sense to try to do a deal like this at a time when BP could be, you know, undervalued compared to its worth. And then, you know, as as we start to see the energy market recover, uh, you know, be a perfectly well timed, uh, time to do this strategy in my view. .Let's move on. Check out Nvidia as well. It's hosting its annual shareholder meeting today with a new all time closing price knocking at the door here. Chip giant also received the street high price target upgrade from Loop Capital. Now see the stock reaching 250 analysts. They are talking about the next golden wave of gen AI adoption. They say Nvidia is at the front end of another material leg, stronger than anticipated demand similar to, they say, to 23 and 24. Nvidia's market cap could run to $6 trillion, Julie. .Yeah. So obviously this is a very bullish call out from Loop Capital. By the way, Nvidia is there. It's at that record high. If it were going to close at this moment, it would be a new record close and it seems like it's pretty comfortably there here. So, um, Ananda Baru over there at Loop Capital, the latest to come in here, um, with this kind of $6 trillion math or these big trillion dollar numbers, um, that we've heard from other analysts as well. Basically, they're talking about the spending cycle that we are seeing from hyperscale and what they call AI factory companies, sovereign AI, for example, that they say gen AI and AI accelerated compute spending alone could get to $2 trillion by 2028 using current compute economics. So it's interesting to see that move in Nvidia. What I also think is interesting is that what we have seen, what we've been seeing in the other chips, not just Nvidia, uh, if you look at even the semiconductor ETF SMH here, it's up now about 12% year to date. It has outpaced software, it has outpaced internet, uh, tracked by other ETFs, IGB and FDN. This was flagged by Jordan Klein of Mizuho in a note this morning. And what he also flagged is it's not Nvidia that has taken the chips there. Yes, Nvidia has climbed a lot from its lows this year and is near that record high. But if you look at the best performers this year, it's some of the chip equipment makers like a KLA tencor and it's Micron, uh, which has done very well year to date, um, and since the lows. So, uh, it's interesting this again, I know I mentioned this earlier, the broadening. Yes, it's still Nvidia, but it's Nvidia and now when it comes to this chip and AI trade. .You know, it's interesting, Mark. I'm just reading Luke Capital here, saying Nvidia remains in their words, essentially, it's a monopoly for critical tech, and it has pricing and margin power. .Yeah, it continues to be probably the most important, uh, company within the semiconductor space, has achieved dramatic outperformance, uh, now set to make a new all time closing high. Uh, to Julie's point, look, we have seen some other important semiconductor companies also making remarkable headway, uh, from those April lows. Stocks like AMD, uh, Micron Technology, which we're expecting earnings from, of course, uh, later today. And so those are going to be really important. Semiconductors have snapped back, and that's been really, really important for tech. And I think it's generally a very bullish sign for, you know, the market as a whole.

According to Economic Daily and Commercial Time, NVIDIA has reportedly secured the entire production capacity of Wistron’s newly launched AI server plant in Zhubei, Taiwan, through 2026. The move is aimed at meeting the surging demand for NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems..The Wistron facility is located in the Southern Taiwan Science Park and officially began operations with an inauguration on June 19. While specific production capacity figures for this single plant are not publicly known, Wistron’s collective 7 plants, employing over 7,000 people, are estimated to produce ~240,000 Blackwell-based AI systems per quarter..A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer..Due to the rapid growth in demand, Wistron has warned that its current capacity may not be sufficient by 2026. To proactively address this, the company has secured an adjacent building from Lianfa Textile, designated as a second AI server site (A2) in Zhubei. The new site is scheduled to commence operations in 2026 and will also be dedicated to building NVIDIA-based servers, which is expected to effectively double Wistron’s Taiwan-based AI server output once both facilities are fully operational..NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that provides graphics and compute & networking solutions internationally..While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

It is the stock’s first new high since January..Loop Capital raised its price target to a Street-high $250 per share, implying a staggering $6 trillion market valuation..In the report, Loop analyst Ananda Baruah wrote that the firm’s research indicates “we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption,” with NVIDIA positioned “at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand.”.Baruah estimates that spending on Gen AI and AI Accelerator compute—from Hyperscalers, Sovereign AI efforts, Neocloud providers, and Enterprises—could climb to $2 trillion by 2028, based on current compute economics..Loop also noted that Hyperscalers are increasingly shifting away from CPU-based compute, targeting 50–60% of total installed compute to be non-CPU by the end of the cycle, up from just 12% at the start of this year..Additionally, the firm notes that NVIDIA’s next-gen Blackwell chips are expected to reach full production volume by the October quarter. Reasoning models, they added, are proving far more token-intensive than previously realized, while inferencing and AI factory demand are ramping up quickly..Baruah’s $250 price target is based on a 31x multiple of their FY 2028 EPS estimates of $8.00..Related articles.NVIDIA surges to all-time high as analyst sees $6 trillion market cap.GXO launches AI-powered platform to transform logistics operations.Exclusive: Recent IPO AIRO completes 90-day training mission for Navy special ops",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-surges-time-high-analyst-192537564.html,Market risk

For this, today's power player, I am locked in on Hewlett Packard Enterprises. Company is holding its annual Discover event in Vegas to show off its latest technologies to customers, especially on the AI front. HPE CEO Antonio Neri is here with me now from the event. Antonio, always great to see with see you. Don't know how you made time for me, but I appreciate it nonetheless. Out of all the announcements that you have come out with here, uh, from Discover, the announcement with Nvidia and AI factories really caught my attention. Why is that such a big thing for HPE's bottom line? .Well, good morning, Brian, and thanks again for having me. What a great week for us here at HP Discover Vegas. I'm standing here on the show floor. It's a seven acres of technology on display. And after a great day yesterday at the sphere, where I gave my keynote. But to your point, yesterday we made a number of very strategic announcements. One of them, obviously, was the expansion of our AI factories with Nvidia. We continue to have a terrific partnership with Nvidia, expanding our solutions for sovereigns, which is an area where we see tremendous interest and growth. Obviously, the continued capex investment in service providers, as well as the continuation of the model builders. And then enterprise. And enterprise here, we have more than 12,000 customers visiting us this week. And they're all interesting to accelerate their journey to AI. And that tells you the interest is super, super high. And that's with Nvidia, we have co-architect, the co-engineered a solution that's easy to deploy it for time to value. .Antonio, um, Keybank out with a good report here today. They surveyed a lot of CIOs who are out there buying tech. Um, they are noting the slowest IT spending growth outlook since 2020. How is that starting to take shape in your business? .Well, look, we don't see a slowdown in IT spend. Uh, in fact, if you really follow the last few quarters of continuous revenue growth, you see that the momentum is across all line of businesses. Look, to deploy AI, continue your journey to a hybrid cloud experience across your enterprise, you need more networking. And so, networking has clearly recovered in the market. And we see that in our growth in our orders, and now in our revenue. Uh, GreenLake has been positioned extremely successful to be that bridge to provide a hybrid experience. And we continue to grow on an average of 35 to 45%. And this week, we announced the agentive approach to our GreenLake cloud. And what they're very interested is using GreenLake as an intelligence, meaning we can bring to them an army of AI agentive kind of capabilities, so they can remove people that are in the loop and put them on the loop. And so those actions can be taken by AI. So, I haven't seen that, honestly, Brian, but obviously there is a lot of uncertainty in the market. There's always geopolitical tension, but I think we'll continue to be a top of mind for enterprises. .And Tony, before we let you go, and I know you're busy guy at this conference, um, July 9th is the Juniper trial. Would you assign any probability to this, I guess this trial not actually happening, that the government drops its case and lets you take battle versus Cisco in this market? .Well, look, everything is possible. We continue to work to try to work a remediation sort of settlement, but fact of the matter is that we are so close to the trial. Our view is that we believe this is pro competitive, we believe this is good for enterprises. Remember, we don't support consumers. And ultimately, we believe we will prevail in court if we have to go all the way there. .All right, we'll leave it there, Antonio Neri. Good to see you, as always. Good to see that HP stock symbol behind you at the conference. I'm digging it. Put something on black for me in Vegas. We'll talk to you soon. .We'll do. Thank you.

Spending on AI computing gear has sent investors hunting for beneficiaries beyond marquee stocks like Nvidia Corp..Micron’s growth is being fueled by high-bandwidth memory — bundles of dynamic random access memory chips closely connected to processors from Nvidia — which is vital to AI computing. That’s helped drive up prices as supply remains constrained due to the complexity of producing and deploying such components..“Micron isn’t the star of AI, the way Nvidia is, but high-bandwidth memory chips are the gold standard for powering AI, and the demand for them is insatiable,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. Micron shares were about 0.5% lower at 1:30 p.m. in New York..The Boise, Idaho-based company is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 on revenue of about $8.9 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be an increase of 158% and 30% from the same period a year ago, respectively..“Pricing and availability of Micron’s high-bandwidth memory will be a central focus,” said Jake Behan, head of capital markets at Direxion. “Investors will be looking for clarity on production, supply constraints, and how well-positioned Micron is to meet hyperscaler and AI customer demand.”.Profitability will also be top of mind for investors after gross margins fell short of Wall Street expectations in the second quarter. Analysts at NewStreet Research are anticipating a recovery in DRAM and NAND gross margins, which would help Micron beat expectations..Adjusted gross margins are projected to be 36.8% in the third quarter, down from 37.9% in the previous quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates..Of course, anything short of a stellar report could trigger a selloff considering the magnitude of the stock’s gains.

He noted that networking solutions, a part of HPE's core offerings, are needed to deploy more AI and cloud applications..""We see that growth in our orders, and now in our revenue,"" he added..Neri also pointed to continued growth in enterprise demand, particularly around AI and hybrid cloud services. He highlighted HPE's deepening partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) to expand so-called AI factories — infrastructure needed to build, deploy, and scale AI models — as a key driver for growth..But the view from CIOs may be more cautious. According to a new report from KeyBanc Capital Markets, IT budget expectations have slipped. The firm now forecasts IT budgets to grow just 2.7% in 2025, down from 3.9% at the start of the year. If that holds, it would mark the slowest IT budget growth period since 2020..The firm noted broader restraint in the sector. Software vendors are seeing increased scrutiny, and IT hiring plans have scaled back. Major tech employers like Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Salesforce (CRM) have reduced headcounts following a post-pandemic hiring spree. In March, HPE announced a cost-cutting plan targeting $350 million in savings by 2027, primarily through workforce reductions..Tariff-related uncertainty has also weighed on IT. While KeyBanc initially expected 33% of CIOs to say they are being impacted, 42% now report a negative effect. Still, only 19% said they’ve delayed spending, suggesting companies are cautious but not pulling back entirely..HPE beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal second quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 6% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, down 10% year over year. Its intelligent edge segment, which includes networking, had a 7% jump in revenue compared to the prior year, and the hybrid cloud segment grew 13%..The company's pressured server business was responsible for the bulk of its sales at $4.1 billion, a 6% increase over the prior year..Meanwhile, HPE is facing a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its proposed $14 billion Juniper Networks (JNPR) acquisition, with a trial set to begin on July 9.

Even though many stocks involved in artificial intelligence (AI) have been hot buys, Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, has been lagging behind..Over the past 12 months, shares of AMD are down 20%, while Nvidia's have risen by around 14% (as of June 23). And if you stretch out the time frame even further, the difference becomes wider..AMD was a bit late in launching AI accelerators, but it may finally be closing the hardware performance gap and possibly even catching up to Nvidia. It recently announced its latest AI chips, and one person who is excited about them is none other than OpenAI CEO Sam Altman..AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Instinct MI400 line of chips a few weeks ago. They'll start shipping to customers next year. The chips can be tied together in a rack solution called ""Helios,"" which Su says ""functions like a single, massive compute engine."" OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, will use the new chips, and Altman is excited about their potential. ""It's gonna be an amazing thing."".The hope at AMD is that these new chips will take some market share from Nvidia, which has been far and away the leading AI chipmaker in the market thus far. With the MI400s earning a favorable endorsement from Altman, and considering AMD's plans to price them aggressively, faster growth could be ahead for the chipmaker..In recent quarters, AMD's results have been looking better and its growth rate has started to accelerate again..If its growth rate can remain strong, that could attract the types of AI investors who are specifically seeking out riskier stocks with lots of upside potential. AMD's valuation of $210 billion is just a fraction of Nvidia's $3.5 billion market cap. But while Nvidia has been a beast in the AI sphere, investors today may be wondering just how much higher it can go given that it's already among the three most valuable companies in the world. This is where AMD may be a more compelling option.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amds-ai-chips-just-got-170000368.html,no risk

On June 20, TerraPower—a nuclear energy startup founded by Bill Gates—announced a $650 million funding round to support construction of its first commercial power plant in Wyoming..Backers include existing investors like Gates and HD Hyundai, alongside Nvidia’s NVentures, which marked its first step into the energy sector. Though regulatory approvals are still pending, the company expects a green light next year. The new Natrium reactor aims to deliver 345 megawatts of electricity, blending the scale of traditional reactors with the flexibility of emerging small modular designs..What sets Natrium apart is its molten sodium cooling system, enabling continuous operation even when electricity demand is low. Excess heat is stored and later used to meet spikes in demand, helping bridge gaps in solar and wind energy. TerraPower shifted to this design after scrapping an earlier plan and says it can complete a reactor within three years of the concrete pour. However, total costs could hit $4 billion, with the U.S. Department of Energy potentially covering half. Despite the price tag, Natrium could signal a new, more adaptable era for nuclear power..NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in computing and AI infrastructure, offering platforms like DRIVE, Jetson, and DGX Cloud for data centers, robotics, and autonomous systems. Its Graphics segment powers gaming and professional visualization with GeForce and RTX GPUs, along with Omniverse for industrial AI, serving industries from entertainment to automotive through a vast network of partners and providers..While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

It's a pretty resilient basket case, right? I agree, you know, policy making has been .Is that even possible? What is a resilient basket case? Well, I guess it makes sense. .Exactly. No, I I I I'm respectfully trying to push back on that because I I really do think that the resiliency underlying the fundamentals has been there and that's why you know, you've had retail guys getting off the sidelines, putting their cash to work when you see um, the buy the dip, which really has played out this year. In fact, at Stonex, one of our biggest calls, and probably our best call after gold this year, um, was to go long at the peak of the tariff meltdown. And that's when the market is collapsing based on fear, um, and so we went long biotech and banks actually, and that call since April 7th, um, is up double digits. So right now, what I'm looking at is is I'm looking at playing the defensives because the equities market is back on track and moving higher. I am very much more bullish than I think a lot of people are with respect to, and have been since day one, I'm proud to say, with regard to the geopolitical um, risk to oil prices. I called I had a piece out yesterday that called the the oil price shock that wasn't. Um, the Strait of Hormuz was, in my view, not going to be shut down, um, and probably never will be. Um, and and we and it was the the Iranian reaction was a far cry from that level of escalation, that catastrophic Armageddon type of escalation that would take oil prices potentially to 150 plus, um, and would derail the US and global economies. So I'm generally more bullish. I do like, however, to protect position, and what I'm telling our clients right now is when you have a return to risk, when you have the VIX falling, that's when you want to buy put options on your on your on your tech positions. Tech could move higher. I think you want to look at put options, and I think you want to look at second derivatives to the tech trade, which was our top performing recommendation last year, utilities, and I think we want to look at real estate industrial complex as a second derivative as well. .Uh Travis, the word of the uh, the day for me so far is basket basket case. So what's making me feel like a basket case? I know I look all polished out here, but I'm feeling it internally. Is this moving in Nvidia? Nvidia has really rallied and I go back, it was just a couple of months ago and the earnings report wasn't good. We have a shareholder meeting today for Nvidia. May not say much. Are you a big believer in this Nvidia rally? .Um, yes and no. I think it's been very strong in the most recent past, uh, Nvidia's performance over the last three months has been very strong. But over the last year, it's actually been a median performer versus large cap peers. Um, but we do think it's very close and I think the um, the last piece of the puzzle for the confirmation of the next kind of big out performance run in Nvidia is that kind of 150 level in Nvidia, which was the prior highs that we saw late last year and early this year. So we're on Nvidia watch in terms of that confirmation of the new uptrend, which I think if it has a breakout above that 150, then that'll be kind of the last signal that that needs to be in place. Um, but Brian, I think we coined the term resilient basket case. I think that's a good one for the US given the given the big sell off and the big rally back. I mean, it's only been beta and volatility which really mattered this year, which side you are on and the risk on risk off trades. So I like resilient basket case. That's a good one. .Yeah, well, if you want to be a resilient basket case, I mean what where else you looking at in tech? If if video's not your your vibe, we have these Micron earnings coming out, where else are you looking? .Yeah, we think, um, actually that the AI kind of tech industrial complex has broadened out, um, in this recent rally. So yeah, I mean, it's not that we don't like Nvidia, uh, it's actually very close to us really liking it. Uh, but right at the moment, we think there's some stronger momentum in like Broadcom, IBM, Oracle, and even if you broaden out into the small cap markets in the US, you know, infrastructure companies like Sterling infrastructure, um, you know, benefiting from the data center build out that seems to be uh, just insatiable demand. So I think there's a lot more uh, to play in US markets and globally than just Nvidia. So it's not that we don't like Nvidia, we like it. We just like uh, uh, a couple companies better than that right now. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-nears-record-highs-play-151145464.html,Market Risk

The firm estimates that spending on non-central-processing-unit compute, largely GPUs, could climb to about $2 trillion in 2028, or roughly 50% to 60% of total installed compute capacity, compared with about 15% today..“The math just works,” Donovan wrote, adding that the projected investment could support a $6 trillion market value for Nvidia if the company meets the brokerage’s earnings forecast..Nvidia shares were up about 1.2% at $149.30 in premarket trading..Loop Capital said the ramp-up of Nvidia’s new Blackwell-generation chips, coupled with widening adoption of AI “factory” data centres by governments, start-ups and mid-size cloud providers, positions the chipmaker for another leg of demand after rapid growth in 2023 and 2024..The firm now expects Nvidia to ship 6.5 million GPUs in calendar 2025 and 7.5 million in 2026 at average selling prices above $40,000 each. It also sees an expanding market for AI inference, the running of machine-learning models – as reasoning-oriented software agents move into production..Donovan cautioned that the new target assumes Nvidia continues to trade around 30 times forward earnings, in line with other large U.S. technology companies. A lower multiple would imply that “price-earnings compression” could offset some of the forecast growth, he said..Related articles.Loop Capital lifts Nvidia target to street high of $250 on AI chip spending.BMO cuts Triple Flag rating after 60% rally but lifts target.Powell: Fed’s interest rate control toolkit depends on bank reserves",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loop-capital-lifts-nvidia-target-132327739.html,no risk

Let's get to the three things that you need to know today. First up, US stock futures little changed today as the S&P 500 trades just within points of its all-time high. Meanwhile, tech stocks are leading the charge as the Nasdaq 100 closes out at a fresh record. But the higher stocks go, the louder the concern that multiples are starting to look frothy becomes. The S&P 500 is currently trading at 22 times expected profits in the next 12 months. That's 35% above its long-term average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Plus, traders are awaiting a second day of testimony from Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. The head of the Fed traded softly when he appeared before Congress on Tuesday, indicating the central bank is monitoring data before making any adjustments to its policy. Investors will be closely watching for any signs on the central bank's rate path ahead of its July meeting. And Nvidia's annual general meeting kicking off today. Shareholders will vote to re-elect the company's board at the event and will be watching an advisory vote on executive compensation. But no major fireworks are expected there. The meeting comes at a time when some on Wall Street are calling for the company to reach a $6 trillion valuation. That is the anticipation knocking around this morning. And analysts at Loop Capital note that Nvidia is at the front end of the next golden wave of Gen AI adoption and expect a material leg of stronger than anticipated demand.

After Chinese Electronics Corp., a Chinese state-owned company, acquired Pactera in 2020, it carved out the U.S. business, which eventually became an independent company..Rangapuram told Fortune that he was intrigued by the “disruptive and exciting possibilities” of physical AI, particularly in ASEAN and Singapore. (“Physical AI” refers to models designed to work with real-world machinery, like manufacturing equipment.) “The future is not just in North America, it’s global,” he said..The wish to expand to new markets was why Centific turned to Granite Asia and famed venture capitalist (and MPW Asia listee) Jenny Lee, one of the fund’s senior managing partners. Rangapuram pointed to Granite’s “network and resources within Asia and India” as part of the reason why he turned to Lee and her fund “as we diversify from the North American market into alternate markets around the globe.”.Granite Asia, in turn, sees the Centific investment as part of its mission to build “enduring infrastructure for the future of industry,” Lee said in a statement accompanying the funding announcement.

Forecasts estimate the AI market will expand from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. Two standout stocks in the sector are Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)..Palantir shares have rocketed more than 400% over the past 12 months through the week ending June 20. Nvidia is seeing its stock surging back from a 52-week low of $86.62 in April to near its January peak of $153.13..Both companies offer reasons to invest in their stocks, but if you had to choose one, which would be the better AI investment for the long run? Here's a look at Palantir and Nvidia to arrive at an answer..Palantir is a compelling investment choice because of the massive success of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Since AIP's launch in 2023, the company's business has been booming..For instance, in the first quarter, revenue rose 39% year over year to $883.9 million. Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue and legal officer, stated, ""Unrelenting demand for AIP continues to drive outperformance despite Q1 historically being our slowest quarter due to business seasonality."".Its strong start to 2025 contributed to the company raising its full-year sales guidance from $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion. This represents a substantial increase from 2024's $2.9 billion in revenue..Not only is AIP successful, the company is expanding its revenue opportunities by offering new AI products. One is Warp Speed, which uses AI to boost U.S. manufacturing efficiencies, such as handling resource planning and anticipating supply chain changes..About Warp Speed, CTO Shyam Sankar noted, ""Both the adoption and the rate of product development has exceeded expectations."".Palantir's sales growth has translated into strong financials. Its Q1 net income reached $217.7 million, more than double 2024's $106.1 million. The company's free cash flow (FCF) of $370.4 million is an impressive 42% year-over-year increase..The rationale for Nvidia's attractiveness as an AI investment begins with its leadership in semiconductor chips for AI. Its market share in this area is estimated to exceed 70%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-artificial-intelligence-stock-palantir-113500517.html,no risk

While cars represent Tesla's primary product today, the company has a vision to become an artificial intelligence (AI) empire..The most direct way that Tesla is deploying AI is through the introduction of autonomous vehicles. Tesla is seeking to create a fleet of self-driving cars, known as the robotaxi, that can be hailed by consumers -- similar to applications such as Uber or Lyft. While this is an exciting initiative, Tesla has another AI project that receives little attention: humanoid robotics..Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that humanoid robotics could be a ""multitrillion-dollar industry."" Furthermore, Huang specifically referenced the Tesla Optimus as one of the leading robotics businesses that excites him..Let's explore the different ways that Optimus might help Tesla. In addition, I'll analyze recent price action in Tesla stock to assess if now is a good time to buy the stock..On the surface, the idea of humanoid robots might sound like something out of a science fiction novel. However, what investors may not realize is that Tesla is far from the only company exploring the intersection of robotics and AI..When it comes to humanoid bots specifically, one of the more prominent start-ups is Figure AI -- which attracted a number of high-profile investors, including Nvidia..The video above demonstrates an example of how Figure AI plans to deploy its robots in labor-intensive environments , such as factories. The idea here is that complementing human workers alongside robotics can yield a new level of productivity, automation, and efficiency in the workforce.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-thinks-104500210.html,Strategic Risk

Others will benefit from unexpected catalysts, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that you couldn't have predicted when you first invested in them..That's why investing in multiple growth stocks can be a great idea because all you need is one big winner, one huge return to make it worth your while. Three stocks that are excellent examples of how just a single investment can yield life-changing returns are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG). By investing just $5,000 into any of these stocks 20 years ago and hanging on until today, you would be up more than $1 million..One of the biggest growth stories in recent years has been that of chipmaker Nvidia. It has made many millionaires as its business has taken off due to AI. Its chips are no longer used for just gaming, but are now critical in the development of AI technologies, including chatbots..While Nvidia has been a solid growth stock for years, things have gone to a whole other level since ChatGPT came on the scene in late 2022. That led to a flurry of tech spending and AI-related investments. In the trailing 12 months, Nvidia has generated a whopping $77 billion in profit. Just a few years ago it wasn't even bringing in that much in revenue..As a leading AI chipmaker, Nvidia still possesses a lot of long-term potential, which is why as long as you're looking for a stock to buy and hold, you're likely better off buying now than hoping for a big dip in price. If you'd invested $5,000 into this stock 20 years ago, you'd be sitting on an investment worth more than $3.1 million today..The trajectory for Netflix has been more consistent over the years, with the company revolutionizing its business model over time under great management. It went from mailing out DVDs to customers to offering streaming to now getting into live TV, sports, and even gaming. It has even been making its own content, as a way to expand its library and be less dependent on studios for licensing deals..The company is now a $40 billion business, and a highly profitable one, with net margins of more than 23%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Micron Technology, Inc. MU, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL..Micron Technology, Inc. will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. With its strong performance in the S&P 500 this month, a notable increase in both revenues and profits in the upcoming report could boost its stock price. So, should investors buy Micron stock pre-earnings or await clarity on margins? Let’s explore –.Micron is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 in the fiscal third quarter, a substantial increase from $0.62 in the same quarter last year, representing a year-over-year jump of 156.5%. Strong demand for Micron’s products in high-value segments, coupled with improved pricing conditions, is expected to drive the company’s earnings..Revenues are estimated to reach $8.84 billion in the fiscal third quarter, up 29.7% from last year’s sales of $6.81 billion. It’s also more than the fiscal second quarter’s sales of $8.05 billion. Sequentially rising sales indicate increased demand in memory markets, especially those driven by artificial intelligence (AI)..Additionally, Micron’s 10.7% average positive earnings surprise over the past four quarters indicates a strong likelihood of meeting its fiscal third-quarter results and boosting its stock price. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.).With the rise of AI, the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has grown because they can handle multiple tasks more efficiently. Now, GPUs require data storage memory, with Micron’s HBM3E leading the industry..NVIDIA Corp., therefore, has selected Micron’s HBM for its upcoming GB200 and GB300 Blackwell systems. Additionally, other chipmakers like Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology, Inc. are working on integrating HBM into their platforms, suggesting potential growth for Micron..Micron expects the data center HBM market to grow to $35 billion this year, reaching $100 billion by 2030. The company confirmed that it has sold out its entire HBM capacity for this year and is negotiating new contracts for next year.

But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems.

To that point, CoreWeave stock is trading over $170 a share, having an asking price that tops Nvidia shares at around $146..This certainly begs the question of whether the hype for CoreWeave stock is overdone or if the company is potentially a better AI investment than chip giant Nvidia..Reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape, CoreWeave has become Nvidia’s top GPU cloud partner, ahead of traditional hyperscalers like Microsoft and Alphabet. Having expertise in cutting-edge cloud services optimized for AI workloads, CoreWeave gained early access to Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs, including the much-coveted Blackwell chips..Furthermore, CoreWeave has helped Nvidia’s much sought-after AI chips build massive AI clusters that broke MLPerf training records, a widely recognized benchmarking suite designed to measure the performance of machine learning hardware, software, and services. It’s noteworthy that MLPerf Inference evaluates how quickly and efficiently systems can make predictions using trained models in real-world scenarios like object detection, medical imaging, and generative AI usage..Thanks to its successful partnership with Nvidia, CoreWeave has attracted major clients including OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Notably, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Being CoreWeave’s major GPU supplier and an early investor, it’s safe to say that Nvidia has earned significant revenue from the partnership and the appreciation of its equity stake of over 24 million CRWV shares..Pinpointing the market’s high sentiment for CoreWeave and alluding to lucrative earnings potential is the company’s rapid top-line expansion. CoreWeave’s total sales are expected to skyrocket 164% this year to $5.02 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2024. Zacks' projections call for CoreWeave’s sales to soar another 127% next year to $11.41 billion..Attributed to the AI boom, this type of growth has warranted investors to pull CoreWeave into Nvidia’s stratosphere, as Nvidia’s top line has expanded over 680% in the last five years from sales of $16.67 billion in its fiscal 2021 to $130.5 billion last year. Nvidia’s sales are currently projected to increase 51% in its current fiscal year 2026 and are projected to leap another 25% in FY27 to $247.24 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-070000205.html,Market Risk Valuation Risk

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor designer that competes with Intel and NVIDIA in the CPU and GPU markets. It is the smaller rival for both these firms, and a major success has been its ability to eat away Intel’s data center market share over the past couple of years due to the latter’s manufacturing woes. In the AI wave, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been a distant second to NVIDIA and has failed to capture a major portion of the market.

As for Cramer, he wondered whether the US was open to offering Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s GPUs to China as part of concessions during trade talks:.“I continue to think that when I look at Advanced Micro stock going up, that Advanced Micro has a GPU like NVIDIA. Not as powerful. Maybe that’s who they’re offering.”.Ahead of the analyst upgrade, Cramer discussed Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Cramer discussed US chip sanctions and what NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is likely thinking:.“[On Huang wanting China to have access to NVIDIA chips] Yeah he does, because he doesn’t have, he just wants to give them the Biden. The Biden chip. The H20.”.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a regular feature of Cramer’s morning show.

First, let’s take scale because scale is often what dictates what’s going to win in a brokerage area. At the end of the first quarter… eToro had just 3.58 million funded accounts with 14.8 billion in assets under administration… Webull and eToro are roughly the same size… Now, what about the financials?

She was responding to a question about Taiwan’ recent curbs on Chinese companies, and didn’t elaborate on how Beijing would respond..Taiwan last week joined a yearslong US campaign to curtail China’s technological ascent by adding the country’s AI and chipmaking champions — Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. — to its entity list. That bars the island’s firms from doing business with the pair without a license, the first time Taipei has used the blacklist on major Chinese companies..The new restrictions are likely to, at least partially, cut off Huawei and SMIC’s (0981.HK) access to Taiwan’s plant construction technologies, materials and equipment essential to build AI chips, like those made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) for the likes of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)..Zhu condemned Taiwan’s decision as “despicable” and claimed it displayed President Lai Ching-te’s loyalty to the US government. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, Bloomberg News previously reported..“Attempts to decouple will not delay the progress of industrial upgrading on the mainland,” Zhu said, adding that such actions will only damage the competitiveness of Taiwanese enterprises and the island’s economy..Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek.Inside Gap’s Last-Ditch, Tariff-Addled Turnaround Push.Luxury Counterfeiters Keep Outsmarting the Makers of $10,000 Handbags.Ken Griffin on Trump, Harvard and Why Novice Investors Won’t Beat the Pros.Is Mark Cuban the Loudmouth Billionaire that Democrats Need for 2028?.Can ‘MAMUWT’ Be to Musk What ‘TACO’ Is to Trump?.©2025 Bloomberg L.P..By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's

A lot has changed for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the last five years -- and for its investors.  First, let's recap what's happened over the last five years for Nvidia.","Nvidia's stock has surged over the last five years thanks to its leading position in the GPU market..As the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution picks up steam, the competition in the GPU market will undoubtedly increase..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.A lot has changed for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the last five years -- and for its investors. Shares have skyrocketed by more than 1,400% since then, handily outpacing the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which has only grown by 93% over that same period..So, what do the next five years hold in store for Nvidia? Should investors expect another big rally for the stock, or are shares destined to fall back to Earth?.Here's what I think..First, let's recap what's happened over the last five years for Nvidia. In 2020, Nvidia was already a large company, with a market cap of $225 billion and annual revenue of $13 billion. However, today, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.4 trillion, and its annual revenue is almost $150 billion..Behind this incredible rally is the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Nvidia designs the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computing power required to train and run large language models (LLMs). .Nvidia's GPUs, like the H100, H200, and Blackwell, have formed the backbone of an AI chip empire that has pushed the company all the way to the top of the list of largest American companies (by market cap)..One of the most challenging parts of analyzing Nvidia's 2030 prospects is that its chief market -- the GPU data center industry -- is a cutting-edge field, and it's unclear how much it will grow over the next five years..Because of that, analyst estimates for Nvidia's 2030 revenue vary wildly. Estimates range from the low end of $281 billion to $600 billion at the top end..Beyond the question of how much Nvidia can generate in revenue is how much of those sales the company can convert to profits. .At the moment, Nvidia has far and away the best margins in its industry. Indeed, its margins stand head and shoulders above some of its longtime competitors like AMD and Intel..However, those companies are ramping up their efforts to compete with Nvidia in the lucrative AI GPU market. AMD has its own series of AI GPUs on the market that offer AI developers an alternative to Nvidia. Similarly, Intel is making efforts to grow its share of the AI GPU market. Finally, most of the big tech companies, like Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, have also started work on developing their own AI chips.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-nvidia-5-years-011500823.html,no risk

You're likely not alone. A year of tariff tussles capped off with bombs flying in the Middle East probably had most worried about their stock market portfolios..Yet, despite the chaos, the S&P 500 has continued an epic run since it got oversold in early April following President Trump announcing tougher-than-thought tariffs on global trade partners..Related: Wall Street veteran analyst who predicted stock market rally resets forecast.The SPDR S&P 500 ETF  (SPY)  has now marched more than 22.6% higher since President Trump paused implementing most reciprocal tariffs on April 9 for 90 days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has performed even better, rallying 30.4%..The S&P 500 is now only 1.1% below an all-time high. The Invesco Nasdaq 100 Trust  (QQQ) , which comprises the biggest stocks in the Nasdaq, including Nvidia, is within 0.20% of an all-time high..I bet you didn't have that on your bingo card. Especially, last week, when worry mounted that the stock market's run would falter under the weight of rising geopolitical worry after Israel attacked Iran, prompting daily missile fires between the two countries..The potential for the conflict to spread sent oil prices surging, and concerns seemed well-founded when the U.S. announced on June 22 it had dropped bunker busters on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility..Related: Analyst sends blunt 8-word message ahead of trade deal deadline.Yet, the stock market largely looked beyond the concerns as big money investors made bets that the war would be measured in days not years..The S&P 500 retreated just 0.46% last week, while the Nasdaq 100 was essentially flat. On Monday, when markets opened after the U.S. bombing, stocks found their footing, surging on hopes for a ceasefire..The gains continued on June 24, as investors increasingly became comfortable with tensions de-escalating..The S&P 500 gained 1.1% on June 24 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4% on the session..Initially, it appeared that tempers would overcome peace, given Iran and Israel both launched additional missiles after President Trump's ceasefire announcement..Those actions sparked a sharp rebuke from President Trump, who laid into both countries before boarding Marine One on the White House lawn..""I'm not happy with Israel...I'm not happy with Iran...

In the video above, Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace shares what he will be watching for from the event..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here..I usually usually shareholder meeting, kind of humdrum, right? .Doesn't have a lot of fireworks. You got executive comp that gets rubber stamped. We elect the board. Maybe a shareholder proposes something the board hates and it goes down in flames. But tomorrow, you say actually .What we can I think we could see something, right? Because typically, companies tend to give an overview of how business is going, right? They might comment on some recent developments. And this is Jensen Wang after all. And he does spin a pretty good yarn. Josh, to the extent that he says anything incrementally positive, whether it's reaffirming expectations that Wall Street has, talks about inference, which was a comment we talked about earlier about AMD and the huge push that that's going to have, maybe he says something about how Blackwell is doing, or what I'd like to hear is, hey, margins in the back half of the year, they are going to ramp as we mature in our Blackwell production. It could be anything. Could be nothing. But we have to pay attention. .You own Nvidia in this portfolio. .The Street Pro portfolio? Absolutely. .After the run it's enjoyed, Chris, are you just kind of sitting tight here? Are you adding? You booking a little profit? .Well, so typically, we have a very hard rule with the Pro portfolio. If a position eclipses four and a half percent, we will start to trim it back. Now, the Nvidia position, even though it's been very strong, and we own a decent size in the portfolio, it hasn't hit that point yet. So we are watching it. So some of the data points that I'm watching that could potentially tip us into that area. Well, as we move into from June to July, we could get some Taiwan Semiconductor monthly revenue numbers, their quarterly results, same for Foxconn, those are nice leading indicators. We'll also going to be watching big tech and what they have to say about capital spending levels for the second half of the year. Do they say anything early? Maybe not formal numbers, but tip their hand a little bit for what capital spending could be in 2026. If we see that happening and it's positive, that really could lift Nvidia further. .What about the yellow flag I will hear some folks throw, which is what if Nvidia can't sell? What if Jensen can't sell his latest and greatest AI chips to Beijing? Then what? .I think a lot of that's been kind of baked in. That's not a new conversation. I would actually flip it around and say what about what we're seeing for AI and data center growth outside the US? You know, and I joked earlier, we were off camera, you know, they're building data centers in Armenia. You know, you can see whether it's, you know, the European version of Stargate, or other countries, there is ramping data center demand. And I think that with Blackwell being sold out, you know, there is room for some upside as these other projects are announced.

185,2025-06-25 03:16:00,Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Soaring Today,"Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 6.5% in the afternoon session after Melius Research analysts upgraded the stock, citing improving prospects for the company's artificial intelligence chips.","Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 6.5% in the afternoon session after Melius Research analysts upgraded the stock, citing improving prospects for the company's artificial intelligence chips..Melius upgraded the stock from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and significantly raised its price target from $110 to $175 per share. The analyst noted that ""many things have changed for the better since the beginning of the year,"" highlighting AMD's potential to gain ground on rival Nvidia, particularly in the AI inference market..The firm believes investors will become more excited about AMD's GPU sales outlook from 2026 to 2028 and sees its upcoming MI400 processor, set to launch next year, as a potential big winner. The upgrade added to positive momentum for semiconductor stocks, boosting the overall sector..The shares closed the day at $138.48, up 6.9% from previous close..Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free..AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business..The previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 9.4% on the news that Piper Sandler analysts maintained a Buy rating and raised the price target from $125 to $140..Following talks with management, the analysts became more bullish on AMD's AI business and expect the segment to grow even faster when the tariff headwinds in China have passed. They also highlighted the growing conviction on Wall Street regarding one of AMD's hyperscaler clients..Separately, stocks rebounded as reports pointed to easing tensions between Israel and Iran. The Wall Street Journal said senior Iranian officials had signaled a willingness to restart stalled nuclear talks, on the condition that Washington refrain from joining Israel's ongoing strikes. This development triggered a significant decline in oil prices, easing inflation concerns. Also, it is possible some investors were buying the dip following the sell-off at the end of the previous week..AMD is up 14.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $138.33 per share, it is still trading 24.8% below its 52-week high of $183.96 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,640..Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SNDK. Sandisk Corporation (SNDK)'s share was trading at $42.5 as of 13th June..A data centre room with cloud technology, illustrating the enterprise application software services..Sandisk, now operating independently following its separation from Western Digital, is quietly carving out a powerful niche in the AI infrastructure arms race. Its Gen5 enterprise SSDs were recently certified by NVIDIA for datacenter use, officially embedding the company into the AI server vendor chain. The standout innovation is Sandisk’s proprietary High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) architecture—developed fully in-house—designed for massive capacity and throughput, tailored specifically for AI workloads..This positions Sandisk as a one-of-a-kind supplier with differentiated technology. Complementing this, the company is shipping BiCS8, one of the most power-efficient flash technologies currently available. Cloud hyperscaler traction is rising rapidly: 12% of total output went to AWS, GCP, and Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago, reflecting intensifying AI-related spend. This growth appears sustainable, as internal reports from major tech companies show transformative AI deployment efforts already yielding dramatic productivity gains..While the company still has a consumer-facing segment, its real upside lies in enterprise AI, where it's now gaining relevance in billion-dollar deal cycles. Financially, Sandisk posted $1.7B in revenue and $220M in adjusted free cash flow this quarter, with $1.5B in cash on hand..Despite soft gross margins (22.7%) due to pricing and NAND volatility, management is focused on restoring profitability. The company is also making moves in gaming, EVs, and content creation, expanding its flash technology footprint. Risks remain, including thin options liquidity and lingering consumer weakness, but with unique AI-aligned assets and accelerating cloud demand, Sandisk offers asymmetric upside..For now, it's a high-risk bet with potentially transformative payoff..Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Intel (INTC) by Jellym9s on wallstreetbets in December 2024, framing it as a turnaround bet anchored by its Foundry Services and geopolitical tailwinds favoring domestic chip production. The thesis outlined a potential strategic pivot away from lagging product segments toward becoming the U.S. equivalent of TSMC. The thesis on Sandisk (SNDK) by b0men extends this theme of U.S.-based semiconductor resurgence, but through the lens of AI infrastructure. Sandisk’s proprietary enterprise SSD technology and early traction with hyperscalers signal a niche, high-performance role in AI datacenters, offering complementary upside to Intel’s foundry ambitions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sandisk-corporation-sndk-bull-case-191158565.html,Market risk
187,2025-06-25 04:00:00,"Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell Micron Stock Before Fiscal Q3 Earnings?","MU eyes strong Q3 with EPS up 156% and AI-driven demand for HBM chips, but margin pressure may cloud the rally.","Micron Technology, Inc. MU will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. With its strong performance in the S&P 500 this month, a notable increase in both revenues and profits in the upcoming report could boost its stock price. So, should investors buy Micron stock pre-earnings or await clarity on margins? Let’s explore –.Micron is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 in the fiscal third quarter, a substantial increase from $0.62 in the same quarter last year, representing a year-over-year jump of 156.5%. Strong demand for Micron’s products in high-value segments, coupled with improved pricing conditions, is expected to drive the company’s earnings..Revenues are estimated to reach $8.84 billion in the fiscal third quarter, up 29.7% from last year’s sales of $6.81 billion. It’s also more than the fiscal second quarter’s sales of $8.05 billion. Sequentially rising sales indicate increased demand in memory markets, especially those driven by artificial intelligence (AI)..Additionally, Micron’s 10.7% average positive earnings surprise over the past four quarters indicates a strong likelihood of meeting its fiscal third-quarter results and boosting its stock price. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.).Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.With the rise of AI, the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has grown because they can handle multiple tasks more efficiently. Now, GPUs require data storage memory, with Micron’s HBM3E leading the industry..NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, therefore, has selected Micron’s HBM for its upcoming GB200 and GB300 Blackwell systems. Additionally, other chipmakers like Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL are working on integrating HBM into their platforms, suggesting potential growth for Micron..Micron expects the data center HBM market to grow to $35 billion this year, reaching $100 billion by 2030. The company confirmed that it has sold out its entire HBM capacity for this year and is negotiating new contracts for next year. The high demand for HBM has allowed Micron to increase its pricing by 11% in 2025..The rise in HBM demand and prices positions Micron for strong earnings both in the upcoming report and in the future. Micron also stands to benefit from the growing demand for DRAM in AI smartphones and PCs..Strong earnings expectations from high demand for HBM products will boost Micron’s stock price. The projected rise in NVIDIA’s AI chip sales due to Micron’s HBM3E in their GPUs will further benefit its business and stock value. Micron also plans to increase market share against Samsung, as the latter faces challenges passing NVIDIA’s qualification test with HBM3E memory chips, compared to Micron’s improving HBM-chip yields.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-hold-sell-micron-stock-190000282.html,Profitability Risk
