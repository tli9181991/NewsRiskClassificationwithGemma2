2025-06-25 21:57:00,Top Sin Stocks for Savvy Investors: Profiting From the Unconventional,"Sin stocks offer defensive growth, with steady demand across alcohol, tobacco and gambling sectors, wherein reputation takes a back seat.","An updated edition of the May 19, 2025, article.The stock market is often seen through the lens of morality these days, with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing growing rapidly. However, there is another side to the market that continues to quietly draw interest from investors focused on returns over reputation — the sin stock market.Sin stocks represent companies operating in industries deemed socially or ethically controversial, yet they often deliver steady profits. These typically include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and gambling. These businesses cater to human immoralities and are frequently heavily regulated, but they also generate steady revenue streams due to consistent demand. While shunned by many institutional funds, sin stocks have carved out a loyal base of contrarian investors drawn to their resilience and income potential.What sets these stocks apart is their behavior relative to the broader market. Despite ethical concerns, these stocks are defensive, offering growth even in economic downturns. People tend to continue smoking, drinking or gambling even when the economy slows. These companies typically enjoy strong pricing power and resilient profit margins. Additionally, sin stocks are known for generating stable cash flows, driven by their steady income. As a result, many of these businesses reward shareholders generously through regular and often above-average dividend payouts, making them attractive to dividend-focused investors.However, investing in sin stocks comes with ethical considerations. Industries like tobacco and gambling are linked to adverse health and social consequences, which may clash with the values of individual or institutional investors. Additionally, these sectors are subject to stringent regulations, legal scrutiny and shifting political sentiment, all of which can impact profitability and long-term stock performance. Negative public perception can also weigh on investor sentiment and limit institutional ownership.Ultimately, investors must carefully assess whether sin stocks align with their financial objectives and personal values.For instance, Philip Morris International PM dominates the tobacco industry, with strong pricing power, accelerating smoke-free growth and consistent earnings momentum. PM has proved that it is more than just a legacy tobacco company; it is a forward-thinking leader in the global shift toward reduced-risk products.Similarly, as sports betting legalization accelerates and online gaming expands, Caesars Entertainment CZR has positioned itself as a leader in the gambling sector. CZR's efforts to integrate its digital and physical offerings through a cohesive omnichannel strategy support its goal of driving seamless cross-platform engagement and enhancing customer loyalty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-sin-stocks-savvy-investors-135700872.html

2025-06-12 01:04:00,Investing in Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) three years ago would have delivered you a 37% gain,"Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are...","Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) share price is up 32% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 3.7% in the last year..With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)..Las Vegas Sands became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up..You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image)..It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Las Vegas Sands' earnings, revenue and cash flow..When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Las Vegas Sands the TSR over the last 3 years was 37%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return..Investors in Las Vegas Sands had a tough year, with a total loss of 1.6% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 14%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 2% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Las Vegas Sands better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Las Vegas Sands is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-las-vegas-sands-nyse-170450587.html

Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 10% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves.

""Ultimately, a thriving hospitality sector supports jobs in a range of fields and at all levels, contributing to economic strength and vitality in our regions."".Hospitality Scholarship Programs.Scholarships for hospitality students are an important part of Sands' efforts, and last year, the company launched a new partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), the only national association representing Hispanic-serving Institutions, to spur the success of hospitality students at HSIs..Sands and HACU awarded 13 students at HACU-member schools with Sands Hospitality Advancement Scholarships in the amounts of $5,000 or $2,500 to support their preparation for careers in the travel, tourism and leisure industry.

(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 60 cents, indicating a decline of 20% from 75 cents reported in the year-ago quarter..For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $2.93 billion. The metric suggests a deterioration of 0.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure..Las Vegas Sands Corp. price-eps-surprise | Las Vegas Sands Corp. Quote.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter..LVS’ first-quarter 2025 performance is likely to have benefited from a strong recovery in Macau, strategic investments in Singapore and capital return initiatives. Attributes like high-value tourism growth and a robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.LVS is expected to have witnessed revenue growth across its segments in the quarter under discussion. Our model predicts Londoner Macao, Parisian Macao and Sands Macao net revenues to improve 9.7%, 11.4% and 19.4% from the year-ago levels to $616.4 million, $256.2 million and $90.8 million, respectively.Our model suggests revenues from casinos, food and beverage and malls to rise 1.7%, 4.1% and 1% from the prior-year levels to $2.26 billion, $156.2 million and $175.7 million, respectively.However, softness in retail sales in Macao, particularly at the Four Seasons Mall, could have negatively impacted non-gaming revenues in the first quarter. A pullback in luxury spending following the post-COVID boom and macroeconomic uncertainty in China might have weighed on turnover rents. Additionally, labor and operational cost pressures could have impacted margins during the first quarter..Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Las Vegas Sands this time.

He joined the company as a cybersecurity analyst at the culmination of his fellowship in January..It's no coincidence that Sands' first HOH hire was in cybersecurity. The company was introduced to the program by Doug Medley, director of Cybersecurity, who also participated in HOH..""HOH was one of many Department of Defense SkillBridge opportunities presented to me during my Transition Assistance Program briefings,"" Medley said. ""As an HOH alum, I felt it was important to add a pathway for separating service members to work in positions not associated with the government. Since I saw first-hand the win-win situation the program offers, it only made sense to bring it to Sands."".The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's HOH program is offered to military service members, veterans, and military spouses.

Candidates are carefully matched with participating companies based on their specific skills and company needs. Once fellows are assigned to a host company, they undergo exclusive on-the-job training and are able to gain work experience in the private sector. This real-world training is augmented by weekly educational sessions held for the HOH cohort working in various company assignments..""The host company gets access to a large group of professionals with a wide variety of skillsets and experience levels to grow and sustain their team,"" Medley said. ""They also get to know a candidate and determine suitability for a role without all the costs associated with hiring a team member or paid intern. Service members get to learn about a company while still receiving their military pay and benefits. This allows them more flexibility and opportunities to find a job that is the right fit for them.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sands-hires-first-corporate-team-142500823.html

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) stands against other best gambling stocks to buy according to analysts..Gambling stocks include companies that own, run, or manage lawful gambling activities and events such as horse and dog racing, online gaming, bingo, and video lottery, as well as companies that provide products or services to gaming operators..During the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation and stay-at-home orders spurred a boom in online sports betting and gambling. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak ended, sales continued to rise. As per Vixio Regulatory Intelligence, the US online gambling industry is estimated to generate $26.8 billion in gross revenue in 2025, up from $23.4 billion in 2024, with projections pointing to more than $41 billion by 2028. While iGaming is still restricted to a few strongholds, mobile sports betting is still on the rise, with one state recently surpassing $2 billion in yearly revenue. Under normal conditions, New Jersey’s online gambling revenue surpassed that of land-based casinos in October 2024, whereas states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan have iGaming earnings that exceed $200 million monthly..However, expansion encounters opposition. Legalization efforts in New York, Maryland, and Louisiana continue, but union opposition and legislative friction persist. If just one of these states legalizes iGaming, it could start a domino effect. Another obstacle is tax increases; in 2024, several jurisdictions raised their sports betting tax rates, raising concerns that such high rates could impede innovation and competitiveness. Payment processing also remains a significant concern. Major financial services networks continue to restrict gambling transactions, intensifying the need for digital wallets and other workarounds, which authorities examine with caution. Meanwhile, sweepstakes platforms are growing in unregulated marketplaces, raising concerns as policymakers consider stronger regulations..According to CasinoReports.com estimates, the US-regulated online sports betting market is anticipated to reach $150 billion by 2024, driven by 32 states that allow online gambling. The CEO and co-founder of Third Planet Affiliates, Adam Small, who owns and operates the iGaming news media company CasinoReports.com and the sports betting website Props.com, stated that the two large platforms dominate the business, accounting for around 75% of total wagers and revenue. Small believes there is still room for digital gambling to expand in the coming years, as Texas, California, and a more open Florida will deliver “a large jolt” to the digital sports gambling market.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) stands against other best economic recovery stocks to buy..Economic cycles, as defined by economists, alternate between periods of growth, peak, recession, and recovery, depending on the stage that a country’s economy is at. In particular, the term “economic recovery” describes the period that follows a recession and is characterized by improving employment, increased business activity and investment, rising consumer confidence, and accelerating GDP growth. Recoveries usually start after governments enact fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate investment and spending – the primary stimulative instrument in the US has been the FED funds rate. When an economic recovery kicks in, the sectors that tend to outperform are the cyclical ones – consumer discretionary, industrial, financial, and technology – driven by both a recovery in the previously depressed valuations as well as by broad acceleration in growth..Another important consideration for investors is that the stock market and the economy do not move in sync; the former tends to be a forward-looking animal, meaning that stock prices tend to rise in anticipation of an economic recovery, while the actual economic conditions may still be depressed and reflect low GDP growth, high unemployment and sluggish private spending. Consequently, the key takeaway for readers is that investments in economic recovery stocks shall be made during peak uncertainty and pain, at or near a market bottom when everyone is fearful and reluctant to buy. As the legendary Warren Buffet has put it,.“Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”.READ ALSO: 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy According to Analysts..The US economy and stock market are the most developed in the world and often reflect textbook examples of economic cycles. The previous unofficial recession in the US occurred in 2022, when the GDP growth posted 2 quarters of negative growth amid a sharp increase in interest rates to combat rising inflation. The stock market moved in sync with the economy during that year. The following year, 2023, resembled a slow recovery fueled by the emergence of the AI megatrend as well as strong public spending on infrastructure and other large projects. Calendar 2024 and early 2025 resembled an economic peak, as growth moderated and private spending became weaker. In such moments, even the slightest economic headwind and/or uncertainty can trigger a recession and a broad market meltdown. That’s exactly what happened with the new Trump 2.0 administration, which brought plenty of uncertainty related to tariffs and sharp cuts in the public sector.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-corp-lvs-212712484.html

Programs span mentoring, educational support, health and wellness, economic empowerment and leadership development..Sands has supported 100 Black Men Las Vegas with annual contributions that underwrite mentorship and other youth programs through the Sands Cares community engagement program..""With Sands continued support over these past few years, we've been able to pursue even bigger goals in 2024 and reach more youth and families in our community,"" Gentry Richardson, president and chief executive officer of 100 Black Men Las Vegas, said. ""Through all of our initiatives, we are working toward a better future for our community members by surrounding them with resources and skillsets that prepare them for successful, self-sufficient futures."".One of the programs Sands funds is a free monthly Virtual Youth Cooking Class, which 100 Black Men Las Vegas launched in 2020 as a way to support families during the pandemic. A highlight in the 2024 cooking series was the November session led by award-winning chef, author and motivational speaker Jeff Henderson, founder of the Chef Jeff Project, which empowers future leaders through the spirit of hospitality. The Chef Jeff Project provides mentorship, culinary and leadership training, and networking for career opportunities..Held on Nov. 19, Chef Jeff's cooking class focused on how to prepare traditional Thanksgiving dishes including fried chicken, mashed potatoes and English peas.

2025-04-09 22:00:00,Analysts Estimate Las Vegas Sands (LVS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Las Vegas Sands (LVS) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,"Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price..The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise..This casino operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16%..Revenues are expected to be $2.95 billion, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.52% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-las-vegas-sands-140018713.html

Luísa de Bragança joined Sands China in 2017 as assistant general counsel and now serves as senior assistant general counsel..De Bragança began her career at a law firm in Portugal and today oversees Sands China's legal matters in several areas of Macao law, including gaming, banking and finance, company, real estate, intellectual property, tax, labor, tourism and licensing. She is an environmental and sustainability enthusiast and a member of the Sands ECO360 and ESG steering committees. Last year, she became chair of the ESG steering committee and a steering committee member for the EmpowHER Team Member resource group, which kicked off at Sands China in 2024..What early experiences helped you build a successful career?.""I started my career in Portugal as a trainee in a major law firm and had the opportunity to work in all of the firm's departments where I gained experience in most areas of law. As a trainee, I began with the basics and was tasked with preparing deeds and registrations and checking case files in court. I believe this is the best recipe for success in the legal field - starting with your sleeves rolled up, engaging in hands-on, foundational tasks and slowly progressing to roles that require more responsibility. It is essential to learn the basics at the beginning of your career, as this will help you better understand the bigger picture later on..""After completing a master's degree in commercial law with a focus on banking and finance, which became my main area of expertise, I joined a Macao law firm in 2001 and was tasked with a project that led me to where I am today - the first Macao gaming tender. I had the opportunity to represent one of the bidders. At this firm, I also had my first big victory in court. I was tasked to file an injunction and have it decided in just three days. When most said it would be impossible, I succeeded. This taught me a valuable lesson that I apply whenever needed, ‘The no is always guaranteed, but we can only get a yes if we try!'.""Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to be mentored by great lawyers, the first of which had a motto: ‘never complain, never explain.' He never explained what he meant and said I would one day understand. As a young lawyer, this sounded nonsensical and even counterintuitive, but as the years went by, it began to make sense. If you feel the need to complain, you should have acted earlier; and if you feel the need to explain, it is because you failed to act in a timely manner. A good lawyer who anticipates needs and does the job will not have to complain or explain.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/women-history-month-spotlight-sands-125500960.html

While these corporate dynamics unfolded, broader market turmoil from escalating global trade tensions exacerbated the decline. The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all experienced steep losses, with drops of 8%, 9%, and 10% respectively, as tariffs unsettled investor sentiment.

Notably, this return underperformed the US market and the hospitality industry over the past year. Several factors may have influenced this performance. First, the completion of The Londoner in 2025 is anticipated to improve competitive standing in Macao. However, operational challenges prior to full capacity utilization may have weighed on margins. Additionally, the consistent reliance on the Chinese economy introduces some risk, especially given fluctuating market conditions and the potential impact on revenue growth..The company continued its capital returns focus, with active buyback initiatives and dividend announcements. A US$449.96 million repurchase of shares between October and December 2024 highlights this commitment. Despite robust earnings growth, as seen in the fourth quarter of 2024, these measures did not offset market concerns fully. Moreover, executive changes, including appointments like Muktesh Micky Pant and internal shifts with Robert G.

Penny Lo joined Marina Bay Sands in 2010 as associate general counsel and now serves as vice president and deputy general counsel, data protection officer..Over the years, she has held different roles on the legal team including interim chief compliance officer and interim general counsel. Her current scope of work covers all non-gaming contracts and projects, business unit legal, HR issues, development contracts related to Marina Bay Sands' expansion and certain gaming regulatory matters. She also serves as data protection officer for the resort and works closely with the cybersecurity and IT teams in this area..What is your background at Marina Bay Sands?.""I had worked in Shanghai from 2004 to 2009 in an Asia Pacific attorney role and was traveling regionally for my job. When my second child was about to arrive, I felt it would be easier to raise my two children with the support of my extended family in Singapore. My then-boss Faris Alsagoff had joined Marina Bay Sands in 2010 and asked me if I was interested in an opening at the resort. It was a great opportunity to join an exciting new industry in Singapore and with less travel involved so I could be home more for my kids..""In the early years I worked mostly on gaming-related legal and compliance work. I would not have been able to survive if not for the generosity of much more experienced people in casino management who spent many hours explaining the inner workings of a casino to me..""After Faris left the company, I took on two portfolios - running the legal department and the surveillance department. It was the toughest part of my career because I was thrust into the deep end. On top of that, I decided to have my third child..""Eventually, Faris came back to Marina Bay Sands. Running the legal department with him for the last 14 years has been a fulfilling experience, especially when it's a department where people are happy and stay for many years."".What resources and experiences helped you build a successful career?.""I think ‘success at work' is a combination of a multitude of factors, not all of which are under one's control and some of which are really because people helped and gave me opportunities. So much of it is also by chance. For example, who would have thought I would have the opportunity to help build the legal department from scratch in 2010 to what it is today and to do it for a company like Marina Bay Sands? It only happened because I was there at the right time, and Faris and former managing director George Tanasijevich gave me an opportunity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/womens-history-month-spotlight-marina-133500535.html

""The challenge in the hospitality industry is balancing selection of goods and services that are better for the environment with guest expectations for a high-end travel experience. That's why system-wide collaboration among our teams is key."".Sourcing Responsible Goods and Services.On a regular basis, Sands evaluates sourcing in key areas such as food and beverage services, hotel operations, and business and marketing materials to introduce or increase sustainable products and services. The company has placed special emphasis on addressing sustainability at company-owned restaurants and in catering operations..Delivering outstanding food and beverage options is an essential component of creating a world-class guest experience, and Sands has focused on incorporating sustainable food into that experience. Efforts have included promoting sustainable sourcing to chefs and eliminating or reducing certain types of seafood from company-owned restaurants and food service operations. The company also targets sourcing of seafood products that are certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)..In addition, Sands has set a global target to source cage-free eggs for 100% of its operations by 2028. The company began this transition at select food and beverage outlets and in-suite dining in 2023 and will report on 2024 progress in its annual environmental, social and governance (ESG) report to be published this spring..Furthering the commitment of sourcing environmentally responsible products and services, Sands also strives to upcycle materials to avoid sending items to landfills. For example, Marina Bay Sands partnered with ChopValue, a company that turns chopsticks into stylish products, to repurpose one million of these used utensils into cube-shaped menu displays for Sands Expo® and Convention Centre events and banquets. Some of the chopsticks were sourced from the resort's Wakuda restaurant.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-sands-commitment-using-sustainable-160500411.html

I thought hospitality was a very unique offering, with endless creativity combined with structured project requirements..""My experience spans from doing the work, managing the work, leading the work and large teams, and pursuing the work to landing accounts such as Ritz Carlton and then becoming an associate. As an associate, I began to understand the business aspect of design; that was invaluable experience. I was in Washington, D.C., and exposed to large hospitality brands and large government projects. I had the opportunity to see all project types and all aspects of projects, and I know that's what makes my experience unique..""From there, I decided that I wanted to focus on luxury hospitality. I was fortunate to have support from people around me, who gave me ideas on how to define my brand based on my experience and my reputation. I received an offer from Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, an international luxury brand, and this was my segue into traveling the world. I learned how to do projects internationally - in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, the Caribbean and South America. Being exposed to diverse cultures, technology, the means and methods of the regions, as well as the legal and financial aspects of these projects was invaluable for my career..""In my career, I have always gone to where opportunity presents itself. Some people would say it's very ambitious or courageous to pick up and move, but I find it amazing. I've lived in Paris, Hong Kong and Toronto - those opportunities brought me many different perspectives..""In Paris, I worked on one of the last five historical palaces that was commissioned by King Louis XV. I had once-in-a-lifetime experience collaborating with Carl Lagerfeld, the fashion icon, for Chanel and Fendi couture. When I was at Rosewood, the company was bought by New World Development Company, a large Hong Kong conglomerate. I was asked to bridge the gap between Western and Asian culture and experience by determining how the brand could create a fusion of culture for the new brand launch. In Toronto, I was vice president of creative at Four Season Hotels and Resorts and was able to look at the brand holistically and see how design aesthetic came through in the guest experience throughout their collection of hotels, working very closely with their owners and developers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/women-history-month-spotlight-eileen-164000985.html

However, an uncertain macro environment is a concern.","Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS is poised to benefit from strong momentum in the Macau market, recovery in Singapore’s travel demand and robust capital return initiatives. Also, strategic investments in infrastructure development bode well. However, an uncertain macro environment and stiff competition are concerning.Let’s delve deeper..The Macao market continues to grow. During the fourth quarter of 2024, total gaming revenues in the market increased 6% year over year. Mass gaming revenues also saw a 5% year-over-year rise. Backed by long-term commitment investments, Las Vegas Sands aims to capitalize on the likely structural growth in Macao in the coming years to stay ahead of the curve in terms of the quality and scale of its products and amenities. The company remains focused on expanding non-gaming opportunities in Macao. The outlook for Macao remains positive, with gross gaming revenues expected to surpass $30 billion in 2025 and grow annually thereafter.Beyond Macao, Las Vegas Sands is benefiting from a strong tourism rebound in Singapore, supported by continued investments in Marina Bay Sands (""MBS""). In the fourth quarter, MBS posted net revenues of $1.14 billion, up from $1.06 billion a year ago, with strong gains across casino, hotel and retail segments. Mass gaming revenues rallied 28% year over year to $746 million, marking a 71% jump from pre-pandemic levels. With a $1.75 billion investment program nearing completion in mid-2025, LVS expects further growth as Singapore attracts more high-value tourists..LVS’ strategy revolves around investing in scalable, high-quality assets that deliver superior returns on capital. With a strong presence in gaming and non-gaming segments, the company is positioned to capture a growing share of high-value tourism and leisure spending. The ongoing investments in infrastructure ensure a solid foundation for sustained long-term growth.Las Vegas Sands is dedicated to rewarding its shareholders through significant capital returns. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company repurchased $450 million worth of its stock and increased its annual dividend to $1 per share for 2025. Additionally, it has strengthened its stake in Sands China, purchasing $250 million worth of shares and raising its equity interest to 72.3%.

(NYSE:LVS) stands against the other best casino stocks..The casino industry has rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, due to pent-up demand from gamblers and visitors returning to popular places such as Las Vegas. Brick-and-mortar casinos make a substantial profit from hotel operations, conventions, and other events in addition to the revenues that they make from slot machines and table games. Casino stocks are categorized as consumer discretionary since tourism and gambling spending are strongly correlated with the overall economic condition. According to Market Research Future, the global casino market is projected to grow from $309.54 billion in 2024 to $511.6 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.48% over the forecast period (2024-2032). Furthermore, in 2023, the casino market was estimated to be worth $290.7 billion..Regionally, the Asia Pacific Casino market dominates the industry due to the growing availability of online casinos and the average individual’s income. The North American casino market has the second-largest market share due to the legalization of sports betting and the approval of online gambling in the region. Furthermore, the UK casino market grew at the quickest rate in the European region, while the German casino industry held the largest market share..Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon recently highlighted the significant market reaction to casino industry earnings even though the results were essentially in line with forecasts. After five years of underperformance, the industry saw double-digit stock increases due to improving sentiment, potential interest rate drops, and solid early-year trends. Although Macau’s recovery is still below pre-pandemic levels, gaming revenue is projected to rise by 8% in 2025, outperforming the U.S. market’s flat-to-2% growth. Chinese New Year activity was consistent rather than volatile, showing a healthy demand trend. By bypassing the costs of licensing and regulations, new event-based contracts may pose a threat to established operators. However, Beynon believes that licensed operators will fight back, as they did against sweepstakes and illegal betting. Investor confidence was strengthened by generally favorable remarks regarding recent trends, even if some companies decided not to provide updates during the quarter. The industry is now seen more favorably by analysts after years of weak performance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-corp-lvs-131834141.html

(NYSE:LVS) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow..We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.. See our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years..Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:.2025.2026.2027.2028.2029.2030.2031.2032.2033.2034.

Goldstein set to step down as Chairman and CEO, transitioning to a Senior Advisor role by March 2026. This shift, alongside Patrick Dumont's anticipated promotion, may have influenced market sentiment, contributing to a 4% share price increase over the last week. This appreciation contrasts with broader market conditions as major indexes experienced declines due to economic concerns regarding tariffs and weaker-than-expected employment data. The Dow and S&P 500 were on track for their worst weeks in two years, reflecting uncertainty about economic health. Despite this backdrop, Las Vegas Sands's performance suggests investor confidence in its strategic leadership and future prospects. As the company navigates this transition, its focus on both operational continuity and adaptation to prevailing economic conditions remains critical..See the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Las Vegas Sands..Over the past three years, Las Vegas Sands achieved a total shareholder return of 21.27%. This return reflects various factors including robust earnings growth, with its earnings increasing by 18.1% annually over a five-year span—outpacing the broader hospitality industry's growth. Additionally, Las Vegas Sands engaged in a substantial share buyback program, repurchasing millions of shares, which likely bolstered shareholder value..Significant investments in new projects, such as the opening of the MSG Sphere with The Venetian, also contributed to the company's attractiveness. However, the last year saw the company's shares underperform the broader market, which returned 11.1%, and the US hospitality industry, which returned 9.1%. Despite these challenges, the company's focus on strengthening its earnings base, as seen with a switch from a loss to a US$380 million net income in Q3 2023, showcases its resilience..Discover whether Las Vegas Sands is fairly priced, undervalued, or overvalued in our comprehensive valuation breakdown..Assess the downside scenarios for Las Vegas Sands with our risk evaluation..Invested in Las Vegas Sands?

(NYSE:LVS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag..While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.. See our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Robert Goldstein, sold US$6.4m worth of shares at a price of US$53.73 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$43.37). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price..Insiders in Las Vegas Sands didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!.If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar)..Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Las Vegas Sands. Specifically, insiders ditched US$4.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap..Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Las Vegas Sands insiders own 24% of the company, currently worth about US$7.6b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders..Insiders haven't bought Las Vegas Sands stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Las Vegas Sands is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) stands against other best hotel stocks to buy according to analysts..The hospitality industry is undergoing a significant transformation after the post-Covid travel rebound. According to a report by Zion Market Research, the global hotel market is valued at $1.37 trillion as of 2023. It is expected to reach $2.99 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.14% between 2024 and 2032. This growth is attributed to the surging travel demand post-Covid, resurgence in leisure and business activities, and increased disposable incomes..Released in January 2025, the “State of the Hospitality Market Report 2024” provides a deeper view of the global hospitality industry. The report showed a significant rise from $3.44 trillion in 2023 to $3.98 trillion in 2024, translating to a compound annual growth rate of 15.5%. This notable growth highlights positive trends across transportation and infrastructure improvements, the increasing influence of international hotel chains, and the growing popularity of experiential travel. In addition, the rising economic influence of the middle class in emerging markets and ballooning demand for unique experiences is further boosting this expansion. According to the report, North America is the most significant force in the hospitality market as of 2023. However, the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to grow fastest in the coming years..The US hospitality industry reflects similar trends. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the industry is estimated to have a market size of around $247.45 billion as of 2025. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.87% between 2025 and 2030, reaching $313.87 billion by the end of the forecast period..A survey regarding US hotel investors’ sentiment conducted by the CBRE Group and released on January 28 showed increased positive optimism among hotel investors. Around 94% of those surveyed expressed intentions to maintain or increase their hotel investments in 2025, a rise from 85% last year. The most prominent reason behind this growth was an optimistic outlook for total returns and distressed investment opportunities. The central business districts (CBDs) and resorts were the most commonly favored location types for 2025 among investors. The most popular chain scales were the higher-priced options.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-corp-lvs-220755224.html

2025-02-11 18:20:00,Earnings Miss: Las Vegas Sands Corp. Missed EPS By 9.7% And Analysts Are Revising Their Forecasts,"Last week, you might have seen that Las Vegas Sands Corp. ( NYSE:LVS ) released its annual result to the market. The...","Last week, you might have seen that Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) released its annual result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.3% to US$41.67 in the past week. Revenues of US$11b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at US$1.96, missing estimates by 9.7%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.. View our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Las Vegas Sands' 16 analysts is for revenues of US$12.3b in 2025. This reflects a solid 8.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to bounce 26% to US$2.55. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$12.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.60 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates..There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$58.48, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Las Vegas Sands, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$67.00 and the most bearish at US$51.00 per share. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting Las Vegas Sands is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions..Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 8.6% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 11% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 9.7% per year. So although Las Vegas Sands is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-miss-las-vegas-sands-102016748.html

(NYSE:LVS) stands against the other stocks..Ken Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Asset Management, a renowned investment and financial analysis expert. He established the firm in 1979 and now has $299 billion in assets under management. Over the years, he has built a legacy of innovative investment strategies, a contrarian approach, and a focus on long-term growth..Compared with many other firms, Fisher Investments' most distinctive aspects are its methodical approach to portfolio management and its reliance on research. In his 1984 book Super Stocks, he popularized the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to find undervalued growth stocks. The ratio continues to play a key role in his firm’s stock selection process, helping to uncover companies with strong growth prospects that might be hidden from the broader market..Fisher’s contrarian mentality distinguishes him from most investors. He advises questioning mainstream market sentiments and looking for opportunities others might miss. His book The Only Three Questions That Count examines this more in-depth, explaining how good investors must constantly challenge their view of the world, find insights no one else sees, and combat mental biases to find the right investment opportunity..The firm’s holdings express Fisher’s long-held maxim that diversification helps reduce risk. Technology is a particularly strong-performing sector, accounting for 31.8% of the portfolio as of Q3 2024, displaying Fisher’s faith in the enduring rise of tech stocks. The portfolio is also heavy in other sectors, such as services (14.6%), financial services (12.3%), and healthcare (10.5%)..In 2024, Fisher Investments achieved an incredible 32.18% return, fueled mainly by its tech positions, especially in companies that benefited from the artificial intelligence boom. While many investors have become cautious about frothy tech valuations, Fisher’s firm has remained steadfast, doubling down on AI chipmakers and other tech innovators..In January 2025, Fisher Investments finalized the sale of a minority stake valued at nearly $3 billion to Advent International and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing the firm at approximately $13 billion.  The decision is a strategic move that has been a part of Ken Fisher's long-term estate planning, allowing the firm to continue its private independence and never-ending commitment to outstanding client service. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high growth stocks in Ken Fisher's portfolio.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-corp-lvs-183206042.html

(NYSE:LVS) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.. Check out our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years..A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:.2025.2026.2027.2028.2029.2030.2031.2032.2033.2034.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.2%, which is in line with the average for the industry.. View our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .Solid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Las Vegas Sands' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business..Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 74.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 22%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend..Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $2.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.00. The dividend has shrunk at around 6.7% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems..Given that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. Over the past five years, it looks as though Las Vegas Sands' EPS has declined at around 9.7% a year. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern..Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock..Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Las Vegas Sands that investors should take into consideration. Is Las Vegas Sands not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

2025-01-31 22:00:00,How to Find Strong Consumer Discretionary Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises,Finding stocks expected to beat quarterly earnings estimates becomes an easier task with our Zacks Earnings ESP.,"Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important..Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises..The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure..The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Hasbro (HAS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 20 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 20, 2025, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.38 a share..HAS has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.33%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.38 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.36..HAS is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider..Las Vegas Sands is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 16, 2025. LVS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.66 a share 75 days from its next earnings release..Las Vegas Sands' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.92% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.65..Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HAS and LVS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports..Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

2025-01-25 19:00:00,Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,"The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says...","The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?.Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.. View our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Las Vegas Sands had US$13.9b in debt in September 2024; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$4.21b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$9.67b..According to the last reported balance sheet, Las Vegas Sands had liabilities of US$5.35b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.4b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$4.21b as well as receivables valued at US$413.0m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$13.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables..This deficit isn't so bad because Las Vegas Sands is worth a massive US$31.5b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk..We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-nyse-lvs-110009889.html

(NYSE:LVS) stands against other best sin stocks to invest in 2025..Sin stocks are shares of companies involved in activities that are often seen as immoral or unethical. Such companies are involved in a range of sectors such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and adult entertainment. Some investors believe that sin stocks profit from human weaknesses and vices. While some ethical investors may be looking to avoid such stocks due to ethical concerns, others may see them as strong investment opportunities..It is important to note that sin stocks can offer unique benefits. By providing goods and services that people always want, companies involved in such sectors often thrive in tough times and even during recessions. Industries that may be seen as immoral or unethical like gambling, alcohol, and tobacco enjoy consistent consumer demand as people usually continue to purchase their products and services even during economic slowdowns. Some investors argue that this makes sin stocks relatively recession-proof..READ ALSO: 12 Best Gas Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Invest In. .In the US, the gambling market is flourishing. Since the Supreme Court struck down a federal law prohibiting sports betting in 2018, gambling and sports betting has grown remarkably. According to the American Gaming Association, sports betting is now legal and operational in 38 states and Washington, D.C. as of January 14, 2025. We could see more markets open up and legalize gambling and sports betting in the near future. Another key trend driving growth in the gambling industry is the surge in popularity of online gambling and iGaming. Online gambling is also attracting young bettors. According to a 2023 survey by the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), 58% of those aged 18 to 22 had placed at least one wager in 2023..According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global alcoholic beverages market was estimated to have reached a value of $544.19 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% during 2025-2029 to reach a value of $709.13 billion by the end of the forecast period. There is a growing demand for ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages and flavored drinks, especially among younger consumers. The demand for low-alcohol beverages and cocktails made with natural ingredients is also rising as consumers seek healthier options. The 2023 Bacardi Global Consumer Survey found that 44% of respondents in Canada and 43% of younger respondents in the United States plan to consume more cocktails made with natural ingredients in 2024. Additionally, consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for premium and high-quality products.

2025-01-21 19:01:00,Is It Time To Consider Buying Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS)?,Let's talk about the popular Las Vegas Sands Corp. ( NYSE:LVS ). The company's shares received a lot of attention from...,"Let's talk about the popular Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$55.17 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$43.98. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Las Vegas Sands' current trading price of US$44.40 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Las Vegas Sands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.. Check out our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .The share price seems sensible at the moment according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that Las Vegas Sands’s ratio of 21.4x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 22.95x, which means if you buy Las Vegas Sands today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Las Vegas Sands should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Las Vegas Sands’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity..Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 68% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Las Vegas Sands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation..Are you a shareholder? LVS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at LVS? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-las-vegas-110117659.html

2025-01-15 23:00:00,Las Vegas Sands (LVS) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Las Vegas Sands (LVS) possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,"Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price..The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower..While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise..This casino operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.8%..Revenues are expected to be $2.9 billion, down 0.5% from the year-ago quarter..The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.73% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period..Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts..Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)..The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier..Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only..A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-lvs-earnings-150031177.html

The goal was initially set at 150,000 hours, but was surpassed in just two years..""We achieved our original volunteer target through the tireless efforts of Team Members who accelerated their hours with pandemic-related service, as well as our ongoing community volunteer programs,"" Ron Reese, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs, who spearheads corporate responsibility initiatives, said. ""Thanks to their continued energy, enthusiasm and commitment, we're on track to reach the updated mark. We have a tremendous volunteer spirit in every region of the company."".As of the end of 2023, Team Members have contributed 222,823 volunteer hours and regularly support a broad array of volunteer engagements, including global signature events that cross Sands' geographies along with each region's hallmark events and community partnerships..Global Volunteer Programs.Sands has two volunteer initiatives that take place in each region around the world - the Sands Cares Global Food Kit Build and the Sands Cares Global Hygiene Kit Build with Clean the World. The company launched these programs under its focus on hardship relief to provide people in need with essential food and hygiene supplies..The third annual Sands Cares Food Kit Build took place this past spring, with a series of builds that kicked off in March at Marina Bay Sands when more than 330 Team Members, retail tenants and representatives from food beneficiary organizations assembled 5,200 food kits. The Food Bank Singapore distributed kits to nine local service organizations..The corporate food kit build in Las Vegas followed in April with Team Members assembling more than 41,000 shelf-stable meals in partnership with The Pack Shack to benefit Three Square Food Bank. Sands China completed the 2024 series in June when more than 280 Sands China Team Members and volunteers prepared 3,000 food kits that encompassed 21 tons of food supplies for Caritas Macau.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-volunteer-day-2024-sands-144500735.html
2025-01-15 19:00:00,Is Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s (NYSE:LVS) ROE Of 50% Impressive?,"One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will...","One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS)..Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.. View our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .The formula for return on equity is:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Las Vegas Sands is:.50% = US$1.8b ÷ US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)..The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.50 in profit..Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Las Vegas Sands has a superior ROE than the average (12%) in the Hospitality industry..That is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Las Vegas Sands..Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same..It appears that Las Vegas Sands makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.81. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-sands-corp-nyse-110033222.html

2025-01-08 21:00:00,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) Passed With Ease,"Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks...","Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away..In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.. See our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .Over the last three years, Las Vegas Sands has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. In impressive fashion, Las Vegas Sands' EPS grew from US$0.88 to US$2.07, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 135% year-on-year growth like that. Shareholders will be hopeful that this is a sign of the company reaching an inflection point..Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Las Vegas Sands shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 17% to 23%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth..You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image..In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Las Vegas Sands' forecast profits?.Since Las Vegas Sands has a market capitalisation of US$37b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$8.8b. Coming in at 24% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-130013888.html
2025-01-03 22:00:00,"Insiders At Las Vegas Sands Sold US$17m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness","Over the past year, many Las Vegas Sands Corp. ( NYSE:LVS ) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may...","Over the past year, many Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag..While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.. See our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands .Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Robert Goldstein, for US$6.4m worth of shares, at about US$53.73 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$49.90. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern..In the last year Las Vegas Sands insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!.I will like Las Vegas Sands better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying..Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Las Vegas Sands. In total, insiders dumped US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap..Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Las Vegas Sands insiders own 24% of the company, worth about US$8.9b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders..Insiders haven't bought Las Vegas Sands stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Las Vegas Sands is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Las Vegas Sands.
