It's not that other sectors can't make you money, but let's face it -- the modern world is driven by technology. Since the internet arrived, innovation and growth have gone hand in hand, and that's likely to continue with artificial intelligence (AI) hitting its stride..For investors looking to grow their stock portfolio significantly before retirement, it's hard to leave technology out of the spotlight..But that doesn't mean you should take huge swings, investing in risky stocks with a low chance of success. Instead, consider these proven winners that still have significant growth ahead..If you have savings of $300,000 after meeting your immediate and necessary expenses, then here are three stocks you can invest $100,000 each, and potentially grow these savings to $1 million or more over the next decade. That's an average annual return of 12.8% over 10 years -- a perfectly achievable benchmark if you pick the right stocks..If artificial intelligence is going to create trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming years as experts anticipate, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will almost certainly continue to perform. The company has cornered the market for data center GPU chips, with an estimated 92% market share. Nvidia has built a powerful ecosystem consisting of cutting-edge chip hardware, combined with its CUDA programming platform, which essentially optimizes Nvidia GPU chips for non-graphical workloads, like AI..Thus far, competitors haven't taken Nvidia down, and the company could continue to grow alongside the world's data center footprint. Research from McKinsey & Company estimates that the required capital outlay for data centers could hit $7 trillion by 2030. Furthermore, Nvidia has additional long-term opportunities to expand beyond data centers, to areas like robotics, where computing power would be needed at a localized level..Unless Nvidia loses its edge in AI, analysts see the company growing earnings by an average of 29% annually over the long term. The stock's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46 is more than fair for such high growth. So, if AI tailwinds continue as expected, the stock could realistically double or triple over the next 10 years as long as Nvidia remains atop the AI mountain.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-1-million-retirement-invest-150500342.html,High Risk  Long-term Investment  Speculative

It's the largest forex-focused deal the company has ever done, signaling just how seriously Taiwan's top exporter is taking the recent surge in the local currency. This is TSMC's third such issuance since 2024, but it towers over the others in scale. The goal? To inject more flexibility into its foreign exchange hedging playbook as volatility climbs. Taiwan's dollar recently recorded its biggest one-day gain since the 1980s a spike that's making headlines and stirring unease across export-heavy industries..That spike isn't just academic. It's hitting the bottom line. CEO C. C. Wei told shareholders this month that operating margins have taken a noticeable hit thanks to currency appreciation. TSMC earns in USD, but its cost base is largely in Taiwan dollars and when the latter strengthens, profitability compresses. With local authorities eyeing speculation and banks tightening margin requirements, analysts say this share issuance could give TSMC a much-needed buffer. Robeco's Philip McNicholas explained the logic: a capital injection like this makes it easier to manage new and existing hedges when market conditions get rough..TSMC's role as the go-to chipmaker for Apple and Nvidia only magnifies the stakes. Most of its manufacturing is local, but its revenue is global a setup that becomes fragile when forex swings hard. The decision to issue new equity suggests TSMC isn't waiting for conditions to normalize. It's proactively defending its margins and reinforcing its hedge lines, even if it means some dilution.

It’s the third such deal since 2024, and by far the largest. They occurred during periods when the Taiwan dollar tended to appreciate. The moves grant TSMC Global — the vehicle responsible for managing overseas investments and hedging — more capital flexibility in managing exchange rate risks..The capital injection is for general investments, mainly bank deposits and bonds, according to a separate statement from Taiwan’s Department of Investment Review. The purpose was for TSMC to shift its own foreign exchange holdings to the unit to help with hedging costs, the statement said..Recent strength in the Taiwan dollar has caused worries in Taipei about the economy’s heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency notched its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, spurring calls from the central bank to curb speculation. The cost of hedging swings has surged this year, with one-year implied volatility for the local currency hitting the highest since 2011 on Wednesday..“Generally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,” said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco based in Singapore. “Issuing new shares, and bringing in an immediate cash injection, may help companies manage the margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.”.“The US dollar cash can also be useful for companies’ overseas operations, which could also require consistent hedging,” McNicholas added..TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far the island’s biggest company and exporter because the majority of its production is domestic. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would translate into less of the local currency, or they would need to raise their prices overseas and risk denting demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html,"Currency Risk, Market Risk"

That's still small relative to the market leaders, but Oracle is growing much faster. Amazingly, growth is set to accelerate. Oracle expects cloud-infrastructure revenue to grow by more than 70% in fiscal 2026 as more data centers come online and its infrastructure investments pay off..The cloud-infrastructure business is now large enough that Oracle's overall revenue growth is likely to accelerate in fiscal 2026 thanks to that blockbuster growth. Revenue was up 8% in fiscal 2025 to $57.4 billion, and it should accelerate to double digits in fiscal 2026..Beyond cloud infrastructure, Oracle's cloud-software business is also growing swiftly. Overall, cloud-application revenue rose by 12% in the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion, with both Fusion Cloud ERP and NetSuite Cloud ERP reaching the $1 billion market. This is offsetting lower on-premise software license revenue and weaker growth in hardware and services..Oracle has undoubtedly found its niche in the cloud-infrastructure market, and it's aggressively building out more capacity to meet demand.

She was responding to a question about Taiwan’ recent curbs on Chinese companies, and didn’t elaborate on how Beijing would respond..Taiwan last week joined a yearslong US campaign to curtail China’s technological ascent by adding the country’s AI and chipmaking champions — Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. — to its entity list. That bars the island’s firms from doing business with the pair without a license, the first time Taipei has used the blacklist on major Chinese companies..The new restrictions are likely to, at least partially, cut off Huawei and SMIC’s (0981.HK) access to Taiwan’s plant construction technologies, materials and equipment essential to build AI chips, like those made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) for the likes of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)..Zhu condemned Taiwan’s decision as “despicable” and claimed it displayed President Lai Ching-te’s loyalty to the US government. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, Bloomberg News previously reported..“Attempts to decouple will not delay the progress of industrial upgrading on the mainland,” Zhu said, adding that such actions will only damage the competitiveness of Taiwanese enterprises and the island’s economy..Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek.Inside Gap’s Last-Ditch, Tariff-Addled Turnaround Push.Luxury Counterfeiters Keep Outsmarting the Makers of $10,000 Handbags.Ken Griffin on Trump, Harvard and Why Novice Investors Won’t Beat the Pros.Is Mark Cuban the Loudmouth Billionaire that Democrats Need for 2028?.Can ‘MAMUWT’ Be to Musk What ‘TACO’ Is to Trump?.©2025 Bloomberg L.P..By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's

At the same point in the day, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) was up 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was up 1.5%..TSMC is gaining ground today following macroeconomic and geopolitical developments that are helping to push valuations for tech stocks higher. The company's valuation is also getting a boost from a new market-share report..Following gains yesterday, tech stocks are continuing to rally today on indications that the Federal Reserve serving up an interest rate cut at its meeting next month is now a realistic possibility. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this morning that the central banking authority would continue to monitor inflation trends and the impact of tariffs, but he seemingly left the door open for a July rate cut. Meanwhile, recent comments from other Fed officials have directly advocated for the move..TSMC stock is also rising thanks to news that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire. The market has been weighing geopolitical risk factors lately, and the possibility that the war between Israel and Iran could spiral into a wider conflict involving the U.S., Russia, and China has been a concern that's tamped down on buying action despite some other bullish market indicators. With signs that near-term risk on that front may be moderating, investors are buying TSMC shares today..Earlier today, Counterpoint Research published a new market-share report on the semiconductor industry. In the Foundry 2.0 category, which includes both fabrication and nonfabrication products and services, TSMC continues to enjoy a strong leadership position..According to Counterpoint, TSMC claimed a 35% market share in the Foundry 2.0 category in this year's first quarter. The performance was in line with the company's market share in the previous quarter and represented a 0.9% increase compared to Q1 2024.

In addition, one Wall Street sell-side analyst wrote a very positive note on Broadcom specifically, and the outlook for its custom artificial intelligence (AI) ASICs.","Solid data on AI semiconductor growth powered most chip stocks higher today..Additionally, Broadcom received an upgrade from a Wall Street analyst..10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›.Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rallied 4.2% on Tuesday, as of 1 p.m. ET..Semiconductors were broadly higher, based on new data that confirmed strong growth in the sector. In addition, one Wall Street sell-side analyst wrote a very positive note on Broadcom specifically, and the outlook for its custom artificial intelligence (AI) ASICs..Today, research firm Counterpoint Research released its final data for the semiconductor foundry industry's first quarter of 2025. Counterpoint's data showed a solid 13% increase in foundry revenue, which the firm noted was powered by artificial intelligence chips, especially those made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing..That includes Broadcom, which has a large part of its semiconductors produced by TSMC, especially its custom AI ASIC chips that it co-produces for the large cloud giants. And if foundry revenue grew strongly in the first quarter, that could likely mean strong chip sales in the second quarter, given that foundries produce chips before they're sold..On that note, HSBC semiconductor analyst Frank Lee raised his price target on Broadcom today from $240 to a whopping $400 per share, representing 53% upside from today's stock price..The massive jump is based on Lee's conviction that AI ASICs will now achieve better-than-expected growth relative to prior expectations, perhaps taking more AI market share from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Lee increased his estimates for Broadcom's ASIC revenue to $28.4 billion in 2026 and $42.8 billion in 2027, which are 42% and 69% above the average analysts' expectations, respectively..No doubt, Broadcom has defied skeptics over the past five years and has regularly trounced expectations. That being said, the stock already has a premium valuation. Lee's $400 target is based on 32 times 2027 earnings estimates. That's actually a 10% premium to Broadcom's peak P/E ratio over the past three years. So not only does Lee predict better-than-expected growth, but he also puts an all-time high valuation on future earnings estimates to get to $400..That's not to say Broadcom can't do it; however, the stock is no longer a no-brainer to reach new heights in the very near term.

It’s brought together industry lobbies from the Crypto Council for Innovation to the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Even Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are finding common cause, along with predictable parts of the tech sector including chipmakers and wireless providers..The reason is that chips are now in almost everything: refrigerators and microwaves, tire pressure sensors and navigation systems, electronic bidets and sonar equipment and, of course, smartphones and computers. Tariffs threaten to snarl supply lines and jack up costs for consumers..“There’s a large mismatch between the amount of chips we use in this country in various products and the supply created here in the US,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview. “Putting a tax on those imports will simply raise the cost, and that’s not a good thing for consumers.”.Case in point is the marine association, which warns the impact would be felt by more than 1,300 manufacturers who face higher expenses for essentials like propulsion technology, engines and GPS systems..“These systems are not optional luxuries — they are fundamental to safety, function and performance,” the association said. “Many components have no US equivalent or are only available from highly concentrated suppliers overseas.”.The boating sector’s concerns were among comments from 154 stakeholders submitted to a Commerce Department review of whether to slap tariffs on chips as part of Trump’s campaign to redraw global supply lines and boost domestic manufacturing. Predictable tech sources weighed in, including chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp. But feedback also landed from a wide spectrum of sectors, along with trading partners like Japan and Brazil..The companies, trade groups and individuals who commented on the chips investigation largely signaled support for the president’s vision of deepening the US manufacturing base and expanding the American workforce.

The maker of microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs) is finally being recognized for its growing role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, with the shares soaring 69% above their early April low. But AMD still has a long way to go before returning to its previous highs. Despite the big step up in the past two months, AMD has still surrendered 20% of its value over the past year, and the stock is 43% below last year's high-water mark. .Wood isn't the only one warming up to AMD on Monday.

Plenty of stocks look like attractive investments, and they're often right in front of investors. Successful AI investing doesn't mean finding the next Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) or Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA); sometimes, it's just picking the proven winners and letting them deliver..That's why I think this trio is an excellent investment, as all three have a proven track record of delivering excellent results for investors. Three stocks that I think investors should load up on are Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). There's a common theme that unites these three stocks and makes them excellent buys right now..Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have built the AI products that we know and interact with today, and with its leadership position, that won't change anytime soon. Nvidia is continually innovating and developing the best GPUs possible, which has kept it at the top of the AI arms race over the past few years..However, Nvidia wouldn't be able to keep innovating without Taiwan Semiconductor's production capabilities. Nvidia can't make chips, so it farms that work out to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. Taiwan Semiconductor's facilities allow it to produce the most advanced chips in the world at an impressive yield, which is why nearly every competitor in the AI arms race uses its chips..Another company that uses chips from TSMC is Broadcom, which is involved in the AI arms race in two ways. The first way is its connectivity switches. These devices allow GPUs to operate independently from each other, and the information from each device is stitched together to form an answer to a workload that was split across multiple GPUs. Additionally, Broadcom partners with AI hyperscalers to develop their own custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs. XPUs can outperform GPUs in specific scenarios Broadcom and the end user have designed them for. While this technology isn't going to replace GPUs, it complements them in a well-rounded AI infrastructure buildout..While this trio has experienced impressive growth over the past few years, they still have a lot ahead of them, making them excellent investment options right now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-phenomenal-ai-stocks-investors-093000666.html,Market Risk  Industry Risk  Regulatory Risk  Operational Risk  No Credit Risk  No Liquidity Risk  No Country Risk  No Sovereign Risk  No Event Risk

DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S..It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy..Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%..Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets.

Taiwan Semiconductor is a chief beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race.  Artificial intelligence (AI) investing is still a major theme in the market.,"Nvidia's data center dominance has provided immense growth..Taiwan Semiconductor is a chief beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) investing is still a major theme in the market. Although some AI hyperscalers have had success rolling out AI models, they aren't making a ton of money from it yet. As a result, I think investors are better off buying shares of the companies benefiting from this spending..This makes shares of companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) excellent investments right now, and I think they are top AI stocks to buy with a little bit of June remaining..There's an old saying: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Applying this wisdom to the AI arms race makes it easy to see a parallel: the gold rush..During the gold rush, only a few prospectors struck gold and got rich, while many of them lost everything. On the flip side, those who sold pickaxes and shovels to the prospectors made a ton of money. That gives rise to the investment description of ""picks and shovels,"" which perfectly describes Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor..Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that excel at processing workloads requiring immense computing power. A GPU is different from a traditional CPU because it can process multiple calculations in parallel. Combining this attribute with the ability to connect thousands of GPUs together in clusters allows AI hyperscalers to create jaw-dropping computing capacity used to train and run AI models..Nvidia has an iron grip on the data center market, with most estimates stating that Nvidia has a 90% or greater market share in the data center GPU space. This dominance has allowed Nvidia's stock to prosper, as its revenue has dramatically risen since the start of 2023..Nvidia is far from done growing. It posted 69% revenue growth in Q1 and projects 50% in Q2..With Nvidia's clients announcing record data center spending for this year, it's no surprise that there's a ton of upside left. As a result, I think it's still one of the best AI stocks to own moving forward..Nvidia doesn't make the chips that go into its GPUs; that's done by Taiwan Semiconductor. Alongside Nvidia, Taiwan Semi also has several other notable names in the AI arms race as clients, as well as consumer electronics customers like Apple. If you've got a device that would be considered advanced technology, chances are there's a chip produced by Taiwan Semiconductor inside of it.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-111900503.html,Market Risk Industry Risk Company Risk No Event Risk Currency Risk No Credit Risk

On that note, let's take a look at 10 reasons to buy and hold this stock forever..TSMC is the clear leader in semiconductor manufacturing with roughly 67% market share, and an even higher share of advanced chips, estimated at roughly 90%. With that level of market share, TSMC has pricing power, and its customers have limited alternatives..The company has gained that market share over time, and it's unlikely to erode anytime soon..TSMC is in a great competitive position not just because of its dominant market share, but it's also benefiting from tremendous in its industry due to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and technology more broadly. That's a major reason why revenue jumped 42% in the first quarter, and future innovations should continue to drive chip demand..TSMC dominates the chip foundry industry in part because it was the first company to employ the third-party foundry model when it was founded in 1987. Over the years, that model has prevailed over the traditional integrated model..TSMC's collection of customers helps show why the company is so dominant. Among its top customers are Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom, cutting-edge chip-design companies and some of the most innovative companies in technology..Profit margin is one of the clearest indicators of competitive advantage, and TSMC shines in that category. In the first quarter, the company reported an operating margin of 49%, showing it has pricing power and economies of scale..TSMC is not only a dominant company in its own right, but its services are in such high demand as semiconductors are crucial for the global economy..As part of the CHIPS Act, TSMC is receiving $6.6 billion in subsidies, and it's received $2 billion from the Chinese and Japanese governments in recent years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-reasons-buy-hold-semiconductor-102300237.html,Operational Risk  Market Risk  Geopolitical Risk  Regulatory Risk

However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain.

The ideal stock would be a relatively safe company that has a strong chance of beating the market over the long term. After searching through my personal holdings, it's clear that one company fits the bill: Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM)..Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. It makes chips for companies that cannot produce them themselves, which is nearly every company. As a result, Taiwan Semi is tied to nearly every industry and trend. I think this makes for a compelling investment case, and it would be my only holding if I were forced to select a single stock..Among Taiwan Semiconductor's clients are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). While Apple may be at the forefront of consumer tech, the other three are in charge in the AI realm. This allows Taiwan Semiconductor investors to benefit from the use of more chips and more advanced technology. Investors also don't have to pick a winner in the AI arms race, as there's a high chance that Taiwan Semiconductor chips will be used in whatever device is powering the AI model..Taiwan Semiconductor has risen to the top thanks to its culture of continuous improvement and consistent delivery. TSMC is a company that its customers can count on and has proven that multiple times..Most recently, there has been a huge push to move some of TSMC's manufacturing to the U.S. Although President Trump has certainly pressured TSMC to bring manufacturing into the U.S., former President Biden also championed the CHIPS Act, which helped Taiwan Semiconductor fund some of its Arizona production factories. There has been massive demand for domestically produced chips, most notably from Apple and Nvidia, which both plan to use chips from the Arizona fabrication facilities..Moving more production outside of Taiwan limits the biggest risk associated with Taiwan Semi's stock: a mainland China takeover. Taiwan's politics are messy, and the threat of a Chinese invasion is always present. Should this occur, it would undoubtedly tank TSMC's stock. However, considering how much of the world's chips come from Taiwan, it would undoubtedly crash the rest of the stock market and potentially put the U.S. at war. While TSMC's stock will get smoked more than others, that wouldn't be an ideal scenario for owning any stocks, so I don't consider that as large of a risk as others might.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-only-buy-hold-single-093000216.html,High investment risk.

Each company has found a unique niche in the AI sector to exploit, and each has big opportunities ahead..Let's look at why these are among the best AI stocks to invest in right now for the long term..Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure. These powerful chips are used to help power AI workloads, and demand has been soaring..The company's wide moat, however, comes from its CUDA software platform. Nvidia launched CUDA two decades ago to allow developers to program its GPUs more easily. It pushed CUDA into universities and research institutions early on, which helped CUDA become the de facto software program for AI developers..In Q1, the company had an over 90% market share in the GPU space. As a result, where AI infrastructure spending goes, Nvidia is sure to follow. While a slowdown in data center spending would be a risk, right now, demand for AI chips is only getting bigger. This is being driven by cloud computing companies pouring money into AI infrastructure to keep up with demand; large tech companies and AI start-ups spending big to create new foundational AI models; and even countries making large investments to not fall behind in the AI race..As AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia remains a clear winner..Another company taking advantage of the AI infrastructure build-out is Broadcom. Rather than designing GPUs like Nvidia, it's been focused on networking components and helping customers design custom AI chips. It also added a software component when it acquired VMWare..Thus far, its strategy is paying off. Its Ethernet switches and other networking components help efficiently move data within huge AI clusters, making them an essential part of data center infrastructure.

It's a bit unclear to me exactly what proportion of that product might be affected. Is it all of it? Is it some some portion of it? But I I mean that's that's what struck me right away. .When we talk about this American tech that's going to China, what kind of American tech are we are we talking about exactly, Matt? .Yeah, so I'm thinking it's the semiconductor capital equipment. Uh so you you're talking about uh fly materials, you you're talking about lamb, um, and I'm assuming it's used in in some sort of process tech. So I I'm not sure if there's there's a point in in the sense that it's only the more advanced technology that that that's being restricted or if there's no cutoff point, um, but at least that would be my assumption. But again, there's there's not a there's not a ton of clarity around exactly what might be restricted. .Would you guess, Matt, if we talk about the kind of chips that might be impacted here, would you think it would be, you know, the latest and greatest chips? Would it be more memory, more logic? The kind of chips that would go into your car, your consumer electronics? What do you think? .Yeah, so if you're looking at at those Taiwanese companies, uh so you're talking UMC, uh you're talking Taiwan Semi. The the amount of manufacturing they have in China is is minimal, right? You're talking for both those vendors, low single digits. Um those are uh they're more mature technologies. So those would be the types of chips that would go into your car. Um but again, they have they have product elsewhere. Um I tend to think about them using those Chinese fabs to make product for China. So it just wouldn't really have much impact on us, wouldn't have much impact on their top or bottom line. On the memory side though, you you're talking much larger kind of portions of of Hynix and and Samsung output. And then certain products are are somewhat unique. So Intel's old memory fab which is in Dalian, China, it makes a high capacity NAND chip that really isn't comparable to what anyone else makes. Uh Hynix has been able to dominate the the market for high capacity SSDs. Um and so if that's affected, it it it has some real ramifications uh for the market since most of that product ends up in the US.

That’s come as they shift to focus on monetization of their loyal user bases while beefing up their podcast and live event offerings..Tencent Music has notched four-straight quarters of growth in revenue per paying user by successfully driving subscribers to more expensive plans. That’s a refreshing break from the frequent headlines on deep price cuts for EVs and e-commerce that has sparked volatility in China tech stocks in recent years..“Music is becoming more important to the lives of young people in China, and you’re not going to just save one or two yuan to abandon all your playlists and jump to another platform,” said Ivan Su, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. “The monthly subscription price — which costs about the same as a cup of coffee — is very low.”.The Chinese online music industry has consolidated over the past few years, leaving the units of Tencent Holdings Ltd. and NetEase Inc. in a virtual duopoly.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also known as TSMC, makes the actual chips that power everything from smartphones to AI servers. Lam Research makes the equipment that chipmakers like TSMC use to produce those chips. Both companies are crucial to the tech supply chain and have seen strong demand in recent years..However, with rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI), 5G and advanced chips, the question is: Which is the smarter pick for investors today?.TSM manufactures chips for the world’s top tech companies, including NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is known for its advanced production capabilities and has already moved into 3nm production, with 2nm coming soon. Its large scale allows it to handle rising AI chip demand better than most competitors..In the first quarter of 2025, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reported a 35% increase in revenues and a 53% jump in profit. Its 3nm and 5nm chips accounted for nearly 58% of wafer sales. AI-related revenues tripled in 2024 and are expected to double again in 2025. With AI likely to be a long-term driver, TSMC’s future growth potential looks strong..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also investing heavily to stay ahead. It plans to spend up to $42 billion in 2025, mostly on advanced manufacturing. This is up from $29.8 billion in 2024 and shows its commitment to keeping its lead in cutting-edge chip production..However, challenges do linger. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s heavy presence in Taiwan leaves it exposed to geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. While the company is building new fabs in the United States, Japan and Europe, these projects are costly and take time. Rising energy prices in Taiwan and weakness in the smartphone and PC markets could also pressure profits in the short term..Lam Research is also capitalizing on the same AI trends but from the equipment side. It builds the tools chipmakers need to manufacture next-generation semiconductors, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and chips used in advanced packaging. These technologies are vital for powering AI and cloud data centers..Lam Research’s products are not only critical but also innovative. For example, its ALTUS ALD tool uses molybdenum to improve speed and efficiency in chip production. Another product, the Aether platform, helps chipmakers achieve higher performance and density.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","TSMC (TSM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +8.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 10.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..TSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.28 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.8%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.74 indicates a change of +15.8% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for TSMC.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-130005824.html,Market Volatility Risk

The park may comprise production lines for AI-powered industrial robots, they said, asking not to be named as the plan remains private..SoftBank officials are keen to have the Taiwanese maker of Nvidia Corp.’s advanced AI chips play a prominent role in the project, although it’s not clear what part Son sees for TSMC, which already plans to invest $165 billion in the US and has started mass production at its first Arizona factory. Nor is it clear that TSMC would be interested. A person familiar with the chipmaker’s thinking said that SoftBank’s project has no bearing on TSMC’s plans in Phoenix..Codenamed “Project Crystal Land,” the Arizona complex represents the 67-year-old SoftBank chief’s most ambitious attempt in a career that’s spanned numerous bet-the-house bids, thousands-fold-returns and billions of dollars in losses. Son, who’s often expressed disappointment in his own legacy, has repeatedly said he means to do everything he can to hurry AI development..SoftBank officials have spoken with federal and state government officials to discuss possible tax breaks for companies building factories or otherwise investing in the industrial park, including talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the people said..The Japanese billionaire is also personally sounding out interest among an array of tech companies, they said.

The sell-off came despite the fact that the commentary did not mention Pop Mart by name..The warning stoked fears of a regulatory crackdown on the blind-box model, a sales strategy in which consumers purchase toys without knowing which character they will receive.

But, my next guest has some alternative ways to play artificial intelligence. I'm going to bring in Dan Newman who is the Futurum CEO. Great to have you here back in studio with us. .Hey Brad, good to see you. .So, let's talk about this because a lot of people have already piled into Mag 7, but you believe that there are other places that are non Mag 7 that they could find some exposure to generative AI and this broader kind of thesis that's driven the market for the past two years. .Yeah, I mean there's been nothing that has, you know, deemed more attention than AI. You've seen just the news in the last couple of days, whether it's Microsoft wanting to, or sorry, meta offering hundreds of millions of dollars to potential researchers to join their AI talent team. Or, you know, you saw Marvell came out yesterday with the custom AI Silicon roadmap and their stock is popping, we'll probably talk a little bit about that. Um, but you're seeing it really across the board. And then of course so many people have kind of felt like, well, did I miss Nvidia? And so the the question I get asked most by, you know, by clients, by the by retail investors and why we basically launched the Futurum AI 15, which is the extended list beyond is what else is out there besides maybe Nvidia, Microsoft, and meta? What are the plays, you know? And so, you hear about kind of what are the difference difference makers? So for instance, uh, companies like Avago, you know, Broadcom. Um, you know there's a $500 billion TAM, we believe, in the next four years for custom AI Silicon. .Yeah. .Um, Nvidia's going to get a lot of that, you know, Nvidia gets 92% of that market right now, we believe. Right. But they're not going to keep 92% in our opinion. They're probably going to fall to maybe 80%, 70%. So it still means Nvidia, by the way, can triple to $300 billion. There's going to be $100 billion that's going to go into custom. And so we have Avago, for instance, at as our number two name to play, because that $100 billion opportunity, that sits with the Google custom chips they're doing, sits with custom chips that companies like Open AI are planning to do. So that's one of the plays. Of course, you're seeing, uh, Brad, TSMC. TSMC, you know, people think about it as a foundry, and of course, it's a very big name and there's a lot of dollars invested in it right now, but people don't always make that connection that whether it's Nvidia making chips, meta making chips, Microsoft, and Amazon doing their custom chips, all of them are dependent right now on TSMC. And as much as I think the US needs a strong Intel, we aren't there yet. So, right now, TSMC has all the pricing power. So it sits at the very top of our list. And then there's some eclectic names, I'll pause here, but basically there's eclectic names like Oracle, that we put on there. You saw what a pop they've gotten, but they've absolutely nailed this AI transformation and they're in a perfect position. And just yesterday, XAI and Oracle made a big announcement together that they're going to be using X Oracle's infrastructure to train XAI models. .Right.

The stock trades for 237x forward earnings estimates today, prompting some to say it's gotten too expensive and may be set for declines.","Druckenmiller dumped all of his Nvidia shares last year and expressed regret afterward..He recently increased his position in another AI giant by more than 400%..10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›.Stanley Druckenmiller has shown he's a firm believer in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), as he's invested in several companies leading in this industry. Certain AI companies remain in his portfolio -- like Amazon -- but he's recently exited others..He sold two of 2024's biggest AI winners, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies. He closed out his position in the former in the third quarter of last year and sold all of the latter in the first quarter of this year..Investors don't know the exact reason for the Palantir cut, though it's reasonable to guess valuation may have had something to do with it. The stock trades for 237x forward earnings estimates today, prompting some to say it's gotten too expensive and may be set for declines. Druckenmiller clearly cares about this element because he's said Nvidia's high valuation pushed him toward the exit door..Even though Nvidia's valuation has indeed climbed, this billionaire said selling Nvidia was a mistake. ""I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale,"" he told Bloomberg in an interview last year, and suggested he would consider buying the stock again at the right price..Druckenmiller hasn't done that yet -- but it's something to watch for in coming quarters as Nvidia's valuation has come down quite a bit over the past several months. Meanwhile, this top investor just made a huge move on another AI stock that has a close relationship with Nvidia. Here's a closer look..First, it's worth keeping your eye on Druckenmiller's moves as he has a strong track record of successful stock picking. This dates back to his 30 years of delivering a 30% average annual return -- and never posting a money-losing year -- as head of Duquesne Capital Management. Now he's leading the Duquesne family office and oversees $3 billion, and his moves could offer investors some inspiration when they go shopping for stocks..What sort of big AI move did Druckenmiller make in the first quarter? He increased his holding of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) by 457% to 598,780 shares..TSMC is the company that brings some of today's most sought-after products to life: AI chips. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two AI chip giants, design their chips but don't manufacture them.

ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor can benefit from increased spending on AI computer chips.  Both semiconductor-related companies are projected to grow faster than Apple this year.","Apple is falling behind in the artificial intelligence field, and the business is growing slowly..ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor can benefit from increased spending on AI computer chips..Both semiconductor-related companies are projected to grow faster than Apple this year..10 stocks we like better than ASML ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a huge winner in the smartphone era, which it pioneered with the iPhone. Now, it looks to be at risk of falling behind in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and mixed reality. The tech giant failed with the launch of its Vision Pro product and has struggled to release any products related to consumer AI while the competition pushes ahead aggressively..It is time to forget Apple stock. Here's why you should buy two AI beneficiaries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), for your portfolio instead..Revenue growth has been stagnant at Apple for many years now. The iPhone is maturing, and while it is still a great product, there are only so many dollars floating around the world that can be dedicated to buying a smartphone. In the last decade it has released some successful ancillary products such as the Apple Watch and Air Pods, but these are not large enough to move the needle for a company with a market capitalization of $3 trillion..Management claims the company has not been resting on its laurels, but the results so far have been underwhelming. The iPhone is increasingly similar with each yearly update, minimal AI features have been added to its branded ""Apple Intelligence"" products, and the Vision Pro virtual reality headset was a flop. Other big technology companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are pushing ahead with these cutting-edge technologies, leaving Apple in the dust..Unsurprisingly, Apple's revenue growth has slowed down quite a bit as a result. This year, analysts project just 4% revenue growth for the technology giant, which will mostly come from software and services revenue. The stock trades at an expensive price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31 even though it is barely growing anymore. This leaves much to be desired with the stock's valuation. There is not much upside to owning Apple stock today versus other fast-growing technology players around the world..Speaking of fast-growing technology companies, we have ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC, for short). These are two players in the computer chip and semiconductor supply chains -- suppliers to Apple, it should be noted -- that are benefiting immensely from the rising spend on AI.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-buy-2-artificial-120000731.html,Market Risk Industry Risk Company Risk Regulatory Risk No Credit Risk No Liquidity Risk No Operational Risk No Reputation Risk

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the must-own stocks over the past few years, but we're still a long way away from full AI deployment, so many AI stocks are still worth buying, even at their current levels.","Nvidia is a key supplier in the AI arms race..Nearly all companies source high-tech chips from Taiwan Semiconductor..Meta Platforms' stock is only valued for its legacy ad business..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the must-own stocks over the past few years, but we're still a long way away from full AI deployment, so many AI stocks are still worth buying, even at their current levels..At the top of my shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three each tackle AI in their own way and could be excellent long-term investments..Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed to train and run AI workloads. Its market share dominance in this industry is impressive, with most estimates pegging it at around 90%. Due to unprecedented AI demand, the GPU market has grown massively, and Nvidia's growth has been nothing short of jaw-dropping..Nvidia put up impressive growth figures over the past few years, and although the growth rate is ""slowing,"" it's hard to say that seriously when Nvidia grew revenue 69% year over year to $44 billion in Q1. It also projects it to grow by 50% in Q2, underscoring its strength..As long as there's huge AI demand, Nvidia will be a successful investment. Even with shares trading at 33 times forward earnings, it's about in line with other big tech stocks. However, Nvidia's growth and potential are far greater than many of its big tech peers, which makes it a solid stock to scoop up in June..Taiwan Semiconductor is a huge beneficiary of the massive demand that Nvidia experienced. Nvidia doesn't have the ability to produce its own chips, so it outsources that work to Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia isn't the only company that does this; nearly every big tech company that makes hardware uses chips from Taiwan Semiconductor's factories. This allows Taiwan Semi to stay neutral in the AI arms race, while benefiting from the massive spending..Investing in TSMC isn't picking a winner in the AI arms race; it's a bet that there will be increased AI spending in the future. That seems like a surefire take, so the stock will stay at the top of my buy list for the foreseeable future..Another reason I'm a Taiwan Semi bull is its stock price. Despite benefiting from multiple tailwinds, its stock hasn't achieved a premium valuation. It trades at 22.9 times forward earnings -- the same as the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-091500328.html,Market Volatility Risk  Industry Disruption Risk

Keep reading for details about two of them..OpenAI may be the most buzzworthy AI company, but there's no question that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a leader in AI.

Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in..It's true that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity pose a threat to Google Search, but thus far, Google has held its own, continuing to grow..In fact, growth in the business has been steady, and Google Cloud has also turned profitable. Overall, its competitive advantages remain intact, and its valuation is attractive.

With its powerful parallel processing capabilities, Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the main chips used to run AI workloads. Nvidia's real moat isn't its powerful chips, however -- it's CUDA, its proprietary software platform that developers have been trained on for nearly two decades. Over time, Nvidia layered on CUDA X, a collection of AI tools and libraries that make its chips even more efficient for AI tasks..This combination of dominant hardware and sticky software helped Nvidia capture over 90% of the GPU market in the first quarter. As AI demand surged, Nvidia's data center revenue exploded, growing more than 9x in two years. That momentum shows no signs of slowing. Nvidia's new Blackwell chips are ramping faster than any product in the company's history, and demand for its full-stack AI ""factories"" continues to accelerate. In addition, it's gaining traction with automakers, offering a second potential growth engine..While a slowdown in data center spending is a risk, Nvidia remains the best way to invest in the AI infrastructure buildout..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), more commonly known as TSMC, has quietly become one of the most important companies in the world. As the go-to manufacturer for advanced AI chips, it's playing a critical role in the AI infrastructure buildout.

And there are plenty of tech companies that have done even better than that..If you have $5,000 you're ready to invest now, you could open solid starting positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ)..Let's take a look at each of these tech leaders to see what makes them stand out..Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the biggest recent development in the tech sector. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the main third-party manufacturer of semiconductors (chips) worldwide, and it produces an outsized share of the cutting-edge AI processors that are in high demand..TSMC's share of the global semiconductor market grew from 58% in the second quarter of 2023 to 67% by the end of last year, according to research firm Counterpoint. Second-place foundry services provider Samsung had just 11%..TSMC makes chips designed by many top tech companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. Their partnerships with TSMC are crucial to their operations..Surging demand for chips made using the most advanced process nodes has been good for TSMC's bottom line. It reported net income of $11.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 60% year-over-year increase. But what makes it attractive as an investment is that shares are still trading at reasonable valuations, especially compared to other AI stocks. As you can see in the chart below, TSMC is currently much cheaper than companies like Broadcom and Nvidia, based on forward P/E ratio..TSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts..Alphabet is best known for owning Google, which captures about 90% of the online search market. That's just one of its many widely used products and services, however. Others include Google Maps and Waze, the Pixel line of smartphones, Android (the top mobile operating system by market share), and Chrome (the most-used browser)..The most exciting part for growth-focused investors is Alphabet's developments in AI. The company's AI assistant, Google Gemini, is getting positive feedback from users and is currently third in market share. It's still far behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, but given how successful Alphabet has been in dominating other markets, I expect it to capture a much larger slice of the AI space.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-5-000-3-tech-074000906.html,Market Risk  Systemic Risk  Industry Risk  Company-Specific Risk

MU works directly with AI chip powerhouse Nvidia and its closest rival, AMD..Micron’s earnings and revenue growth outlook is staggering in FY25 and FY26. It also trades at a huge discount to Tech, though its stock has outpaced the sector for the last 20 years. .Micron makes DRAM and NAND memory and storage chips that are critical components within devices from smartphones to AI data centers. Its growth and innovations in a key segment of the semiconductor industry helped MU stock climb roughly 1,100% in the past 20 years to crush the Zacks Tech sector’s 770%..The company works closely with Nvidia, and it is expanding its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. as part of the larger reshoring boom. Micron is a vertically integrated semiconductor company. This means it designs, manufactures, and tests most of its chips in-house, unlike fabless companies such as Nvidia that outsource manufacturing to foundries like TSMC..Speaking of, Micron announced on June 12 that it is expanding its U.S. investments to $200 billion, including $150 billion for memory chip manufacturing and $50 billion for R&D, to boost domestic semiconductor production. .Micron, boosted by help from the U.S. government, aims to produce 40% of its DRAM in the U.S. On top of that, the “co-location of these two Idaho fabs with Micron’s Idaho R&D operations will drive economies of scale and faster time to market for leading-edge products.”.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.MU’s memory segment has been one of the most boom-and-bust parts of the historically cyclical semiconductor industry. Micron’s revenue has fluctuated alongside consumer spending and production cycles across smartphones, PCs, laptops, vehicles, and more..The rise of data centers and, most recently, artificial intelligence, could see Micron become a bit more decoupled from those business cycles..The company’s advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technologies are critical to AI because they provide the high bandwidth and large memory capacity needed to quickly move massive data sets for training and running complex AI models.

The AI revolution is spurring demand that is overcoming near-term political headwinds..Airbnb's name may start with the letters ""A"" and ""I,"" but it's going the other way. Its revenue is declining for the fourth year in a row..10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›.The generally rising market over the past few weeks have awakened the spirits of growth investors, and that's naturally also a wake-up call for Cathie Wood. The CEO, co-founder, and ace stock picker at Ark Invest was particularly busy on Tuesday, adding to 10 of her existing positions across her family of aggressive growth exchange-traded funds..I want to take a closer look at three of those expanded positions. Ark Invest bought some more Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) on Tuesday. Let's check out what Wood is buying this week..Tech investors know that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest foundry, commanding two-thirds of the global pure-play foundry market. It may not be a household name outside of tech circles, but it's still the eighth most valuable company by market cap among U.S. exchange-listed stocks..Business has been booming for TSMC. It came through with another beat in its latest quarter that it posted in April. Revenue rose 42% through the first three months of this year, or a 35% step-up in U.S. dollars. The bottom line was even better. Net income soared 60% in the first quarter. Earnings have outpaced analyst projections consistently over the past year. TSMC's net margin was a strong 43% for the quarter, debunking the myth that this a low-margin cyclical commodity play..Wood wasn't the only one feeling more bullish about TSMC on Tuesday. Susquehanna lifted its price target on the shares from $250 to $255, implying nearly 20% of near-term upside to the shares. The quantitative analyst firm notes that channel checks show that while shipments have been weak for the smartphone market, the boom in artificial intelligence (AI)-related wafer shipments is more than bailing out the weakness elsewhere. Foreign exchange swings may eat into the top-line upside on the way down to the bottom line, but the outlook remains positive for the leader with at least a few more years of market dominance in its leading-edge niche.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-cathie-wood-bought-155700737.html,Market Volatility Risk  Company Specific Risk  Investment Risk  Operational Risk

The DRAM segment, which accounted for a whopping 76% of the company’s top line, is getting propelled by the traction in AI data center, automotive, PC, mobile market growth and an increase in average selling price of products..Micron’s DRAM segment is led by its products like low-power double data rate and high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are experiencing a massive surge in use cases in AI workloads due to their higher capacity and low power consumption. Micron experienced a sequential surge of 50% in HBM revenues, crossing $1 billion mark in the second quarter of fiscal 2025..Despite facing challenges like low demand from its consumer-oriented customers as they are focusing on reducing inventory, the DRAM segment benefited from traction in HBMs and leading-edge DRAMs, which are in high demand among data centers. Micron is now refocusing its business model around high-growth data center DRAM customers and moving away from segments where there is seasonality..As the demand for its DRAM solutions remains high, Micron is now focusing on capacity expansion. The company is installing a new DRAM fabrication facility in Boise, ID, supported by $6.1 billion in funding under the CHIPS and Science Act. Based on these factors, it is quite evident that momentum in its DRAM solutions will persist for a long time..Micron anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $8.80 billion (+/-$200 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $8.81 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 29.33%..Although the global DRAM market is highly consolidated, and has few direct competitors like Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM and SK hynix competing against Micron for market share, Micron faces stiff competition in the broader market from companies like Western Digital WDC, Seagate and Corsair..In the global DRAM market, Taiwan Semiconductor develops HBM DRAM packages based on SK Hynix’s HBMs. In 2024, SK hynix and TSMC collaborated to collectively develop HBM4 and next-generation packaging technology. This collaboration has led SK hynix to adopt Taiwan Semiconductor’s foundry process to develop its HBM4, showcased for the first time in April 2025..In the broader market, Western Digital develops NAND under the brand name of SanDisk. It also develops consumer and enterprise SSDs, including NVMe like Micron, making it a strong contender.

While the move would help lower costs, the company needs much more than cost cuts to regain investor confidence.","Intel (INTC) is reportedly considering laying off between 15% and 20% of its foundry workers, which could impact thousands of employees. The layoffs come after a brutal 2024 when the once-iconic chip company eliminated 15,000 positions in its biggest-ever layoff..While we don’t have the official confirmation, the layoffs would be hardly surprising given the company’s focus on cost cuts amid mounting losses and cash burn, particularly in the foundry business, which has failed to take off significantly despite burning billions of dollars. In this article, we’ll discuss Intel’s outlook in light of the cost cuts and turnaround efforts..Trump Is Giving Tesla’s Robotaxis a Leg Up Ahead of June 22.

Notably, when his predecessor Pat Gelsinger took office in 2021, he also embarked upon “transforming” Intel under the IDM 2.0 strategy, which, in hindsight, we know did not go as planned..Intel continues to lose market share and is majorly losing out to Nvidia (NVDA) in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The pivot to the foundry business, where Intel makes chips for third parties under contract manufacturing, also failed to get traction while that segment’s losses mounted..Tan has spoken about building a “new Intel” and has stressed that there are no “quick fixes” to the company’s woes. He admitted that the company lost out on talent and has talked about the need to revamp the company’s culture by fostering a “startup” mindset..Sell-side analysts have been in a “wait and see” mode when it comes to Intel, which is reflected in its ratings. Of the 38 analysts covering Intel, 32 rate it a “Hold.” The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” by only one analyst while five rate it as a “Strong Sell.” Intel’s mean target price is $22.42, which is 7.8% higher than the June 17 closing price. Its Street-low target price is $14, implying downside of 32.7%..Notably, while Intel has slumped over 70% from its 2021 highs, it does not necessarily mean that the stock is undervalued, as the price action is not too out of sync with its financial performance. For instance, last year it posted revenues of $54.2 billion with an adjusted gross margin of 36% and adjusted net loss of $600 million.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intc-stock-buy-now-intel-152818184.html,1.

It was the first time Taiwanese officials have used that blacklist to sanction major Chinese firms, taking a cue from a longstanding US approach of blocking access to advanced technologies..The move also marks Taipei’s first public action on semiconductor restrictions since President Lai Ching-te pledged in April to address unspecified concerns from Washington about export controls. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, people familiar with the matter said, with a particular focus on enforcement of existing curbs. They requested anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly..A congressional committee focused on China, meanwhile, said after Taipei’s move that the US “must continue working with our partners to ensure the CCP’s attempts to illegally transfer tech are stopped cold.”.Taipei’s decision may be the first of a series of measures tightening the flow of technology to China, marking a departure from a policy of nurturing cross-Strait business ties. The longer-term goal may be to throttle supply of the vital components, silicon materials and plant construction expertise that helped transform Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. into the world’s most advanced chip operation..“This recent shift marks a substantive move toward strategic technological competition with China,” said Chiang Min-yen, an analyst at Taiwan’s government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology. “Compared to other tech democracies with similar industrial structures — such as Japan and South Korea — Taiwan is now taking a more decisive stance.”.Lai didn’t specify in his April comments what steps Taiwan would take in response to US concerns, but instead described a broader strategy to boost trade relations with the US. It’s unclear whether the Huawei and SMIC sanctions are related to ongoing tariff negotiations with Washington, or whether the US requested that specific step.

Companies that start projects by the end of next year can continue to claim credits for continuous construction after that date — a policy that’s designed to get sites up and running while recognizing that chip factories take years to build..The tax credit is one of the key incentives on offer from the 2022 Chips and Science Act, a bipartisan law that was a pillar of President Joe Biden’s domestic policy. The program also includes $39 billion in grants and up to $75 billion in loans for manufacturing projects, designed to boost the American semiconductor industry after decades of production shifting to Asia..The tax credit, which isn’t capped, was already likely to be costlier than those other forms of subsidies — a function of how much investment the Chips Act has spurred. In almost every case, it will account for the greatest share of Chips Act incentives going to any one company, including those that didn’t win grant awards. Major beneficiaries of the grant program include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc..President Donald Trump earlier this year called for repealing the Chips Act, but lawmakers in both parties have shown little desire to eliminate subsidies that provide high-paying jobs in their districts, in a sector seen as critical to national security. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, has continued to implement the grant program — while urging larger investments and reworking terms of awards that took months to negotiate. “We’re getting more value for the same dollars,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month..Bloomberg reported in March that Lutnick’s team had signaled to chipmakers that it could withhold promised grants if companies don’t boost the size of their projects. At the same time, Lutnick had expressed interest in expanding the size of the Chips Act tax credit, people familiar with the matter had said, though it was unclear by how much.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tax-bill-boost-biden-045901420.html,Economic Risk  Macroeconomic Risk  Industry Risk  Regulatory Risk

The long-term returns for the broader stock market are about 10% annually, which causes the market to double around once every seven years.","Taiwan Semiconductor is in a neutral position for the AI arms race..Management has given a bold growth prediction for the next five years..The stock doesn't have a huge premium attached to it..10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›.The long-term returns for the broader stock market are about 10% annually, which causes the market to double around once every seven years. So, if you can pinpoint stocks that can soar 150% over the next five years, you'll have a great chance of beating the market with some margin of safety built in..One AI stock I've identified that can achieve that is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semiconductor is the leading chip fabricator worldwide and has nearly every big tech company as a client for its chips. Thanks to Taiwan Semiconductor's positioning, it can accurately project years into the future, which is where the 150% return level comes from..If you want to add another stock to your portfolio or increase your current TSMC holding, now could be an excellent time before the market wakes up to Taiwan Semiconductor's substantial opportunity..Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, is a chip fabricator, and these orders are often placed years in advance due to high demand. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor's existing Arizona facility already sold out production through 2027, which means it likely has orders in its system for that facility through at least 2028. While there are some tariff concerns, semiconductors are exempt from reciprocal tariff levies as of this moment (although that could easily change). Furthermore, TSMC's CEO C.C. Wei stated in its first-quarter conference call that ""we have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far"" when commenting on tariffs..Taiwan Semiconductor is more than generous with information to investors, offering monthly revenue updates throughout the year. In April, its revenue (in New Taiwan Dollars) was up 48% year over year and 40% in May. These numbers can fluctuate from year to year depending on how many working days there are from year to year (there were 23 working days in May during 2024 while only 22 in 2025), but it's still useful to check in on TSMC to get an idea of any large demand shifts..Clearly, Taiwan Semiconductor is doing great, but the 150% increase projection deals with the next five years, not the next five months. Management's long-term guidance given at the beginning of 2025 was for the company to grow AI-related revenue at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% for the next five years. That means AI-related revenue will rise 541% over the next five years. Overall revenue is expected to rise at nearly a 20% CAGR. If it achieves that level, then revenue will increase at a 149% pace.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-no-brainer-ai-stock-094500567.html,Market volatility risk Company financial risk Market return risk Earnings growth risk

The economy hasn't been impacted by tariffs so far, and demand for AI-related products hasn't slowed a bit. If you've got $1,000 to deploy, I think you will be incredibly happy with the price you've bought these stocks at three to five years down the road..Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are at the top of my shopping list right now. Each of these investments brings something different to the table and creates a balanced approach to AI..Of these three, Nvidia represents the growth option. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the go-to computing device for nearly every AI hyperscaler. As a result, Nvidia's revenue boomed over the past few years and is still rapidly growing. In Q1 FY 2026 (ending April 28), its revenue rose 69% year over year to $44 billion, and revenue is projected to rise to $45 billion in Q2, indicating 50% growth. Although that's impressive, growth could be further bolstered by a trade deal with China that allows Nvidia to sell its chips there again or a significant AI buildout in Europe, which appears to be gaining steam recently..The stock isn't cheap at 33 times forward earnings, but that's the price you must pay to own a stock posting market-leading growth..We've only scratched the surface of the computing power necessary to run an economy assisted by AI, which will boost Nvidia's growth over the long run. There's still plenty of growth ahead for Nvidia, and the demand signals it's sending to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing back that up..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is a critical supplier to Nvidia, as Nvidia doesn't have the facilities to manufacture its own chips. So it outsources that work to a chip foundry like TSMC -- the world's top semiconductor foundry, boasting cutting-edge technology and best-in-class execution. Nearly all of the big tech companies are customers of TSMC in one way or another, and its neutral position in the chip world gives it a great view into the future, as chip orders are often placed years in advance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-buy-1-000-091500394.html,- Market Risk - Company Risk - Investment Risk

Under the restrictions, Taiwanese businesses will be required to apply for permits before exporting to the listed firms..The new rules were announced amid escalating US-China tensions over advanced technologies including semiconductors and AI. Washington has grown increasingly concerned about its tech being used in Chinese military applications. Just last month, the Trump administration restricted sales of chip design software to China in its ongoing trade war with Beijing..The latest move by Taiwan underscores its government’s active approach in working with the US – its largest unofficial partner – to plug any loopholes in tech restrictions against Beijing. China claims self-governing Taiwan as part of its territory despite having never controlled it..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, which supplies Apple and AI giant Nvidia, had produced microchips for Huawei until 2020, when the first Trump administration effectively banned it from supplying the Chinese company. Since the ban, Huawei has turned to SMIC – which has also faced US restrictions – to source chips..With US restrictions already in place, experts said Taiwan’s move to tighten the screws on Huawei, SMIC and their subsidiaries is largely symbolic. CNN has reached out to Huawei and SMIC for comment..“This reflects the Taiwanese government’s clearer intent to align its export control regulations more closely with those of the United States,” said Min-yen Chiang, a nonresident fellow at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology, a government-funded think tank in Taipei. “In fact, Taiwan is the second country in the world – after the US – to publicly place SMIC and Huawei on an export control list.”.Taiwan’s “proactive” step signals that the government recognizes the need to play an active role in cooperating with the American government and addressing the security concerns at stake, Chiang said..“From what I understand, the US government has long hoped that Taiwan would take greater initiative in regulating sensitive exports on its own, rather than simply following Washington’s lead,” he added.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-puts-companies-behind-china-080346636.html,1.

Not surprisingly, a lot of money is being spent on AI-related hardware and software to help capture some of this economic potential. Market research firm IDC expects global spending on AI infrastructure to exceed $200 billion by 2028, which would be a nice increase over this year's projected spending of $150 billion..On the other hand, the research firm expects the AI software platforms market to clock an annual growth rate of almost 41% through 2028. That's why now is a good time to take a closer look at the prospects of two companies that are taking advantage of these lucrative end markets and have the potential to deliver healthy long-term gains for their investors..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) offers a great way for investors to capitalize on the huge investments in AI infrastructure. Popularly known as TSMC, this Taiwan-based company is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world, fabricating semiconductors on a large scale for major chip designers such as Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Marvell Technology, and others..These customers are seeing terrific growth in sales of their AI chips, and that's having a positive impact on TSMC's financial results. For instance, all the customers mentioned above saw remarkable growth in their AI chip revenue in their latest quarters. Nvidia reported 73% growth in data center revenue for the previous quarter, while Broadcom's AI revenue jumped 46%. A similar story unfolded for Marvell Technology as well, driven by healthy demand for its custom AI processors..Importantly, all these companies are leaders in their respective segments, and their outlook makes it clear that they will be able to sustain their healthy growth rates. Broadcom, for example, sees a serviceable addressable market worth a whopping $60 billion to $90 billion for its chips over the next three years, and that's excluding the potential revenue it could pull in from the new customers that it is working with.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083500775.html,Market Volatility Regulatory Risk Economic Downturn

Yet it's not time to panic. If anything, this is a time to scoop up some great companies that are trading at relative discounts..If you're looking to add tech stocks to your portfolio, consider the following two companies. They're in good positions to return great long-term value..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), also referred to as TSMC, is one of the world's most important tech companies. It's the world's largest semiconductor foundry, with a market share in contract chipmaking space of around 67%..For perspective, the second-largest semiconductor foundry is Samsung, which has a roughly 7% market share..Instead of designing and producing its own semiconductors for general sale, TSMC manufactures chips on behalf of other companies. They come to TSMC with the designs, and it uses its top-of-the-line manufacturing facilities to bring those products to life. Its success with this model has made TSMC the go-to chip fabricator for well-known companies like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and dozens of others..These high-dollar clients have treated TSMC well, too. In the first quarter, TSMC's revenue increased 35% year over year to $25.5 billion, and its cash from operations increased 43%. Both gains were continuations of impressive runs over the past five years..The next few years should be lucrative: Management estimates that TSMC's revenue will grow at a compound annual rate of 20% from 2024 to 2029. If that forecast proves accurate, TSMC will be bringing in well over $200 billion by 2029..Much of this optimism stems from the surging demand for AI-capable semiconductors as the broader AI boom continues.

Despite its strong rebound and concerns about exuberant valuations, TSMC still appears attractively priced. Given how sharply TSM has bounced back, the stock could become the ultimate Tech play, with its best days still ahead..Many tech giants are currently riding the AI wave, but when it comes to TSMC, it’s more appropriate to say that the company is steering it. As the world’s largest contract chipmaker, it produces the advanced processors that Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Apple (AAPL) rely on to bring AI to life. In TSMC’s latest earnings call in April, CEO C.C. Wei revealed that AI chip revenue, which tripled in 2024, is expected to double again this year..This is currently a major tailwind for TSMC, driving a 41.6% year-over-year revenue surge. Specifically, advanced 3nm and 5nm chips, critical for AI’s heavy lifting, made up 73% of wafer sales. With cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) building AI data centers at breakneck speed, the company’s factories are running at full capacity, with no signs that demand is slowing down anytime soon..In the meantime, with AI entering the sphere of national security, TSMC has been incentivized to not keep its magic in Taiwan. It’s spreading its wings to secure its AI dominance and sidestep geopolitical risks. The company is investing $165 billion in U.S. factories, with Arizona’s first fab already fully booked by heavyweights like Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM). Here’s how all these giants stack up on TipRanks’ stock comparison tool:.Moreover, in Europe, a new $10 billion plant in Dresden, Germany, and a chip design center in Munich are positioning TSMC to capture the continent’s growing AI market.

The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA's Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?)..Of course, it's challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA's $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel's affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA's. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips..In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel's foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., or TSMC, and Samsung..However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel's chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions..Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s $7.4 billion.

If you had invested $10,000 in its initial public offering (IPO) in 1971, it would be worth $10.3 million today. However, that investment briefly blossomed to $37.9 million when the stock closed at its record high on Aug. 28, 2000..Yet Intel hasn't generated any millionaire-making gains since then. Over the past decade, the chipmaker struggled with market share losses to AMD in the x86 CPU market, persistent shortages and delays, and abrupt strategic shifts under four different CEOs. It couldn't leverage its dominance of the PC and server CPU markets to expand into the higher-growth mobile and AI chip markets, while its own foundries fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC for short) in the race to produce smaller and denser chips..From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Intel's revenue to have an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% as the company's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, tries to bolster its engineering capabilities, develop more CPUs with integrated AI features, strengthen the foundry business, and streamline spending..Analysts expect Intel to stay unprofitable in 2025 as it spins all those plates, but they expect it to turn profitable again in 2026 and grow its net income more than sevenfold in 2027..That's an optimistic outlook, but Intel could struggle to balance the rollout of its latest 18A chips with its cost-cutting -- which includes the divestments of its noncore assets, layoffs, and its dependence on TSMC to manufacture some of its new 2nm CPUs..The stock also still looks overvalued relative to its peers at 74 times its forward adjusted earnings. So instead of betting on Intel's eventual recovery, it might be smarter to stick with another millionaire-maker semiconductor stock with a brighter future: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)..Avago Technologies, the chipmaker that acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its brand in 2016, went public in 2009 at a split-adjusted price of $1.50 per share. A $10,000 investment in that IPO would be worth $1.63 million today..Prior to acquiring Broadcom, Avago produced a wide range of wireless, storage, networking, optical, and radio frequency chips. The original Broadcom competed against Avago in the storage and networking markets, but it also sold a wider variety of mobile, multimedia, and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chips. By combining those two businesses, the ""new"" Broadcom supplied a diverse mix of essential chips for its enterprise, industrial, and mobile customers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-intel-buy-millionaire-maker-080500283.html,1.

This positions the company to tap into new business opportunities that could help offset its current customer concentration..Beyond that, Qualcomm’s asset-light model allows it to generate very high returns on its investments, highlighting its operational efficiency, strong financial health, and consistent value creation for shareholders. This helps justify the company trading at a slightly stretched valuation when considering its operational profits relative to enterprise value..When looking for value stocks, one of the most important factors—if not the most important—is a company’s ability to generate consistent earnings. Examining QCOM’s balance sheet reveals a capital-light, high-margin model driven by intellectual property (IP) and characterized by heavy investment in research and development (R&D)..As a fabless semiconductor company, Qualcomm relies on external manufacturing partners such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) for chip production. Notably, only approximately 7% of its $55.3 billion in total assets is allocated to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which is relatively low compared to the industry average. This underscores the efficiency of its asset-light business model and the minimal physical infrastructure required to support its operations..Roughly 18% of its assets are classified as goodwill, indicating a strong track record of acquisitions, which is clearly part of its strategy to acquire intellectual property (IP) or talent rather than build everything in-house. One recent example is the $2.4 billion acquisition of the UK-based semiconductor firm Alphawave.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-qualcomm-qcom-long-term-220400493.html,1. Market risk 2.

The company took a $4.5 billion charge in the fiscal first quarter ended April 27 and said it would have recorded an additional $2.5 billion in revenue without the restriction..The stock later rebounded after the U.S. and China agreed to slash tariff rates on each other temporarily. Optimism also grew after the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, another export control on advanced AI chips..Related: Analyst resets Nvidia stock price target after CEO slams U.S. chip policy.News that Nvidia will supply AI chips to Saudi Arabia’s Humain, an emerging tech player in the region, also boosted the stock..On May 28, Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter results.

Is it a good buy now? Let’s see..Both Intel and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA produce graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for modern computing, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA’s CUDA software and Blackwell chips are highly sought after by developers and customers. The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA's Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?)..Of course, it’s challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA’s $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel’s affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA’s. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips..In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel’s foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, or TSMC, and Samsung..However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel’s chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions..Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD $7.4 billion. This serves as a clear indication that Intel is making strides in the semiconductor industry and is well-positioned for a comeback..Last but not least, Lip-Bu Tan’s appointment as the CEO of Intel has been well-received by market pundits, as his stint in the semiconductor industry has been productive. Tan’s initiatives to streamline operations, deliver a competitive AI platform, and spin-off assets would restore stability at Intel and help the company return to its past glory.  .With Lip-Bu Tan leading Intel’s foundry recovery and AI accelerators gaining ground among competitors through cost advantages, holding onto INTC stock seems judicious. Intel’s business revival is becoming more probable, and brokers are showing optimism by increasing the short-term price target for INTC to $22.42 (up 9.5%) from $20.48.

We're taking a look at shares here as of right now, they're moving higher on this news by about 3.4%. .Yeah, and this comes after a sigh of relief more broadly in the market after video earnings, of course, and TSMC as well for their part, the CEO reaffirming the company's guidance for sales to grow in the mid 20% range in US dollar terms for 2025. We are still seeing that AI chip demand is outstripping supply for this company as well. Uh and it's interesting to note that in the face of sort of these headwinds that we've seen for the broader chip sector really just starting to come out of a bare market for the course of the year, as there have been questions about what demand was going to look like amid the infiltration of some competitors in the space. Think deep seek that had figured out a way to power its AI for less, aka less chips, which would mean less producing of chips from the likes of TSMC. But obviously this May revenue surge is a sign of resilient AI demand and you're seeing that reaction in the share price. .Yeah, absolutely. Shares of TSM moving higher on the day. Plus we're also tracking this next company here, Global pharmaceutical company Insmed searching, uh surging right now after reporting positive results in a phase 2B study of a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension here.

The high demand for these chips has led to Micron’s HBM revenues crossing $1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, marking a major milestone..Since Micron’s HBM3E and HBM3E-12H variants offer significant power reduction in comparison to its competitors while also delivering higher memory capacity, customers have already placed a large demand for these products, resulting in Micron being fully sold out of its HBM supply for calendar 2025..The HBMs developed by Micron have a total addressable market estimate of more than $35 billion for the calendar year 2025. Now the company is focusing on HBM delivery agreements for 2026. It is worth noting that the largest AI-chip manufacturer, NVIDIA NVDA, announced in January 2025 that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. NVIDIA has installed Micron’s HBM3E 8H chips inside the NVIDIA GB200 system and HBM3E 12H chips in NVIDIA GB300..To top it all off, Micron is developing the next generation of high bandwidth memory, HBM4, which will increase the bandwidth by more than 60% compared to HBM3E. The company will ramp the production volume of HBM4 in 2026. With Micron experiencing a sequential surge of 50% in HBM revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and considering its future plans, it is quite evident that momentum in HBMs will persist..Micron anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $8.80 billion (+/-$200 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter fiscal 2025 is pegged at $8.81 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 29.33%..The global HBM market is highly consolidated, with a handful of players in this space. Companies, including SK hynix, TSMC TSM and Samsung, exist in this space. However, not all of them compete directly against Micron..While SK Hynix and Samsung develop their own HBM2E, HBM3, and HBM3E, TSMC develops HBM packages based on SK Hynix’s HBMs. In 2024, SK hynix and TSMC collaborated to collectively develop HBM4 and next-generation packaging technology..This collaboration has led SK hynix to adopt TSMC’s foundry process to develop its HBM4, showcased for the first time in April 2025.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TSMC (TSM)..TSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 72.7% and 18.2% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for TSMC here>>>.While the ABR calls for buying TSMC, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-tsmc-tsm-based-bullish-133006011.html,"Market Sentiment Risk, Overvaluation Risk"

Year-to-year sales increased by more than 17% for the 11th consecutive month, driven by a year-to-year sales increase of roughly 45% in the Americas.”.Earlier in the year, monthly sales dipped slightly due to concerns over the impact of the budget-friendly Chinese AI platform DeepSeek on U.S. tech firms. However, those worries quickly faded as analysts concluded that the fears were exaggerated..April’s strong numbers came after an impressive 2024, when global semiconductor sales reached $627.6 billion — a 19.1% jump from $526.8 billion in 2023. The final quarter of 2024 alone saw $170.9 billion in sales, up 17.1% from the same period a year earlier, and 3% higher than the previous quarter..The steady rise in sales has been driven by robust demand for chips in data centers.

(TSM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to TSMC (TSM). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","TSMC (TSM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +16.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 19.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..TSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.6%..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.19 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +30.5%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.55 indicates a change of +14.8% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for TSMC.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-ltd-130014051.html,Market Sentiment Risk

As the world's leading contract chip manufacturer, TSMC manufactures the advanced semiconductors powering a range of products from AI infrastructure to smartphones and automotive tech..Producing these chips isn't easy, as it requires leading-edge technology, precision manufacturing, and scale. Few companies in the world have the capabilities or the track record that TSMC does, and with competitors struggling, it has also garnered strong pricing power..As such, the company has become the go-to partner for top chip designers, thanks to its leadership in advanced nodes and packaging. Advanced nodes refer to manufacturing processes that allow more transistors to be packed onto a chip, which in turn boosts performance and power efficiency..Meanwhile, demand for high-performance computing, including AI chips, has exploded. With AI workloads growing, TSMC is expanding capacity alongside key customers to meet future demand..Despite its pivotal role in the AI supply chain, TSMC's stock still looks reasonably valued. For long-term investors looking to benefit from the continued growth in AI infrastructure and semiconductors in general, TSMC is a great stock to hold..Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) has undergone a quiet but powerful transformation under CEO Bill Ready. Over the past three years, the company has invested heavily in technology to turn its massive user base, which now sits at more than 570 million monthly active users worldwide, into a growth engine. Pinterest is no longer just an online vision board; it's become a shoppable platform with growing ad conversion capabilities..One of the big drivers behind Pinterest's transformation has been its embrace of AI. The company built a multimodal model trained on both images and text to better understand what users are looking for. This powers personalized recommendations, while a visual search feature makes it easier for users to find and shop for products they see in pinned images.

Alphabet currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18.6, a substantial discount to the S&P 500..There are two primary reasons for the discount in valuation..First, investors are fearful that the company could get broken up or face a substantial fine or a related punishment as it's been found to have a monopoly in both search and adtech. Separately, Alphabet also seems to be trading at a discount because of the risk that its search empire could be disrupted by an AI chatbot like ChatGPT or Perplexity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-might-not-own-094000976.html,"- Business Risk: High - Market Risk: Medium - Credit Risk: Low - Liquidity Risk: Low - Regulatory Risk: Low - No Risk: Business Valuation Risk, Credit Valuation Risk"

He’s already making aggressive moves to restructure the company, ramp up investments in manufacturing and AI, and put the foundry business at the forefront. Despite the plethora of both internal and external turmoil, INTC stock has managed to post a flat first six months of 2025..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.Tan is steering Intel not only to reclaim its former dominance but potentially to exceed it. I’m bullish on the outlook—but realistic, too—knowing it will take time for Intel to solidify its AI foothold and deliver meaningful returns in the years ahead..Since taking the helm as CEO in March 2025, Tan has wasted no time launching a significant restructuring to slash layers of middle management that have long bogged down Intel’s innovation and decision-making. The plan calls for reducing the workforce by about 20%—a tough but necessary move to streamline the organization and accelerate its agility..This isn’t just about trimming costs; it’s about making Intel leaner and faster. The company aims to reduce operating expenses to around $17 billion by FY 2025. While layoffs are never easy, Intel has grown bloated compared to rivals and now faces an intensely competitive market where survival—and success—demand swift action. As things stand, Intel lags behind its sector peers on several key metrics..I’m confident that a leaner Intel will be sharper, faster, and better positioned to innovate boldly and prove its strength to the competition. However, Tan must handle the workforce cuts with care, focusing on retaining key talent and maintaining morale through a strong, principled leadership approach..Arguably, Tan’s boldest move is his unwavering commitment to Intel’s advanced manufacturing, especially the cutting-edge 18A node (1.8nm) technology. Set to power Intel’s Panther Lake CPUs by late 2025, this breakthrough could dramatically boost energy efficiency and performance, potentially allowing Intel to finally compete toe-to-toe with giants like TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF)..On the foundry front, Intel Foundry Services (IFS) is gaining serious momentum. High-profile deals—most notably with Microsoft (MSFT)—to utilize Intel’s 18A process could transform Intel into a fierce contender in the foundry market. Securing a few more marquee contracts from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) or Apple (AAPL) would be a game-changer, sparking a significant surge in investor confidence and substantially lifting Intel’s valuation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-intel-intc-comeback-might-232100254.html,"Market Risk,  Operational Risk,  Regulatory Risk,  Company-specific Risk."

The closer these departments are to each other, the easier it is, and less time it takes, for people to travel between them and exchange ideas, and the more efficient the operation becomes..“You’re trying to put the chips as close together as possible, and you’re also putting in different solutions to make the connection between the chips very easy,” Dan Nystedt, vice president of Asia-based private investment firm TrioOrient, told CNN..In a way, advanced packaging keeps afloat Moore’s Law, the idea that the number of transistors on microchips would double every two years, as breakthroughs in the chip fabrication process become increasingly costly and more difficult..While there are many types of advanced packaging technologies, CoWoS, short for Chips-on-Wafer-on-Substrate and invented by TSMC, is arguably the best known that was thrown under the limelight since the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which sparked the AI frenzy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-key-chip-technology-crucial-220003557.html,1.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes rose by 5% and 8%, respectively..After bearing the brunt of precipitous sell-offs early this year, semiconductor stocks have started to stage a comeback. Last month, shares of Nvidia and Broadcom climbed by more than 20%, while Advanced Micro Devices surged by roughly 15%..Lagging behind the usual suspects, however, was Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). While the stock's 12% gains beat the broader market, they still trail the chip industry's leading names..Below, I'll delve into why Taiwan Semi looks like a great buy right now. From there, I'll illustrate how a $1,000 investment could wind up being a multibagger for patient, disciplined investors..Nvidia and AMD design chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPU). GPUs have the capability to run sophisticated calculations at fast speeds, which gives them an edge over traditional compute processes when it comes to developing generative AI applications..Cloud hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, as well as big tech giants Meta Platforms and Oracle, have been buying GPUs in droves over the last few years in an effort to build out data centers and infrastructure services. While the robust demand for chips directly benefits Nvidia and AMD, Taiwan Semi has been an indirect beneficiary of these tailwinds..The reason? Because Taiwan Semi specializes in foundry services that actually manufacture the chip designs from Nvidia, AMD, and many others. In other words, the largest data center businesses in the world rely heavily on Taiwan Semi's fabrication business..In the chart below, I've illustrated Taiwan Semi's revenue, gross profit, and net income over the last three years. As the slopes of the lines indicate, TSMC's sales and profitability profile are both steepening..To me, this signals two things. First, demand for chips is on the rise -- hence the revenue line is rising. However, the more lucrative trend is that gross margin and net income are accelerating in parallel with sales. This suggests that Taiwan Semi has achieved a fair degree of pricing power relative to competitors such as Intel.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-1-000-taiwan-semiconductor-130000207.html,1.

112,2025-06-07 17:00:00,3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy on the Dip,"Amazon's cloud computing platform is seeing a huge boost from its AI business.  Alphabet's stock has been beaten down despite solid results.  Three stocks that are still down at least 10% from their all-time highs that look like strong picks right now are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).","Amazon's cloud computing platform is seeing a huge boost from its AI business..Taiwan Semiconductor forecasts phenomenal growth over the next five years..Alphabet's stock has been beaten down despite solid results..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Although the market has recovered from its April lows over the past few months, a handful of dominant artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are still well off their all-time highs. The future is still bright for many of these companies, and I think now is an excellent time to scoop up some of these stocks while they're still down..Three stocks that are still down at least 10% from their all-time highs that look like strong picks right now are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). I think buying shares of this trio could be a winning move for investors, and now is an excellent time to initiate a position..When investors hear Amazon, they don't automatically think about AI, but they should. Amazon has deployed AI throughout its business, but that's not the reason I consider Amazon an AI stock. Amazon gets a large chunk of its profits (63% in the first quarter) from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business..AWS is a massive beneficiary of the AI movement, as its servers are excellent places to run AI workloads on, especially when the client lacks the resources or workloads to justify buying their own supercomputer. That encompasses nearly all companies, except for the AI hyperscalers, and there are still a lot of AI applications to be deployed at an average business. This bodes well for Amazon, as AWS is the most critical part of its company, given how much it contributes to its profitability..Amazon saw net sales in its AWS segment in the first quarter grow 17% from a year ago, with operating income increasing even faster at a 23% pace. It's critical for Amazon to accelerate this business unit. If it can achieve that, it will have an outsized effect on Amazon's overall profit picture. The current environment is favorable for AWS, so investors shouldn't be surprised if Amazon's stock continues to rebound as long as AWS posts solid results..With Amazon stock down around 14% from its all-time high, it still looks like a great value..Few companies are as critical to modern technology as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). Taiwan Semi is a chip foundry and fabrication facility for a wide client base. If you have a high-technology device (like a laptop or cellphone), chances are it has a chip from Taiwan Semiconductor. As a supplier to nearly everyone in the chip industry, TSMC has valuable insights into where the industry is headed.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-090000361.html,Market Volatility Risk

Moreover, TSMC's foundry market share has risen steadily from 58% a couple of years ago to where it is now. Looking ahead, the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips could provide tremendous upside for TSMC, sending its market cap well above its current level of just over  $1 trillion..Indeed, I believe TSMC could triple its market cap in the next five years..TSMC's advanced processing nodes are being used by numerous companies, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Marvell, AMD, and Apple, to fabricate AI-capable chips that go into data centers, personal computers, and smartphones. This puts TSMC firmly at the center of the trend of growing adoption of AI across multiple end markets..According to one estimate, the global AI chip market could clock annualized growth of 35% through 2033 as the technology filters through to more applications. TSMC itself is forecasting that its revenue from selling AI accelerators designed by the likes of Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Marvell could register a compound annual growth rate in the mid-40% range over the next five years..Throw in the proliferation of AI in other technologies such as smartphones, PCs, vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT), and it becomes obvious that this chipmaker is on track for terrific and sustained growth. For instance, according to a forecast by research firm Market.Us, shipments of generative AI smartphones and PCs are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 35% through 2029, and the deployment of AI in the automotive industry is expected to grow at a similar rate..Not surprisingly, TSMC is investing aggressively to upgrade its chip manufacturing and packaging capacity to make the most of the rising AI-driven demand in the semiconductor market. It is on track to invest a total of $165 billion in the U.S. alone to build advanced chip fabrication facilities, packaging plants, and a research and development center.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-211500417.html,Market Risk  Industry Risk  Company Risk

""That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters. TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down."".""If demand drops, TSMC's business could be affected,"" he added. ""But I can assure you that AI demand has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply."".Wei reportedly said that TSMC had expressed concerns about tariffs to the US Department of Commerce that levies could increase production costs in the US..Read more: Stocks that are trending today.""The US commerce department said this is open for discussion, but how long that will take remains unclear,"" he said.

NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN..NVIDIA Corp. recently achieved a milestone, following double-digit revenue growth in the fiscal 2026 first quarter and a business boom. Let’s explore this achievement and consider the NVDA stock’s potential for investment..On Tuesday, NVIDIA surpassed Microsoft Corp. to regain the title of the world’s most valuable company. NVIDIA’s shares continued to rally on Wednesday, with the Jensen Huang-led company’s market capitalization currently at $3.461 trillion. NVIDIA stock rose by over 50% from its low in April, leading to a market capitalization increase of over $1 trillion as investors showed renewed confidence..NVIDIA’s shares have experienced periods of volatility this year due to investor concerns about the sustainability of artificial intelligence (AI) demand and the Trump administration’s tariffs. However, better-than-expected first-quarter revenues, despite losing billions in sales due to the U.S. export ban on China, powered NVIDIA’s shares. For the quarter, NVIDIA posted revenues of $44.1 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $43.3 billion and significantly more than $26 billion in the same period last year..NVIDIA successfully overcame supply-chain bottlenecks to deliver its cutting-edge Blackwell AI servers to big cloud customers, including Microsoft. NVIDIA’s primary contract chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., or TSMC, confirmed strong AI chip demand. All these developments also helped NVIDIA’s shares trade in positive territory for the year, up 5.4% year to date..To enhance AI computing capabilities, cloud computing companies Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc., to name a few, are purchasing graphics processing units (GPUs), where NVIDIA has more than a 90% market share, according to IoT Analytics. This wide moat should continue to bolster growth..Moreover, the increase in popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the growing demand for the Blackwell chips due to their faster AI interface are expected to boost NVIDIA’s growth. At the same time, NVIDIA stands to benefit from the AI revolution in autonomous robots and self-driving cars.

As 2026 draws nearer, investors may want to tune out the noise and focus on what’s unfolding beneath the surface—a company poised to enter a fresh multi-year growth phase, fueled by its unmatched “NA EUV” technology and a rising tide of national semiconductor reshoring efforts. I remain bullish on ASML, as the company is still in the early stages of commercializing its core offering..Let’s begin with what might be the most open secret in tech: ASML has no true rivals when it comes to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. None. It is the sole manufacturer of these incredibly complex machines, which are essential for producing chips at the most advanced process nodes. Whether it’s the cutting-edge processors powering AI data centers or flagship smartphones, chances are they were built using ASML’s EUV technology..These machines don’t come cheap. A single EUV scanner can cost upwards of $200 million, contains over 100,000 precision-engineered parts, and takes more than a year to assemble. Yet, chipmaking giants like TSMC (TSM), Intel (INTC), and Samsung (SSNLF) have no alternatives—they simply queue up and wait..That exclusivity has allowed ASML to build a massive moat, not through pricing power alone, but through an unmatched technological lead. Even deep-pocketed rivals like Nikon (NINOY) and Canon (CAJPY) have exited the EUV race entirely. ASML doesn’t just lead the market—it is the market..Concerns about export restrictions, particularly involving China, have surfaced in recent quarters. While it’s true that China accounted for 29% of ASML’s 2023 revenue, no EUV machines have ever been shipped there. The tighter Dutch export controls—largely encouraged by U.S. pressure—mainly apply to high-end DUV tools. Though valuable, these sales were never the cornerstone of ASML’s long-term strategy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-asml-most-important-stock-232200846.html,1. Industry cyclicality risk 2.

Could it be the best bargain in the market right now?.When it comes to AI semiconductor stocks, there is no shortage of positive narratives surrounding the usual suspects: Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. These companies design graphics processing units (GPU) and integrated network equipment for data centers. This hardware is essential for developing generative AI applications, and megacap behemoths such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms can't seem to buy enough of it..But Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom are ""fabless"" chip companies -- they don't physically make their own chips. They outsource that part of the process to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, which turn their GPU designs into actual tangible products..When it comes to foundry services, TSMC competes with smaller players such as United Microelectronics and GlobalFoundries, as well as the likes of Intel and Samsung, which are integrated device manufacturers (i.e., they handle design, fabrication, and assembly in house). However, given that TSMC has an estimated market share of nearly 60% in the third-party foundry segment, competitors have a long, uphill climb to catch up to its leading fabrication operation..According to a recent report from global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, data center spending could reach $6.7 trillion over the next five years, and $5.2 trillion of that amount will go to AI-related infrastructure with the following breakdown:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-could-131300193.html,Market Volatility Risk Trade War Risk Company Specific Risk

Absolutely, for the benefit of the American taxpayer, for sure,” Lutnick said Wednesday at a Senate Appropriations Committee. “We’re getting more value for the same dollars.”.The Commerce secretary even suggested the administration may not follow through on some of the planned awards. “You will see that all the deals are getting better, and the only deals that are not getting done are deals that should have never been done in the first place,” he said..Read: US Chip Grants in Limbo as Lutnick Pushes Bigger Investments (3).Trump has urged Congress to repeal the 2022 Chips and Science Act that was a centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, though Republican and Democratic lawmakers have little desire to revoke a bipartisan law promising $52 billion in subsidies. Lutnick has previously signaled that the Commerce Department might withhold Chips Act grants to press companies to follow in TSMC’s footsteps and expand their planned domestic semiconductor projects..During his nearly two-hour appearance before the panel, Lutnick addressed a range of issues essential to the semiconductor industry, including the administration’s push to bring to the US more chips-related investment. He defended artificial intelligence deals with the United Arab Emirates unveiled last month during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East, saying the accords were crafted to spur complementary levels of spending in the US..The path for those AI agreements in the Gulf was opened by the administration’s decision to revoke a regulation launched during President Joe Biden’s final week in office that had drawn strenuous objections from US allies and companies including Nvidia Corp. and Oracle Corp. The so-called AI diffusion rule — aimed at denying China access to advanced semiconductors via third parties — would have taken effect last month and created three broad tiers of access for countries seeking AI chips, an approach that Lutnick assailed a “illogical.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-reworking-subsidy-awards-chipmakers-092611257.html,1.

A seemingly endless parade of earnings reports, economic data releases, and policy changes from the Donald Trump administration, can make it easy for something important to get overlooked by investors..Arguably the most-telling of all data releases occurred three weeks ago on May 15. This marked the deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides investors with a snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this case, the first quarter)..While Warren Buffett is the most-followed asset manager on Wall Street, he's far from the only billionaire investor with a phenomenal track record. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont, who closed out March with $22.7 billion in assets under management, has a propensity for making money in the stock market..Whereas Buffett is a staunch value investor, Laffont leans heavily into growth stocks and companies riding the latest technological waves, such as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution..Although Laffont ended March overseeing 70 stocks, just four of these positions (all AI stocks) account for roughly 30% of Coatue's invested assets. Interestingly enough, AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't among these top AI assets, with Laffont persistently selling shares of Nvidia over the last two years. Though Nvidia was Coatue's largest holding from April 1, 2023 – Dec. 31, 2023, a combination of profit-taking and other possible nefarious factors has led to a notable reduction in this position..In four of the last five quarters, social media titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been billionaire Philippe Laffont's top holding. Coatue's more than 3.75-million-share stake equated to almost $2.2 billion in market value at the end of March..While Meta is wagering heavily on an AI future, the lion's share of its revenue and profits are currently derived from advertising. In March, Meta's family of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger, attracted an average of 3.43 billion daily active people. Since no other social platform comes particularly close to luring as many people on a daily basis, businesses are eager to advertise on Meta's social media sites.

The company has gone on to become one of the biggest winners of advancements in generative AI, for which its graphics processing units (GPUs) are well suited. Druckenmiller has also been an investor in Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), which has used AI to improve its software and expand its market. Druckenmiller has also made a lot of money by investing in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) throughout his career, taking advantage of the cloud computing leader's growth..But Druckenmiller is shifting his attention and his money away from these AI giants. He sold out of Nvidia about a year ago (although he says he regrets that decision). In the first quarter, he got rid of his remaining shares of Palantir and trimmed his Amazon investment by more than half. In their place, he's buying a different company that stands to benefit from continued spending on AI development but whose stock looks undervalued..Both Amazon and Palantir are producing strong results as enterprise customers spend heavily on AI software and development..Palantir has seen its U.S. commercial business take off thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Businesses are expanding their use cases for AIP, and the service is reducing the need for clients to hire new workers. That has helped Palantir grow revenue extremely quickly without much overhead, resulting in strong earnings growth..Amazon remains the largest public cloud platform in the world with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company is seeing strong demand for AI services on AWS, and it's spending as quickly as it can to meet that demand, including plans to pour over $100 billion into capital expenditures (mostly for AWS) in 2025.

TSMC is a pivotal force at the heart of the AI revolution, playing a crucial role in powering next-generation technologies. The company is aggressively expanding its global footprint with major facilities planned across Europe, the U.S., and most intriguingly, the United Arab Emirates..For investors who recognize the strategic significance of technological leadership, TSMC is far more than just another chipmaker—it’s a cornerstone of global economic and national security. Given the confluence of positive factors surrounding TSMC stock, I’m confidently bullish on its chances of picking its way through the brewing geopolitical minefield to, ultimately, deliver strong shareholder returns for the next decade..From a financial standpoint, TSMC’s performance in Fiscal 2025 has been nothing short of exceptional. In the first quarter alone, revenue surged by 35% year-over-year, reaching approximately $25.5 billion. This impressive growth has been fueled by strong and timely demand from high-performance computing and automotive sectors, more than offsetting temporary softness in the smartphone market. Notably, TSMC’s cutting-edge 3-nanometer process has become a meaningful contributor to revenue, further underscoring the company’s leadership in advanced semiconductor manufacturing..Despite facing some operational headwinds, including an early-year earthquake, TSMC has maintained robust profitability. Non-GAAP gross margins came in at around 59%, significantly beating analysts’ subdued expectations. Management also remains highly optimistic about the near-term outlook, guiding for another strong quarter with an anticipated 38% year-over-year revenue increase in Q2..Altogether, this powerful blend of rapid growth and resilient profitability signals that TSMC is far more than a cyclical beneficiary. It is a foundational force in the global tech ecosystem, building lasting competitive moats and firmly establishing itself as the dominant player in semiconductor manufacturing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-defies-gruesome-geopolitical-odds-192100842.html,1.

Wei told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting that TSMC expects to earn ""record profit"" in 2025..Of particular interest to investors, Wei said he's ""not afraid"" that President Donald Trump's tariffs turmoil will keep TSMC from reaching this goal..""The impact of tariffs on TSMC is not direct,"" Wei said. ""Tariffs are paid by importers. However, tariffs will make prices higher and could drag down demand."" Regardless, ""overall AI demand is still very high"" -- indeed, higher than the production capacity to fulfill it. Thus, if U.S. buyers pull back on buying semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan, well, there are always other buyers elsewhere..Long story short, Wei is confident his company can continue growing sales in the mid-20% range despite tariffs threats. Because even if supply eventually meets demand for artificial intelligence applications, new markets are forming to create even more demand for the company's chips..Which markets? ""The chip demand for humanoid robots starts now,"" declared Wei..So demand for TSMC's chips shouldn't be an issue. But should you demand to buy some TSMC stock?.Maybe..On the one hand, a mid-20s growth rate compares favorably against a TSMC P/E ratio of only 24, suggesting TSMC stock is cheap. On the other hand, TSMC's free cash flow isn't quite as robust as its reported generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings suggest. The company reported $39.4 billion profit over the past year, but FCF was only $27.3 billion, meaning TSMC generated cash profit of only about $0.69 for each $1 in claimed profit..With a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of more than 31, TSMC still seems pricey to me..Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

Yet today's volatile macroeconomic climate, fueled by the Trump administration's ever-evolving tariff policies, necessitates choosing AI businesses that can thrive through this unpredictability..Three AI companies with the ability to do so are Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), commonly called TSMC. Amid an uncertain economy, these companies have demonstrated AI success, indicating the potential for prosperity over the long run when economic conditions improve..Not only that, but investing in all three gives you exposure to key segments of the AI ecosystem. Nvidia designs AI semiconductor chips, TSMC manufactures them, and Dell uses them in the hardware sold to customers. Here's a deeper look into each..TSMC is one of the industry leaders in AI chip manufacturing thanks to its cutting-edge 3 nanometer (nm) process. The miniature size involved in 3nm, which is about the diameter of human DNA, allows more components on each chip. This delivers superior microprocessor speed and computational power..The chipmaker's tiny tech has powered outsize sales growth. In the first quarter, its revenue rose 35% year over year to $25.5 billion, or 839.3 billion in New Taiwan dollars, as 3nm sales contributed 22% of income, up from just 9% a year ago..Despite today's macroeconomic uncertainty, the company expects Q2 revenue to reach between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion. That would be a substantial jump up from the prior year's $20.8 billion, continuing the strong year-over-year growth seen in the first quarter..Along with growing revenue, TSMC possesses strong financials. Its Q1 balance sheet boasted total assets of NT$7.1 trillion with cash and marketable securities of NT$2.7 trillion, and that cash pile alone eclipsed total liabilities of NT$2.5 trillion. TSMC's combination of advanced tech and financial strength make it a great AI investment..AI leader Nvidia is not immune to the current macroeconomic situation, but results for its fiscal first quarter, ended April 27, affirm that the semiconductor giant is still firing on all cylinders.

When investors dream of becoming millionaires, they often have grand visions of a stock that rises 100 times in value and turns a small investment into a huge winner. While those examples do exist, they're quite rare..Instead, investors should focus on stocks that can crush the market and accelerate their timeline to becoming millionaires. With this mindset shift, you can pinpoint great companies with an excellent shot at outperformance and increase your satisfaction through consistent success..I've got two surefire stocks that are well on their way to beating the broader market and would make excellent additions to any investor's portfolio..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) is potentially the most neutral way to play the AI arms race. It is the chip fabricator for many big tech companies, including the all-important Nvidia. Its technology is second to none, and two new chip generations are already slated for launch in late 2025 and 2026..Because TSMC is a supplier to nearly every company involved in AI, it has unparalleled vision into the future because chip orders are placed years in advance. For example, its existing Arizona facility has already sold out chip production through 2027, which is part of why it has announced an additional $100 billion in production facilities to be built in the U.S..Over the next five years, TSMC's management expects AI-related revenue to grow at a jaw-dropping 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Companywide, it expects revenue to increase at nearly a 20% CAGR, which is far higher than the broader market usually grows (around 10% per year)..To top things off, TSMC's stock isn't all that expensive, trading for 21.2 times forward earnings, versus the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 22.1 times forward earnings..When you combine market-crushing growth with cheaper-than-market prices, you've got a recipe for a stock that can dramatically outperform the broader market. That's why I'm confident that TSMC will crush the market over the next few years..Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) may be more controversial as a market-beating stock pick, as it has a decent number of rising headwinds.

Between earnings season -- the six-week stretch each quarter where most S&P 500 companies report their operating results -- and economic data releases, there's an almost overwhelming amount of information for investors to absorb. Occasionally, something important can fall through the cracks..For example, May 15 marked the deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- and you might have missed it..This filing, which is due no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, details which stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and (select) stock options Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. It can offer big-time clues as to which influential stocks are garnering interest or falling out of favor..While Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett is the stock market's most-followed money manager, he's far from the only billionaire investor known to move markets..For instance, Duquesne Family Office's Stanley Druckenmiller and Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel have exemplary investment track records of their own, along with billions of dollars in assets under management..What's particularly noteworthy about the first-quarter 13Fs from Druckenmiller's and Mandel's respective funds has been their approach to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Both billionaires have dumped the preeminent AI stock on Wall Street in favor of a company that's critical to enterprise AI data centers..With the analysts at PwC pegging the addressable market for artificial intelligence at $15.7 trillion by 2030, there's room for hundreds of businesses to get their piece of the pie. However, no company has been a more direct beneficiary of the evolution of AI than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).

Wei, speaking at TSMC's annual shareholders meeting in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, said the company had not seen any changes in customer behaviour due to tariff uncertainty and the situation might become clearer in coming months..""Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly. That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters. TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down,"" he said..""If demand drops, TSMC's business could be affected. But I can assure you that AI demand has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply."".In April, the company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, gave a bullish outlook for the year on robust demand for AI applications..Wei said TSMC had been talking to the U.S. Department of Commerce about tariffs, expressing concern early on that the levies could increase production costs in the country where it is investing $165 billion to build new factories, as some equipment purchased from U.S. suppliers is made in Asia..""The U.S. commerce department said this is open for discussion, but how long that will take remains unclear,"" he added. ""The real point is that we are in active communication, because only through understanding can they realise the consequences."".Wei said he had told Trump the extra $100 billion investment, which he announced standing next to the president in March, would be difficult to complete within five years..""He said, 'Mr Wei, do your best, that's good enough.'"".Asked about media reports that the company had been looking at building chip factories in the United Arab Emirates, Wei said TSMC had no plans for any such plants in the Middle East because it was ""not very likely"" they would have customers there..Domestically, TSMC's margins are being pressured by the recent appreciation of the Taiwan dollar, which Wei said had reduced its gross margin by more than 3 percentage points.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-says-tariffs-impact-ai-022459888.html,1.

A 13F serves as a public ledger, breaking down which stocks the ""smart money"" on Wall Street bought and sold during the most recent quarter..For the last few years, institutional investors haven't been able to stop buying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Chief among popular buys for most of the last two years are ""Magnificent Seven"" darling Nvidia and data mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR)..However, while combing through some recent filings and trading data, it would appear that some of Wall Street's most closely followed personalities are dumping Palantir stock and redeploying their gains into another AI semiconductor stock -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM)..I'll detail some moves made by billionaire money manager Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office and Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood as it relates to swapping Palantir for TSMC. Let's dig into why selling Palantir stock and buying shares of TSMC might make sense for growth investors right now..It's no secret that 2025 has been a choppy year in the stock market. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have each exhibited pronounced volatility, thanks in large part to an overwhelming cloud of uncertainty -- from tariff negotiations, mixed economic data, and guessing what policies the Federal Reserve might institute next. Nevertheless, it seems as if nothing can stand in the way of Palantir stock's parabolic run..Let's start with Cathie Wood's recent trading activity. While Palantir remains the fifth-largest holding across Ark Invest's exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the firm has been trimming its exposure to Palantir over the last month..Of note, some of these trades were required by specific regulations per the Internal Revenue Code. Essentially, the gains in Ark's Palantir position were so high that the stock had become an abnormally large position, and the rise in share price triggered a sale. What is unique, however, is that Ark continued reducing its exposure to Palantir -- even after the company delivered a monster earnings report earlier this month.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-stock-vs-taiwan-semiconductor-220000928.html,Market Risk  Company Risk  Regulatory Risk

As of the time of writing, the S&P 500 is basically flat for the year. .Although the landscape has shifted since 2025 began, stock prices are generally the same. That may worry some investors, but I'm focused on the long term, and it still looks bright for many companies. .If you shift your mindset from five months to five years, all five of these stocks look incredibly attractive, which is why I think they're solid buys for June. .Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a leading artificial intelligence (AI) stock, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) widely used in training and running AI models. However, we haven't come close to the computing capacity needed to run an AI-first business approach across the entire economy, which is why Nvidia cites third-party estimates that data center capital expenditures will rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028..That's huge growth, and the company will be a massive beneficiary from that trend because it gets the majority of its revenue from GPUs specific to data centers..The company crushed it during its 2026 first quarter (ending April 27), with revenue rising 69%. While some headwinds are brewing with its China business, Nvidia still offers a compelling growth case that makes me want to purchase more shares..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is an even more neutral way to play the AI race, as nearly all high-tech companies use TSMC (as its known for short) as their chip foundry. Its business model is to offer the most advanced chip production available to attract clients that want to have their chips fabricated. Because it isn't marketing its own chips to its clients, it removes the conflict of interest facing other chip foundries..Because it's one of the most widely used foundries in the world, it has phenomenal vision into the future, because chip orders are often placed years in advance. Over the next five years, management expects AI-related revenue to have a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and overall revenue to rise at nearly a 20% CAGR..That's impressive growth over five years, and the stock can still be purchased for around 21 times forward earnings, which is less than the S&P 500 trades at (22.1 times forward earnings). That's an incredible deal for a company expected to outgrow the market, making Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing a no-brainer buy in June.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-brilliant-stocks-buy-june-091500590.html,Market Volatility Risk

Notably, TSM is also the producer of Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell chip series, which has recently gained immense popularity..TSMC’s 3nm process currently represents the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry, delivering superior power efficiency and performance. Looking ahead, anticipation is building around the company’s upcoming 2nm and 1.6nm nodes, scheduled for launch in late 2025 and 2026, respectively..The 2nm technology, referred to as N2, remains on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. This next-generation process is expected to deliver a 10–15% improvement in processing speed at the same power consumption, or a 20–30% reduction in power usage at equivalent performance. Following that, the 1.6nm process is projected to further improve power efficiency by an additional 15–20% over the 2nm node..These advancements are especially timely, as data centers grapple with rising energy costs. The shift to more power-efficient chips is becoming not only a technological imperative but also an economic necessity. This positions TSMC as a key enabler in the ongoing global semiconductor upgrade cycle..Reflecting this momentum, TSMC has outlined strong long-term growth expectations. The company projects its AI-related chip revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% over the next five years, while overall revenue is forecast to grow at a 20% CAGR during the same period.

There are many great market-beating stocks out there. If you're looking for reliable, low-risk stocks that could deliver outstanding returns over time, I recommend Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)..Taiwan Semiconductor, or TMSC, manufactures semiconductors, usually interchangeable with chips, for most of the big companies you know and love. Indeed, 85% of semiconductor prototypes were created with Taiwan Semiconductor's platform..Today, it's enjoying incredible demand for chips that power artificial intelligence (AI), and because the company works with so many clients, it benefits from their growth. Client Nvidia, for example, continues to report robust sales, and the partnership with TSMC means it grows along with Nvidia..Revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% since TSMC went public in 1994, and its current goal is to bring that closer to 20% through 2029. The company also plans to keep gross margin at 53% or above and return on equity to be at least 25%. In the 2025 first quarter, revenue increased 35%, and gross margin was 58.8%, well within its active ambitions..In the short term, though, TSMC is expecting that to contract as it moves more manufacturing capabilities overseas. The company is investing $100 billion in an Arizona facility that should help it serve U.S. customers better, as well as create local manufacturing that will avoid trade wars..However, as TSMC gets that set up, it's expecting a negative impact to the gross margin. Long term, it expects U.S. operations to meet client demand better and lead to reduced costs..It's for good reason. Great companies often need to expand to manage soaring demand, and that's where TSMC is holding today. On the first-quarter earnings call, management reiterated that it expects demand to double in 2025, driven by data centers focused on AI training and inference. As new models drive down costs, it's expecting greater efficiency and more AI development, adoption, and usage. All of that will require TSMC's products, and it sees robust long-term opportunities..TSMC stock is feeling some pressure today due to the tariff situation, but it's a longtime market-beater with plenty of long-term potential.

What stocks did Coleman and his team load up on? Let's take a look..If a fund has over $100 million in assets, it is required to divulge its end-of-quarter holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Then, 45 days after the close of a quarter, that information is made available to the investing public through a Form 13-F. Although this information comes to investors a bit late, it still gives investors an idea of what the fund is doing, especially when compared to its holdings in previous quarters..During the first quarter, Tiger Global Management purchased a few big-time AI stocks. These included Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). All four of these stocks were already in Tiger Global Management's portfolio prior to Q1, so these represent further buys from Coleman and his team..Although we don't know exactly when the stocks were bought in Q1, we know that since the end of the quarter, each has risen in price. Are any of these four worth buying right now?.If you examine each stock by its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, you can understand how highly each stock is valued relative to the others..The first thing that stands out is that all four of these stocks are still valued at the bottom end of their trading range throughout most of 2024. So, even though they could have been purchased for much cheaper prices just a few weeks ago, they're still attractive considering their range..The second thing that stands out is how cheap Taiwan Semiconductor is compared to the other three. Taiwan Semi's stock can be purchased for under 21 times forward earnings, which is significant because the S&P 500 trades for 22.1 times forward earnings. This is a lower-than-market multiple, yet Taiwan Semi is expected to deliver monster growth over the next five years. Management believes its AI-related revenue can increase at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and its overall revenue CAGR will approach 20%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-chase-coleman-just-loaded-094500312.html,Market Risk Sector Risk Company Risk Valuation Risk

TSM’s strong industry positioning as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has enabled it to attract consistent demand from top-tier technology clients, ensuring robust revenue streams..Positive sentiment has only added to the stock’s momentum, with analyst upgrades to “Strong Buy,” increasing investor confidence, and a favorable news flow reinforcing TSM’s earnings growth and technological innovation. This alignment of bullish technicals, solid valuation, and growing market optimism makes TSM an attractive option for investors seeking short-term upside with long-term strategic value. With support firmly in place and catalysts building, a near-term move higher appears increasingly likely, offering a timely entry point into a globally vital semiconductor powerhouse..Previously, we have covered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) in April 2025, wherein we summarized a bullish thesis by Oguz Erkan on Substack. The author argued that TSMC’s dominance in advanced chip manufacturing and strong financials make it undervalued, despite short-term concerns over tariffs and slowing semiconductor spend.

An appeals court offered Trump a temporary reprieve from the ruling but the saga could delay negotiations with other trading partners that began after Trump announced a 90-day pause on the steep “reciprocal” tariffs that were rolled out in early April.

He expressed willingness to increase imports from the US, including energy, agricultural and military goods, to lower the trade imbalance. Premier Cho Jung-tai has said preparations for a second round of talks were underway..Chen said he remains confident that his government will reach a deal before the US pause is set to lift and will push for Washington to drop Taiwan’s tariffs “as low as possible.” He added that as a strong American ally, Taiwan should push for lower rates than those on others..“We want to be the special someone,” Chen said, adding that if other countries finalize the tariff at 10%, “being special means lower than 10%.”.Open The Market.Chen indicated Taiwan had some room to lower tariffs on some US goods such as automobiles, which are subject to a 17.5% levy..“I hope, as a consumer and a fan of the American car, we can have a lower tariff on US cars,” he said.

After all, these billionaires are called ""smart money"" for a reason..What I find helpful, though, is when portfolio managers admit that they may have made a mistake. To me, this sheds light into how these investors think, and what strategies they may hone in order to mitigate making the same oversight..Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office admitted that he sold Nvidia stock far too early -- going as far as to say that he made a ""big mistake"" in doing so..Since making these comments, Druckenmiller has definitely had multiple chances to get back on the Nvidia train. After all, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest did just that after she too sold the semiconductor darling prior to its epic rally a couple of years ago. Nevertheless, recent filings indicate that Druckenmiller may have accepted his decision with Nvidia and is seeking opportunity elsewhere..Let's dig into the new artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock that the Duquesne Family Office just increased its stake in by a whopping 457%. Now may be a lucrative time to follow Druckenmiller's lead..Per its most recent 13F filing, the Duquesne Family Office recently plowed into Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) stock.

Table by author..Sometimes when a hedge fund increases its position in a particular stock, you can begin identifying a pattern by looking at prior filings. In this case, however, I don't think these dynamics really hold up..A year ago, Druckenmiller's portfolio had zero exposure to Taiwan Semi. And while the firm did buy the stock during the previous two quarters, the position itself was relatively nominal. Looked at a different way, the most recent purchase of TSMC stock during Q1 is a clear outlier compared to the previous two quarters..While Taiwan Semi might not receive nearly as much coverage as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, or Broadcom, don't be fooled by its quiet reputation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saying-selling-nvidia-stock-big-141500250.html,1.

(Hint: It's Not Nvidia or AMD.),Cathie Wood has been pouring into chip stocks lately.,"Over the last couple of months, Cathie Wood has been adding more semiconductor stocks to ARK's portfolio..Per ARK's trading data, the firm has been taking advantage of sell-offs in Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices..And now, Wood has complemented her positions in Nvidia and AMD with another monster AI chip stock..10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›.Cathie Wood is best known for investing in emerging (if not speculative) technologies such as genomics and flying electric taxis. If you take even a cursory glance at her portfolio with ARK Invest, odds are you'll be unfamiliar with most of her largest positions..From time to time, however, there are mainstream opportunities that even Wood can't pass up. Let's explore how she has been investing in artificial intelligence (AI) as of late, and more specifically, which semiconductor stocks she has had on her radar..ARK Invest offers investors eight different exchange-traded funds (ETFs), each of which focuses on a specific theme. According to ARK's website, the largest positions in the portfolios include Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Palantir Technologies, Robinhood Markets, and Archer Aviation. Each of these companies has attracted a loyal following -- mostly from retail investors -- but Wood complements these positions with some more blue chip businesses..When it comes to mainstream AI stocks, she owns positions in ""Magnificent Seven"" cornerstones Amazon and Alphabet. My guess? She's hedging her more-speculative positions with cloud hyperscalers that are already proving just how lucrative AI-powered services can be for their businesses..Besides the above, however, I've noticed a little trend in Wood's buying patterns over the last couple of months. Specifically, ARK has been rounding out its AI investments with chip stocks. She appears to have rekindled her relationship with Nvidia during the Nasdaq sell-off earlier this year, and more recently, she bought the dip in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)..Now, the growth investor just pounced on another AI chip stock, and I think this might be her most savvy move yet..According to recent trading data, ARK bought a combined 241,047 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) between May 19 and 20. This is notable because it's the first major purchase of Taiwan Semiconductor by ARK in years..TSMC (as it's also known) specializes in foundry services. This is an important component of the chip development process because companies such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Amazon, Qualcomm, and many more all rely heavily on TSMC's fabrication process to bring their chip and system designs to life.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-goes-bargain-hunting-133000588.html,"Market Risk, Industry Risk, and Company Risk (Specifically Semiconductor Industry)"

TSMC is expected to deliver strong growth over the next five years.  Individual investors should monitor the activities of some of the most successful investors.,"The Duquesne Family Office purchased Taiwan Semiconductor shares in Q1..TSMC is expected to deliver strong growth over the next five years..The stock still trades at an attractive valuation..10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›.Individual investors should monitor the activities of some of the most successful investors. Billionaire hedge fund managers have access to more resources and information than individual investors, and following them is a great way to confirm decisions you've already made or generate ideas..One billionaire I follow is Stanley Druckenmiller, who runs the Duquesne Family Office. Every quarter, funds with more than $100 million in holdings must report their holdings at the end of the quarter. Then that information is made available to the public 45 days later in a 13-F form. The latest round of those was released on May 15 and included some valuable information..The Duquesne Family Office loaded up on my favorite way to invest in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race: Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), also referred to as TSMC. I think this is a genius move by Druckenmiller..The Duquesne Family Office didn't just buy some shares of TSMC; it loaded up. Prior to Q1, it owned just over 100,000 shares of the company. It has massively increased its position this quarter and now owns just shy of 600,000 shares. Its TSMC stake now makes up about 3.33% of its total holdings and is one of its 10 largest positions. So what makes it so bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor?.TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, able to produce chips based on the unique designs of its customers. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, as this way clients don't need to maintain factories or spend resources on developing chip manufacturing technology, and TSMC doesn't need to design or market its chips..Based on how TSMC is positioned, the company doesn't need a winning AI technology to win the AI arms race; it just needs its clients to spend heavily on the computing power that fuels it. An investment in TSMC is a bet that the world will use more computing power and more advanced chips over time. That's a no-brainer, which is why the company is at the top of my list for best AI stocks in which to invest..Because of Taiwan Semiconductor's unique position of being a chip supplier to nearly every company involved in the AI arms race, it has unparalleled access to information about demand. Chip orders are placed years in advance, as evidenced by TSMC's Arizona factory already selling out production through 2027.

In addition, a ""soft"" economic indicator in May's Consumer Confidence readings bounced back in a big way from its April plunge..Finally, several major chip manufacturers submitted letters to the Department of Commerce regarding upcoming potential semiconductor tariffs. Included was a threat from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) that significant tariffs could derail its announced U.S. projects. Of note, all three of these companies produce their chips at TSMC's Taiwan fabs currently..Semiconductors have been some of the most sensitive to the ongoing trade and tariff controversies of the young Trump administration. While semiconductors are a long-term growth industry, the industry can be quite cyclical. Therefore, concerns over growth slowdowns or recessions are likely to cause turmoil in these stocks..In addition, given the very-international nature of semiconductor manufacturing, supply chains, and materials, semiconductors are doubly sensitive to all the tariff uncertainty. Will chips be tariffed? If not, what about the devices they go into, which are largely assembled overseas? How about the materials and chipmaking equipment that chipmakers use -- for instance, EUV machines, which are only available from the Netherlands?.As such, the Trump administration's threat of 50% tariffs on E.U. imports sent these stocks downward on Friday.

162,2025-05-27 21:56:00,Why this Nvidia bull is 'anxious' ahead of earnings,"Chipmakers are in focus ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings report, set to be released on Wednesday. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh and Harvest Portfolio Management chief investment officer Paul Meeks join Morning Brief to examine the chipmaker space and discuss what to expect from Nvidia earnings. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.","Chipmakers are in focus ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings report, set to be released on Wednesday..KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh and Harvest Portfolio Management chief investment officer Paul Meeks join Morning Brief to examine the chipmaker space and discuss what to expect from Nvidia earnings..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..Nvidia results do out Wednesday, they're going to offer some of the latest read on demand for semiconductors and the AI trade on Wall Street. But is Nvidia the only name in the game or is competition heating up? Joining us now, we've got Paul Meeks, CIO for Harvest Portfolio Management and John Vinh, Equity Research analyst for Key Bank Capital Markets, who has an overweight rating on Nvidia and a $190 price target. Great to have both of you here with us. John, I just want to start with you. Can Nvidia maintain its lead against rival chip makers? .Yes, um, in the near to medium term, absolutely. They are ramping a new architecture called Blackwell, GB200, NVL 72. Um, you know, obviously there's some supply constraints related to the ramp, but it's a hardware plus GPU chip based solution that also integrates the the GPU into the CPU, which gives them a significant performance advantage over the competition. You know, the competition does have a roadmap that is expected to follow suit, but they're at least a year behind at this point. .And Paul, I want to get you to weigh in on this too. Do you think that Nvidia retains its dominance, and if so, for for what period of time? .I think that they will, and I agree that the manufacturing lead is at least a year, maybe longer. But as I think about what this company is going to say on Wednesday, I must say, particularly with the rebound that the stock has had all the way back to 134 with the all-time high being 150-ish, I'm a little bit worried that although they will most likely not just meet but beat slightly, will that be enough to appease Wall Street? And remember, part of the thesis here was their revenues were going to rapidly reaccelerate in the second half of this year. With all the geopolitical turbulence, I don't know if that's the case. And so what I do is I hold my stock, it's still my biggest position, but I am a little bit anxious going into this report. .Just to follow on that, Paul, what would you what would you need to see from a chip that actually appeals and appeases some of the requirements now in place, especially as Nvidia is planning for this China specific AI chip that might be a little cheaper? .So I'm glad that they have that chip because if it is allowed to pass through the sensors, I.e. the regulators, then that's a good thing. It's better to have some revenue at whatever gross margin versus none. But I need to see the company guide to revenue acceleration and also, are we at the trough of the gross margin hit? They took a gross margin hit due to ramping up manufacturing. All semiconductor companies do that. But I'm now thinking that the hit to gross margins might be pushed another quarter out. These are all transitory issues. They are not long-term or secular issues. So I still like it long-term, but those are some of my near-term concerns, Brett. .And John, I want to get you to weigh in as well on this idea that Nvidia is developing some kind of alternative that it will be able to sell in China. Um, do you think we'll get news about that more specifically tomorrow? And if so, how much revenue do you think they can recoup? .Yeah, I think we'll get some color on the call. Obviously, it's going to be a key focus on the call in terms of, you know, what's happening within China. Uh, so we do think that they are working on another China compliant chip. This uh, this new chip does not use high bandwidth memory, so there should not be any sort of regulatory issues with it. I mean, this chip is effectively similar to a workstation chip. Um, the issue is it's not going to fully make them whole and backfill. If you look at the $5.5 billion write off, it roughly translates into a $12 billion headwind. We think with the lower ASPs on this new chip, they can probably backfill 8 of that 12 billion at this point. .And so as you're thinking going forward here, the most investible AI play is, is it still Nvidia or and I ask that specifically, John, thinking about how far we've run thus far? Or is there another semiconductor play that has larger upside potential at this point, even though Nvidia has been the poster child? .Yeah, I don't think it's an either or decision at this point, but our favorite AI plays right now are going to be Nvidia and Broadcom. Right. Thematically, if you think about Nvidia, they're clearly the leader on the merchant AI chip side. Um, Broadcom is the leader on the custom AI silicon side, right? Obviously, their big customer there is Google with the TPU franchise and you know, at this point, you know, you're seeing both uh, both types of chips get significant amount of capex spend devoted behind them in terms of spending. So, and they're clearly the two leaders in the space at this point. .Um, Paul, I think John brings up an interesting point, which is that it's not necessarily zero sum, right? Even though Nvidia has been very dominant, you know, how much room is there for other players to also do very well? And more to the point, to be a good buy right now? .Well, I think there's a lot of room for players to be great, but the problem is, can you execute to close that what I think is about a year and a half of manufacturing gap. And so the demand will be there, the demand will be voracious, and I do think AMD will ramp up and be a strong number two player, but as I start to winnow down my AI hardware and semiconductor bets, I still come to, as John said, Broadcom, Nvidia, then I would add for my big three Taiwan Semiconductor. .John, Paul, thank you so much. I know that you guys will be watching those numbers very closely tomorrow afternoon, as will we. Really appreciate it. .Thank you. .Great, thanks for having us.

163,2025-05-27 21:00:00,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Zacks.com users have recently been watching TSMC (TSM) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","TSMC (TSM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this chip company have returned +17.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, to which TSMC belongs, has gained 16.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..TSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.6%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.19 points to a change of +30.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.1%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.55 indicates a change of +14.8% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TSMC is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-ltd-130014901.html,Company-specific risk

If this is true, then investors are certainly going to want to jump onto stocks of AI leaders and hold for the long term..Let's look at four AI growth stocks to buy now..Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure thanks to their fast processing speeds, making them well-suited for running processor-intensive AI workloads. Meanwhile, the company has created a wide moat against potential competitors with the help of its CUDA software platform..Nvidia originally created the software platform to allow developers to program its chips for tasks outside their original purpose of speeding up graphics rendering in video in an effort to expand the market of GPUs. However, it didn't stop there, and in the years since, it has built a collection of high-performance computing libraries and tools that help improve the performance of its chips with AI tasks. This has led it to take a dominant market share of more than 80% in the GPU space..As such, the company has become the biggest beneficiary of the AI data center build-out. Where AI spending goes, Nvidia's revenue and profits are sure to follow. This is both the biggest opportunity and risk for the company moving forward, but at this time, spending continues to rise as cloud-computing companies, AI model start-ups, large enterprises, and even countries pour money into the space so as not to be left behind..Data gathering and analytics provider Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) has become one of the best growth stories in AI. Instead of trying to create the best AI model, Palantir has instead focused its efforts on garnering the power of these AI models to help solve real-world problems. It does this by gathering data from a multitude of sources and structuring it into an ""ontology,"" linking data to real-world objects and processes..While Nvidia's GPUs serve as the backbone of AI infrastructure, Palantir's AI Platform (AIP) serves as the backbone for how organizations actually use AI in the real world. AIP helps customers connect AI models to their data and workflows to solve practical business problems. More recently, Palantir has rolled out AI agents within AIP, which can automate processes and even take action, pushing AI from insight to execution.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-brilliant-growth-stocks-buy-082000076.html,Market Risk  Sector Risk  Industry Risk  Company Specific Risk  Operational Risk  No Credit Risk  Systematic Risk  High Liquidity Risk

Her flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK)  underperformed the S&P 500 index amid broader market volatility..Year-to-date, ARKK is down 2.67%, slightly worse than the S&P 500’s loss of 1.34%..Wood gained a remarkable 153% in 2020, which helped build her reputation and attract loyal investors. Still, her long-term performance has made many others skeptical of her aggressive style..As of May 23, Ark Innovation ETF, with $5 billion under management, has delivered a five-year annualized return of negative 1.75%. In comparison, the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 16.20% over the same period..Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics..Wood says these companies have the potential to reshape industries, but their volatility leads to major fluctuations in Ark funds' values..Related: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income.The Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth over the 10 years ending in 2024, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott.

Although there are concerns about Taiwan's geographical location, the company is taking steps to ease them. While it's doing that, there's a massive demand for chips, and TSMC is rolling out new technology later this year and next to meet that need..If you weren't aware already, TSMC makes the actual chips for most all the biggest semiconductor companies. Because of that neutral stance in the chip world, I think it's one of the best ways to play nearly every technological trend. When you trace almost every technology back to its chip roots, many roads lead to TSMC, which is why I'm so bullish..I've got four reasons investors should buy Taiwan Semiconductor's stock like there's no tomorrow, although there are likely many more out there..Two risks are typically discussed when discussing TSMC's stock: tariffs and China. There's a fear that China could take over Taiwan, but this move would send markets around the world into disarray. Tariffs are another concern, but currently there aren't any on semiconductors..While these two fears may not be an issue now, that doesn't mean they won't be in the future. To get ahead of that, Taiwan Semiconductor is diversifying its global footprint. It already has a $65 billion facility in the U.S., but it's deploying an additional $100 billion to build even more production capacity. TSMC is also building facilities in Germany and Japan, which helps decrease the risk of generating nearly all of its revenue from Taiwan..By increasing U.S. production, it's also decreasing its chances of being affected by tariffs. The demand for U.S.-produced chips is already high, and the Arizona facility has already sold out production capacity through 2027. Taiwan Semiconductor is making smart moves by investing in areas outside of Taiwan. This reduces a ton of risk with the stock..Although TSMC already has industry-leading 3 nanometer chips available, it's slated to launch 2nm and 1.6nm chips in late 2025 and 2026, respectively. While these chips can be configured to have greater speed, power consumption is the real innovation with these two technologies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-buy-taiwan-semiconductor-093000214.html,Geopolitical risk  Country risk  Industry risk  Operational risk

But AI hype has pushed up stock prices for several tech companies and inflated their valuations in many cases..Fortunately, investors looking for AI bargains can still find some. One of these is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, which Nvidia employs to construct its AI chips. Two others are Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly called Supermicro, and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)..Looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of these three AI stocks compared to Nvidia reveals that they are trading at much lower valuations at the time of writing..These three companies saw downward pressure on their share prices because of various headwinds. A big one is the global economic uncertainty introduced by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. But the secular trend of AI promises to boost each company's business over the long run. Beyond their relatively cheap valuations, here's why each is a buy..TSMC is a compelling investment because of its leadership in manufacturing chips used to process AI tasks. Its expertise in efficiently producing 3-nanometer (nm) chips in large quantities is leading to rapid sales growth. This tech contributed 22% of the company's $25.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, up from just 9% in the prior year..Although it's seeing success with its 3nm technology, TSMC is already looking to the next step. The manufacturer is working on its next-generation tech, 2nm, which it expects to enter production later this year..TSMC's technological achievements helped it grow Q1 sales by a strong 35% year over year to $25.5 billion. Moreover, its Q1 gross margin rose to 58.8%, up from 53.1% in the previous year, demonstrating efficiency in managing costs..Although the dynamic situation with tariffs introduces possible volatility into TSMC's business in the near term, the company forecast Q2 revenue to reach between $28.4 billion to $29.2 billion. That would be an outstanding increase of at least 37% from the prior year's $20.8 billion..Also, TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion in federal government funding as part of the CHIPS Act to build semiconductor fabrication facilities in the United States.

Over a 30-year period, which included 12 years working as a portfolio manager for George Soros at the Quant Fund, Druckenmiller generated average annual returns of 30%, according to Hedge Fund Alpha..Today, Druckenmiller is still investing his own money through his family's fund, Duquesne Capital Management. In the first quarter of the year, Druckenmiller slashed his position in the electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) by about 50% and more than quadrupled his stake in another artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 2,800% since its initial public offering (IPO)..Filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Duquesne lowered its stake in Tesla by about 50% and now holds about 18.8 million shares. Following President Donald Trump's election victory in November, shares of Tesla rocketed higher as investors believed the stock would benefit from CEO Elon Musk's close relationship to the president..However, in the first quarter of the year, most of those gains evaporated, as Tesla's core electric-vehicle (EV) business struggled and investors worried about how Musk's foray into politics might impact the brand..Druckenmiller is certainly a believer in AI but also remains disciplined on valuation, as his past investments have showed. The legendary investor didn't hesitate to sell the AI chip giant Nvidia when he thought that valuation rose to unsustainable levels..Tesla always traded at a nosebleed valuation due to Musk's larger-than-life brand and the company's promising future initiatives. These include full-self-driving (FSD) technology and the Optimus robots that will supposedly be able to complete regular household chores..All eyes are now on an upcoming FSD demonstration in Austin some time in June that could renew investor excitement for the stock. But with the core EV business still struggling, particularly in China, where competitors like BYD have taken significant market share, Tesla needs to keep future initiatives on track to maintain its high valuation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-investor-stanley-druckenmiller-just-094500172.html,1.

Every stock has its bear and bull cases, but the key is to find one with a far more certain bull than bear case. If I use those criteria to select my top AI stock to buy right now, I come up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) as my top pick..Regardless of what computing hardware a company uses for AI, the road likely leads back to Taiwan Semiconductor. Management is also incredibly bullish on the future, and it has great information that allows it to see a few years into the future..Taiwan Semiconductor is the leading chip foundry in the world, a position it obtained by staying neutral in the chip race while offering cutting-edge technology. Unlike some of the other chip foundry companies, TSMC isn't marketing its own product. This gives clients like Nvidia or Apple the confidence that Taiwan Semi isn't going to steal some of the proprietary chip designs and market them themselves..Taiwan Semiconductor also has leading technology. Its 3 nanometer chip node is the best available globally, although some other fabrication facilities also have this production ability. But it's not stopping there. By the end of 2025, TSMC's 2nm chips will be available, and its 1.6nm chips will be launched in late 2026. The focus on these chips isn't increased power; it's improved energy efficiency. When the 2nm chips are configured to run at the same speed as a 3nm chip, they consume 20% to 30% less power. And 1.6nm chips will improve the energy consumption level by 15% to 20% on top of that. With a large focus on how much energy data centers consume for AI training, these chips should prove popular..Although this is exciting technology, customers aren't waiting for next-generation chips to be launched; they're buying what's available now. This is evident at TSMC's Arizona production facility, which sold out chip production through 2027. This makes it obvious that TSMC management has an idea of what level of demand is brewing a few years out, and the commentary it's provided on this subject is incredibly bullish..Over the next five years, it expects AI-related revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 45%. Companywide, it expects this growth rate to approach a CAGR of 20%. That's an impressive level of growth for a company of TSMC's size, and it underscores the entire bull case for the company.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-090000049.html,Market Risk  Industry Risk  Company Specific Risk  Operational Risk  Regulatory Risk No Liquidity Risk  No Credit Risk

The world's biggest tech companies plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building out data centers this year alone. And from the way their leadership teams talked on their most recent earnings calls, most of them don't expect to slow that capital spending down anytime soon..Of course, not every company will come out ahead from their investments in AI. And even if a company looks poised for financial success, the stock still needs to offer good value for investors. If you have a small amount available to invest at the moment, like $250, finding a good stock to buy could be even harder..I've identified three AI stocks you can buy now with just $250 that can help you capitalize on the next phase of growth in the industry..Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest public cloud computing infrastructure provider in the world. That said, it was caught flatfooted when the AI trend kicked off. It has worked hard to catch up with its competitors by focusing on providing a diverse range of AI services and making a strategic investment in Anthropic, a leading developer of foundational AI models. Now, when it comes to everything from raw computing power to platforms to build new large language models on top of, Amazon Web Services can meet clients' needs..Amazon is also working on its own purpose-built AI accelerator chips for both training and inference. It has seen strong demand for its custom silicon, and says customers are seeing significantly better price performance for both training and inference with its chips compared to the leading GPUs on the market..Importantly, Amazon expects to lay out more than $100 billion this year in capital expenditures, mostly focused on AI data centers. It wouldn't be spending that much if it didn't see strong demand for computing power. Management reiterated during its most recent earnings call that it remains capacity-constrained, so as more of its new data centers come online later this year, revenue growth for Amazon Web Services (AWS) should accelerate.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-081000034.html,High market risk (speculation)

But as with any technology that comes along, investors will need to watch for companies that fail to live up to the hype..This is where following the stock picks of billionaire investors could prove very helpful.

The latest round of 13Fs revealed prominent billionaires still buying shares of two high-flying chip stocks in the first quarter..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the leading chip manufacturer in the world. It controls more than 60% of the global foundry market, as it makes chips for leading chip companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Growing demand for chips used for AI workloads in data centers has helped send the stock up 279% over the past five years, and its run may not be over..Three notable billionaires were buying shares in the first quarter. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management were adding to their firm's stakes. The company's strong first quarter amid uncertainty over the economy is pointing to tremendous momentum in the AI market..Demand for AI chips remained robust in the first quarter. Revenue and earnings grew 35% and 60% year over year, and TSMC is making significant investments in expanding capacity to support long-term demand..TSMC recently unveiled its A14 logic process technology, representing a step forward from its current 2-nanometer (N2) process. The A14 delivers a 15% increase in performance with a 30% power savings over the N2 and is scheduled to enter production in 2028..These billionaires are making a bet that TSMC is benefiting from sustainable demand in the AI market.

This is due to weakness in technology stocks on account of the tariff-fueled turmoil and other factors such as questions surrounding the viability of huge investments being made in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure..But a closer look at the recent action indicates the index has made a strong comeback. The Nasdaq has bounced 18% higher in the past month. This solid turnaround can be attributed to a string of robust quarterly reports from companies making the most of the proliferation of AI, as well as positive developments on the tariff front that indicate the trade war could be cooling off..That's why now would be a good time for investors to consider buying shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), two AI stocks that have surged impressively in the past month and seem well placed to deliver more upside amid the Nasdaq's recovery. Let's see why these two names have the potential to soar even higher..Popularly known as TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest semiconductor foundry. It manufactures chips for the leading fabless chipmakers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Qualcomm, and MediaTek, among others. Consumer electronics giants such as Sony and Apple also tap TSMC's fabrication facilities for manufacturing chips..This puts TSMC right in the middle of the AI boom. The Taiwan-based foundry giant manufactures chips that go into a variety of AI applications, ranging from data centers to smartphones to personal computers (PCs) to cars. Moreover, its status as the world's biggest semiconductor foundry with a market share of 67% -- miles ahead of the 11% share that second-placed Samsung has -- illustrates.TSMC has a very wide moat that should allow it to make the most of the growing demand for AI chips from multiple verticals..Not surprisingly, TSMC's growth has been breathtaking so far in 2025. Its revenue in the first quarter shot up 35% year over year to $25.5 billion, exceeding consensus estimates. The earnings growth was even better as an increase of 5 percentage points in its net profit margin led to a year-over-year jump of 54% in its bottom line to $2.12 per share.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-bounces-back-2-artificial-123000879.html,Investment Risk (Specifically Market Volatility and Individual Stock Risk)

During the company's fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended Feb. 28), Oracle generated $14.1 billion in revenue. Of this figure, 86% stemmed from cloud services..However, Oracle's cloud division can be bifurcated into two further subunits: software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS)..Regarding AI, investors should be paying close attention to Oracle's cloud infrastructure (IaaS) business. During the quarter, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) generated just $2.7 billion in revenue, but it grew 49% year over year, making it Oracle's fastest-growing business by a long shot..The chart below illustrates Wall Street's consensus revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for Oracle over the next few years..An important takeaway from the figures above is not only do analysts expect Oracle to continue growing, but revenue and earnings growth could accelerate. To me, this signals that Wall Street is bullish on Oracle's ability to continue riding AI tailwinds. Moreover, as cloud hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet continue to invest in data center infrastructure alongside the likes of other big tech companies such as Meta Platforms and Elon Musk's xAI, Oracle's cloud infrastructure business looks poised to benefit..As of this writing, Oracle trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8.2.

After leading the last bull market higher, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks seem to have regained their footing and could be ready to lead again..Let's look at three AI stocks ready for a bull run..Where AI infrastructure spending goes, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is sure to follow. It's both the biggest risk the company faces and its biggest opportunity..The stock pulled back after the Trump administration enacted some tougher export restrictions for AI chips going into China, but trade deals with Middle Eastern countries that included investments in AI infrastructure eased investor concerns. Sovereign AI, or government AI spending, could be the next big driver of spending on the technology..This would be on top of the strong spending already being seen from cloud computing companies and companies training foundation AI models, such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms..With an over 80% market share in the graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia is very well positioned to continue to benefit from ongoing AI infrastructure spending. Meanwhile, its CUDA software platform and its collection of AI-focused libraries and tools that help streamline development and optimize the performance of its chips give it a wide competitive moat in the space..The stock is still reasonably valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.6 price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), with numbers below 1 considered undervalued..Another company well-positioned to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The company makes components that are crucial parts of data center infrastructure..It also has carved out a sizable niche in helping customers develop custom AI chips known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). While GPUs are more readily available and offer more flexibility, custom AI chips can offer better performance for the specific task for which they were designed while reducing power consumption..There are considerable up-front costs involved in designing these custom chips, but they can help lower the overall cost of ownership over time for customers, given that they are more energy efficient.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-085200623.html,Market Risk Technological Risk Operational Risk

A 13F offers investors an under-the-hood look at which stocks Wall Street's top money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter. May 15 was the 13F filing deadline for first-quarter trading activity..While Warren Buffett tends to be the most-tracked asset manager, he's far from the only billionaire investor who's delivered outsized returns. For instance, investors tend to also keep close tabs on billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, who manages more than $3 billion in assets at Duquesne Family Office..Though Druckenmiller's investing strategy often involves long and short positions across various asset classes, it's his approach to investing in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that's raising eyebrows..In less than two years, Druckenmiller has overseen the disposition of Wall Street's two hottest AI stocks and has chosen to load up his fund in another industry giant..While dozens of companies have benefited from the evolution of AI, no two artificial intelligence stocks have been the face of the movement more than graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR). Since 2023 began, shares of Nvidia and Palantir have rocketed higher by 827% and 1,920%, respectively..The lure of Nvidia has been its near-monopoly like share of the GPUs currently deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. The company's Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell chips offer a clear compute advantage over rivals. In turn, this has led to superior pricing power for Nvidia..Meanwhile, Palantir's AI-driven software-as-a-service Gotham and Foundry platforms have shined. In particular, its government-focused Gotham platform has landed numerous multiyear contracts with the U.S. government and its immediate allies.

He played a key role in the famous bet against the British pound in 1992, a trade that reports described as having ""broken the Bank of England.”.He was the founder and longtime chairman of Duquesne Capital Management, which he ran from 1981 until closing it in 2010. Over its nearly three decades, the firm delivered an average annual return of 30%..After Druckenmiller closed Duquesne Capital to outside investors, he actively managed his wealth under a family office structure called Duquesne Family Office..Duquesne Family Office has delivered a consistently strong performance across time frames. The portfolio returned 8.91% over the past year, 106.06% over three years, and 129.61% over five years. Over the past decade, it posted a 275.65% return, according to data from Stockcircle..In January, Druckenmiller said President Donald Trump’s return had reignited market enthusiasm and bolstered business optimism. Stock prices, however, fell sharply following Trump’s tariff announcement..At the time he'd said in a CNBC interview that “the risks [from tariffs] are overblown relative to the rewards. ..."".More recently Druckenmiller spoke out against elevated tariffs, warning that such measures could trigger market instability and economic harm.

The good part is that this tech giant still has room for more upside and it could even attain a $5 trillion valuation in the next three years..Let's take a closer look at the catalysts that could propel Nvidia toward that valuation..The terrific demand for Nvidia's AI graphics cards has played a central role in bringing the company's market cap to where it is now. Specifically, Nvidia stock has shot up nearly eightfold since OpenAI's popular chatbot ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Nvidia provided the graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to train ChatGPT, and it has remained the dominant force in the AI chip market since then..The company reportedly commanded a whopping 92% of the data center GPU market last year. What's worth noting is that Nvidia is still the go-to supplier of AI GPUs for the top cloud computing companies and governments. The company's revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on April 27) is projected to jump by 65% from the year-ago period to $43 billion..Its nearest competitor in the AI GPU market, Advanced Micro Devices, witnessed year-over-year revenue growth of 36% in Q1 this year to $7.4 billion. Nvidia, therefore, is still maintaining stronger growth levels despite having a much larger revenue base, driven by its terrific market share in AI GPUs. The data center segment accounted for 88% of the company's top line last year, and it is going to play a central role in helping Nvidia reach a $5 trillion valuation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-170000764.html,High market risk  High volatility risk  High speculation risk  High potential reward risk

As the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, it generated stable growth, consistently bought back its own shares, and paid a dependable dividend..Unfortunately, its net income has declined for the past six consecutive years, it hasn't bought back any shares over the past four years, and it suspended its dividend at the end of 2024. Its stock price plummeted more than 60% over the past five years as the S&P 500 more than doubled. It was also removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last November..Intel's decline was mainly caused by the manufacturing issues at its own foundries, its market share losses to a resurgent Adanced Micro Devices, and its jarring strategic shifts under four different CEOs over the past seven years. But should value-seeking investors take a chance on Intel's stock as it languishes at its lowest levels in more than a decade?.Intel made several major mistakes over the past few decades. Instead of licensing Arm Holdings' technology to develop its own mobile chips, it desperately tried to sell its own Atom x86 chips for mobile devices. However, its Atom chips were less power-efficient, and it eventually lost the entire mobile market to Arm-based chipmakers like Qualcomm and MediaTek..Intel also stopped developing its own discrete GPUs in 1999 to focus on producing weaker integrated GPUs for its CPUs. By the time it returned to the discrete GPU market in 2022, the market was already firmly controlled by Nvidia..Nvidia's dominance of the discrete GPU market turned it into the world's top artificial intelligence (AI) stock since those chips can process complex AI tasks much more efficiently than stand-alone CPUs. By failing to spot that long-term opportunity, Intel surrendered the booming AI GPU market to Nvidia..Meanwhile, Intel's core x86 CPU business faced an existential crisis. Its chips became harder to manufacture as they became smaller and denser, and it struggled with severe delays and shortages during its grueling transition from 14nm to 10nm chips between 2015 to 2019. It was plagued by even more delays with its transition from 10nm chips to 7nm chips (rebranded as Intel 4 to avoid direct comparisons against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's nodes) in 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-buy-now-141500537.html,1.

Two of the latest members to join the club are Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), although they're not exactly new members..Both companies fell out of the $1 trillion valuation with the latest market dip, but have since regained entry to this group as of the time of writing. However, this is just the beginning for both stocks, as plenty of growth trends could push them even higher (maybe even into the $2 trillion range)..Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures many of the chips that go into advanced technological devices. Whether it's an iPhone or an Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPU, TSMC makes the chips that go into these devices..While it has the best chip technology currently available (3-nanometer chips), it's slated to launch 2nm chips later this year and 1.6nm chips in 2026. The smaller the chip node, the more transistors it can pack onto a chip, which leads to more powerful designs. This continuous improvement culture is why many companies have chosen to partner with Taiwan Semi, and it is generally an irreplaceable supplier to its clients..Taiwan Semiconductor is also expected to grow massively over the next few years. Management projects AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years and overall growth to increase at nearly a 20% CAGR. If those assumptions come true, TSMC will be a must-own stock over the next five years..This projection also isn't a wild guess; there are real numbers to back it up. Many of TSMC's clients place chip orders years in advance, so the company often has an idea of what production looks like years out. For example, TSMC has already sold out its chip production capacity at its Arizona facility through 2027. So, this growth projection isn't far-fetched and could lead to significant outperformance by the stock..Taiwan Semi trades for 21 times forward earnings, which is a market-average multiple, meaning investors don't have to overpay to buy shares of TSMC stock..Although Taiwan Semi just joined the $1 trillion club, it's well on its way to potentially becoming a $2 trillion club member in under five years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-unstoppable-ai-stocks-just-110000085.html,Market Risk

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) are the two stocks that meet this criteria.,"Meta Platforms is making huge investments in several real-world AI devices..Taiwan Semiconductor is behind many of today's cutting-edge technologies..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.It isn't easy to assess where a rapidly changing industry like artificial intelligence (AI) will be a decade from now. However, I think I've pinpointed two stocks at the forefront of the AI arms race that will be fine 10 years later..Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) are the two stocks that meet this criteria. Although they operate in vastly different areas of the AI investment sphere, each has what it takes to stand the test of time and be a phenomenal investment over the next decade..Meta Platforms is likely better known by its former name, Facebook. Most of Meta's revenue comes from social media sites it owns, specifically from advertisements on those platforms. In Q1, 98% of Meta's revenue came from ads, so it's clear that Meta is an ad business..Meta has implemented AI tools into its advertising toolkit, which helps advertisers craft better ads to cater to a specific viewer. These premium features lead to better ad performance, which allows Meta to increase the price of an ad, as they can guarantee a better outcome..Additionally, Meta is making huge investments in several real-world AI devices, such as its glasses. While these products are still a ways out, if they become a hit and a must-have item, a brand new revenue stream will open up for Meta. This isn't accounted for in its current valuation, and could lead to explosive stock performance if these items take off..Meta isn't going anywhere in the next 10 years, and it's setting itself up well with its AI investments. Meta is a strong pick to buy and hold for the next decade, as long as investors are patient through the various economic cycles, which will cause ad revenue to rise and fall..Taiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC) is the world's leading fabrication foundry, continuously innovating to provide cutting-edge chips. This is key to its maintaining its position atop the chipmaking world. Investing in Taiwan Semi is a smart way to play nearly any technological trend, as TSMC is most likely producing the chips behind the technology..For example, iPhones and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs utilize chips made by Taiwan Semi. Although these devices may be replaced by other products, the chips that go into these upstarts will still likely be sourced from Taiwan Semiconductor.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-113000758.html,1.

Such stocks tend to offer investors more safety, and this approach is especially beneficial when a stock has not approached the end of its high-growth years..Fortunately, the market offers numerous stocks that fit this description, and many of them have achieved their growth through success in artificial intelligence (AI)..With that, three analysts from The Motley Fool have recommended stocks that fit such a description. These large-cap stocks have not only stayed at the top of industries they helped transform but have also focused on plans that can keep them on a growth trajectory for years to come..Jake Lerch (Amazon): My choice is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When I think about which stocks have the potential to drive wealth over the long term, I look for companies with multiple pathways to success. In other words, diversification is key. Amazon, with its multiple business segments, is a perfect candidate..Obviously, the company is most well-known for its sprawling e-commerce empire, but there's far more to Amazon than just online sales. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit is the world's largest cloud services provider. That segment now generates over $100 billion in revenue annually and is poised to grow even larger as AI drives further data center spending by organizations around the globe..Moreover, Amazon also has a lucrative advertising business that generated over $56 billion in annual revenue in 2024. That's nothing to sneeze at, and it makes Amazon one of the largest players in the rapidly growing field of digital advertising..Finally, some areas currently generate comparatively little revenue but have big potential going forward. Here, I'm thinking about Amazon's robotics and AI businesses. The company already utilizes nearly 1 million robots supporting its warehouse and logistics operations. As the company scales up its use of robots, Amazon should realize increased profits as its margins expand..What's more, the company is surely learning lessons from its vast fleet of robots, which could make Amazon a leader in AI-powered robotics. In the future, Amazon could parlay this expertise into another lucrative business segment, serving organizations that lack their own fleet of AI robotics by loaning or selling robots trained to perform any variety of tasks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-stocks-destined-drive-120000272.html,1.

While price targets are always estimates, it's good to know your acceptable rate of return for an investment.","Management has a great view of what future growth looks like..Taiwan Semi is building more chip capacity in the U.S..The stock trades right at its five-year average valuation mark..10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›.The market is a forward-looking machine, so knowing where a stock is heading is key to investing success. While price targets are always estimates, it's good to know your acceptable rate of return for an investment. That way, you'll know if your stock-picking process is working..One stock that I'm extremely confident in is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). I'm confident that this stock will not only beat the market over the next five years, it will crush it. But where did I get my estimate of a 129% gain in five years? It's fairly obvious when you listen to management speak..Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry. Its clients are among the biggest tech companies in the world, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). When you hear about companies like these two designing their own chip, they are designing it, but the manufacturing process is most likely farmed out to TSMC. This is a great relationship, as big tech companies don't need to maintain expensive facilities and employ thousands of workers whose only expertise is chip production..In return, TSMC provides best-in-class technology and execution. Right now, TSMC can produce 3nm (nanometer) chips, which few other foundries can. It's also working toward 2nm chips slated to be launched later this year and 1.6nm chips for 2026. TSMC has cemented itself as a great partner by continuously innovating and offering cutting-edge technology..Because chip orders are often placed years in advance, TSMC's management has unparalleled insight into the company's future. So, when it speaks, investors should listen. Over the next five years, management expects AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), with overall revenue nearing a 20% CAGR. That's strong growth, but what does that mean for the stock?.At the end of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor produced $90.1 billion in revenue. If TSMC produced an 18% growth rate (near 20% as management has guided for), that figure would rise to $206 billion -- a 129% rise. That's well over a double in under five years. As long as TSMC can maintain its margins and isn't valued at an absurd starting valuation, assuming that its stock price will increase by a similar amount is not unreasonable.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-taiwan-semiconductor-stock-could-104500832.html,"Economic Risk, Industry Risk, Market Risk"
196,2025-05-17 17:45:00,3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist,Data center growth is expected to push Nvidia's stock higher.  Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the next five years will be incredible.  Investors are worried Alphabet's business will look far different in the next few years.,"Data center growth is expected to push Nvidia's stock higher..Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the next five years will be incredible..Investors are worried Alphabet's business will look far different in the next few years..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Although the market had a strong week, plenty of stocks still look like phenomenal buys. I'm focusing on three right now: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)..Although each of these stocks may have rallied over the past week, their gains will be nothing compared to the long-term stock performance that's in store for this trio..Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed in applications that require significant computing power, such as artificial intelligence (AI) model training. Nvidia's market share in the data center GPU market is astonishing, with most estimates pegging Nvidia's market share above 90%..Additionally, over the past 12 months, Nvidia has generated $115 billion in sales from its data center division. Considering that Nvidia's overall revenue over the past 12 months was $130.5 billion, Nvidia's performance is heavily tied to data center buildouts..While some investors are worried that data center buildouts may slow, all big tech companies have committed to record-setting capital expenditures in 2025, most of which will be deployed in data center builds..A third-party estimate Nvidia cited stated that data center buildouts totaled $400 billion in 2024. However, that figure is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. That's incredible growth, and if it turns out to be true, there's still massive upside for Nvidia's stock if it maintains its market share dominance..This is still the early innings of AI deployment and workload migration to the cloud. As a result, there's still a ton of data center capacity to build, which is excellent news for Nvidia. With that in mind, Nvidia is a stock that I want to buy and hold for years to come..Taiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC) makes chips for Nvidia and nearly every other big tech company. These clients can't manufacture their own semiconductors, so they farm out that work to foundries like TSMC. Nobody has the long-term history of continuous innovation and execution like this company, so it has cemented its place as a valuable partner for these companies for the foreseeable future..Management is incredibly bullish on the future. They expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall company revenue increasing at nearly a 20% CAGR. Many companies place chip orders years in advance, so when TSMC's management speaks about future growth, investors would be wise to listen.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-stocks-buy-094500196.html,- High Risk: Alphabet's business change - Medium Risk: Taiwan Semiconductor's growth dependency - Low Risk: Nvidia's data center growth  - No Risk: Overall (stocks to buy)
197,2025-05-17 02:39:00,Intel's new chip manufacturing technology is its greatest hope for a turnaround — and its biggest risk,Intel's 18A process is coming later this year. It's the company's biggest chance to catch back up with rival TSMC. But it's a risky bet.,"Intel's (INTC) efforts to restore the chip giant to its former glory may hinge on a new manufacturing process the company calls 18A..Short for 18 angstroms — an angstrom is equal to 0.1 nanometers — 18A is, according to Wall Street analysts and chip industry experts, Intel's last hope to take back the semiconductor crown from rival TSMC (TSM)..Available later this year, 18A takes advantage of two manufacturing techniques that TSMC isn't using yet: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. Intel says the technologies will improve its chips' performance and efficiency..But Intel isn't just using 18A to reclaim its place as a leading chipmaker. The company is also banking on using the technology to move in on TSMC's contract manufacturing business by building 18A-based chips for itself and custom versions for third-party customers..But that'll prove difficult. TSMC already builds chips for companies including AMD, Apple, and Nvidia. Intel opened up its manufacturing business to outside clients in 2021 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger. But Wall Street analysts and executives grew exasperated with his strategy and what they saw as unrealistic goals for the business, which lost $13.4 billion in 2024 despite recording a revenue of $17.5 billion..So far, Amazon and Microsoft have signed on to build their own chips using Intel's 18A process, with the hope that others will follow suit. But CFO David Zinsner says third-party commitments are ""not significant"" yet, according to Reuters..Intel's 18A is so important because it's introducing two technologies to the company's chips at once. First, it's taking advantage of gate-all-around transistors — next-generation transistors that can more actively control the flow of electricity through a chip. It's also using a technique called backside power, which changes where and how power is delivered to a chip's transistors to enable more efficiency and better performance..Together, the two technologies would help improve AI application performance without running into energy constraints, UC Santa Barbara engineering professor Kaustav Banerjee told Yahoo Finance. That would cut down on problems like overheating — something that reportedly plagued Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) when they were in development..Taking first-mover advantage in the chip industry typically means big wins for a semiconductor manufacturer. Intel's founders invented modern semiconductors, and the chipmaker was the first to successfully manufacture a new kind of transistor called Finfet in 2011.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-new-chip-manufacturing-technology-is-its-greatest-hope-for-a-turnaround--and-its-biggest-risk-183912933.html,- Technological Risk - Business Risk - Competitive Risk
198,2025-05-16 21:00:00,Investors Heavily Search Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM): Here is What You Need to Know,"TSMC (TSM) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","TSMC (TSM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +28%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 23.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..TSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.5%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.19 points to a change of +30.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.55 indicates a change of +14.8% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TSMC is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-taiwan-semiconductor-130015229.html,Market Risk
