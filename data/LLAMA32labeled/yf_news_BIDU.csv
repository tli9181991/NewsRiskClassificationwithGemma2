The latest iterations, ERNIE 4.5 and X1 Turbo, demonstrate remarkable progress in both reasoning and multimodal capabilities. Yet the key question remains: Is ERNIE alone enough to anchor Baidu’s broader AI strategy?There is no denying the model’s technical strength. ERNIE now powers a growing share of Baidu’s product ecosystem, including Gen AI-enhanced search, intelligent digital humans and its Qianfan model-as-a-service platform. These efforts are already translating into commercial success, AI Cloud revenues surged 42% year over year in first-quarter 2025, now accounting for 26% of Baidu Core revenues.However, Baidu’s AI strategy is clearly broader than just the ERNIE model itself. The company’s strength lies in its end-to-end AI stack, combining infrastructure, models, applications and tools. Importantly, it is adopting an application-driven approach, optimizing model development around real-world use cases, not academic benchmarks.Open-sourcing ERNIE 4.5 later this year indicates Baidu’s confidence, but also a strategic hedge. In a fiercely competitive AI landscape, where rivals offer chatbots and foundation models of their own, openness and flexibility can drive developer adoption.So, while ERNIE is the engine, it is Baidu’s integrated AI ecosystem, Qianfan, agents, digital humans and Apollo Go, that fuels the real ambition. On its own, ERNIE may not be enough. But as part of Baidu’s full-stack AI playbook, this could be more than enough to keep it at the forefront of China’s AI race..Baidu’s ERNIE may be at the forefront of China’s AI-foundation model race, but Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA and Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY are formidable challengers building out their own AI ecosystems.Alibaba, through the Cloud Intelligence Group, has been pushing hard with its Tongyi Qianwen model series. Integrated deeply into enterprise SaaS, cloud services and consumer-facing platforms like DingTalk, Alibaba’s model strategy emphasizes versatility and ecosystem embedding. The company’s enterprise scale and cloud dominance give it distribution power that Baidu must match through Qianfan and strategic partnerships.Tencent, meanwhile, is leveraging its massive user base and gaming, social and content platforms to deploy Hunyuan, its own large model. The company focuses more on AI-as-a-service and verticalized applications across entertainment, finance and healthcare. While Baidu leads in full-stack AI infrastructure, Tencent’s reach and monetization pathways pose a real challenge.To stay ahead, Baidu must keep differentiating ERNIE with cost-efficient performance, rapid iteration and real-world applications at scale.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidus-ai-push-gains-momentum-150300279.html,Market Risk Financial Risk Operational Risk

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Baidu Inc. (BIDU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this web search company have returned +4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Baidu Inc. falls in, has gained 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Baidu Inc. is expected to post earnings of $2.41 per share, indicating a change of -16.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.61 points to a change of -8.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.1 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Baidu Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Baidu Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-bidu-trending-stock-130005580.html,Market Sentiment Risk.

4,2025-06-23 22:45:00,Baidu vs. Alphabet: Which AI Powerhouse Stock Deserves Your Cash?,Can BIDU compete with GOOGL's AI edge and financial muscle despite its setbacks?,"Baidu BIDU and Alphabet GOOGL share roots in Internet search and have evolved into global AI heavyweights, each riding the wave of generative AI and cloud services. Baidu, China’s dominant search engine, has leveraged its platform to develop and deploy advanced AI models—like ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1—as well as autonomous driving technology through its Apollo initiative. Alphabet, Google’s parent, spans search, advertising, Cloud, YouTube, and hardware, and is spearheading AI progress with Gemini 2.5, AI-powered Cloud services, and TPUs such as Ironwood.The recent surge of interest in generative AI and language models has put companies like Baidu and Alphabet in the spotlight. Google’s rollout of AI features (like its Bard/Gemini AI for search) and Baidu’s launch of its ERNIE Bot (an answer to ChatGPT) underscore how both are racing to monetize AI innovations. Investors are wondering which company is better positioned today for upside. Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu is the unrivaled search leader in China, controlling roughly 60% of China’s search engine market. This core search dominance provides a massive user base and ad platform akin to Google’s in its home market. Beyond search advertising, Baidu has aggressively invested in next-generation tech: its Apollo autonomous driving unit and Apollo Go ride-hailing service are growing (Apollo Go saw a 75% year-over-year increase in rides in first-quarter 2025), and Baidu’s AI Cloud division is booming with 42% revenue growth in the last reported quarter. AI Cloud's non-GAAP operating margin now sits at the level of teens, aided by improved revenue mix and scale efficiencies. The company’s focus on full-stack AI infrastructure and rapid model iteration—most notably the release of ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo—has significantly reduced inference costs while enhancing performance. These improvements make Baidu’s AI Cloud offerings highly cost-competitive, especially as enterprise clients increasingly look to deploy Gen AI applications at scale.Baidu faces several key challenges as it pivots aggressively toward AI. Its online marketing revenue declined 6% year over year, reflecting weakness in its traditional ad business amid a transition to AI-powered search that is not yet fully monetized. While AI-generated content now powers 35% of mobile search results, monetization remains in early testing, putting pressure on near-term revenue and margins. Additionally, Baidu reported negative free cash flow of RMB9.2 billion (excluding iQIYI), driven by rising investments in AI infrastructure, cloud services, and autonomous driving. The company also faces intensifying competition from rivals like Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY in the AI cloud space, while U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chips could disrupt its infrastructure scale-up. Although Baidu touts flexibility in chip sourcing and strong GPU utilization, these constraints could still impact efficiency. Moreover, the wide scope of its AI initiatives, from foundation models to digital humans and robotaxis, raises execution risks and may strain resources in the near term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-alphabet-ai-powerhouse-134500273.html,Market Risk  Competitive Risk  Financial Risk  Company Specific Risk
5,2025-06-23 21:30:00,Baidu Inc. (BIDU) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,"According to the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), one should invest in Baidu Inc. (BIDU). It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Baidu Inc. (BIDU)..Baidu Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy..Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Baidu Inc. here>>>.The ABR suggests buying Baidu Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

That’s come as they shift to focus on monetization of their loyal user bases while beefing up their podcast and live event offerings..Tencent Music has notched four-straight quarters of growth in revenue per paying user by successfully driving subscribers to more expensive plans. That’s a refreshing break from the frequent headlines on deep price cuts for EVs and e-commerce that has sparked volatility in China tech stocks in recent years..“Music is becoming more important to the lives of young people in China, and you’re not going to just save one or two yuan to abandon all your playlists and jump to another platform,” said Ivan Su, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. “The monthly subscription price — which costs about the same as a cup of coffee — is very low.”.The Chinese online music industry has consolidated over the past few years, leaving the units of Tencent Holdings Ltd. and NetEase Inc. in a virtual duopoly. Spotify is blocked by a firewall in China..Tencent Music is the leader with about 555 million monthly active users as of the end of March, some 22% of which were paid subscribers. That compares with a paid penetration rate of around 40% for Spotify..One of the key planks of Tencent Music’s monetization strategy is its Super Premium VIP tier, where users pay roughly $4 per month for exclusive content plus early access to special artist merchandise and live events. Subscribers pay about $2 for a basic monthly subscription..The percentage of premium members relative to all paying users could rise to 19% in 2027 from 12% this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Lincoln Kong wrote in a note this week. The bank added they expect 10% growth in average revenue per paid user this year and high-single digits for 2026 onward..Like Spotify, Tencent Music is also making moves into other services.

Yesterday, CEO Elon Musk reposted a video on X showing a driverless Tesla navigating the streets of Austin, TX, sparking fresh excitement among investors. The video featured a Model Y making turns without a human driver, hinting that Tesla's robotaxi ambitions may be finally coming to life..When asked about the launch date, Musk replied that Tesla plans to start public rides with its robotaxis on June 22. This would mark the first time Tesla offers fully self-driving rides to customers. Musk added that the first trip from the Tesla factory to a customer's house is scheduled for his birthday on June 28. However, he also cautioned that safety remains the top priority, and the timeline could still shift if needed..The initial rollout won't be massive — at least not yet. Tesla plans to start small, with about 10-20 Model Y SUVs giving rides around Austin. For now, there will still be remote human supervision to make sure everything runs smoothly. If everything goes well, Tesla would expand to other states like California, though tougher regulations there might slow things down..Tesla's been busy testing these cars on Austin's streets, using its latest Full Self-Driving software. The video Musk shared showed a Model Y, clearly labeled ""Robotaxi,"" smoothly navigating an intersection on its own with no driver in sight..Musk has bet heavily on self-driving technology as the future of Tesla. The company sees robotaxis as a potential game-changing revenue stream, especially as competition heats up in the core EV market. If Tesla can successfully pull this off, it could be a huge breakthrough for both the company and the broader autonomous driving industry. But as always with Tesla, investors may want to keep expectations in check. Challenges around safety, regulation and the complexity of full autonomy still loom large..While Tesla is just about to enter the robotaxi market, some competitors like Alphabet and Baidu are already far ahead.

While macro pressures and regulatory uncertainty still weigh on China’s tech landscape, Baidu’s cloud transformation signals a notable shift in the company’s core business dynamics. AI Cloud revenue jumped 42% year over year to RMB6.7 billion, now contributing 26% of Baidu Core revenue, up from 20% a year earlier. This growth is fueled by rising enterprise demand for generative AI capabilities and foundation models, delivered primarily through Qianfan, Baidu’s Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform.The company’s emphasis on full-stack AI infrastructure and continual model optimization, evidenced by the recent launches of ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo, has significantly cut inference costs while improving output quality. These improvements are making Baidu’s AI Cloud more attractive to clients seeking scalable and cost-efficient AI deployments.Importantly, Baidu has shifted its cloud revenue mix toward subscription-based models, offering greater visibility and sustainability. Management emphasized that subscription revenues now make up the majority of enterprise cloud sales, with Gen AI-related subscription revenue growing at triple-digit rates for multiple quarters.Profitability is also on an upswing, with non-GAAP operating margins for AI Cloud reaching the mid-teens. However, Baidu continues to reinvest aggressively in AI infrastructure and emerging applications, such as autonomous driving and Gen AI search, which may cap near-term margin expansion.Overall, Baidu’s execution in cloud AI is gaining momentum, signaling that its multi-year bet on AI is not only paying off but also reshaping the company’s long-term growth narrative..As Baidu doubles down on AI Cloud, it faces formidable competition from Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY, both are aggressively expanding their cloud footprints in China’s evolving AI landscape. Alibaba Cloud, still the market leader by share, is integrating its proprietary Tongyi Qianwen foundation models into a broad range of enterprise services. With a massive installed base and strong ties across e-commerce and logistics, Alibaba offers both scale and cross-sector penetration that Baidu must contend with.Meanwhile, Tencent is leveraging its strengths in gaming, social platforms, and fintech to embed AI services into vertical applications. Tencent’s Hunyuan model is gaining traction, and the company’s approach emphasizes AI-as-a-service across its super app ecosystem.Where Baidu sets itself apart is through its deep stack integration, from chips to models to applications, via Qianfan.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-bets-big-ai-cloud-160800780.html,Market Risk: High Operational Risk: Medium Compliance Risk: Low Reputation Risk: Low Credit Risk: Low Liquidity Risk: Low Regulatory Risk: Low

And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Baidu Inc. is expected to post earnings of $2.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.9%..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.5%. This estimate has changed -3.3% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.7 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Baidu Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.6%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Baidu Inc..",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-bidu-attracting-investor-130004939.html,Market Sensitivity Risk

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Baidu, Inc. BIDU, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY..Here is a synopsis of all five stocks..European Wax Center is a leading personal care and waxing services brand with a broad network of franchised locations across the US. While the company has struggled since going public in 2021, shedding more than 70% of its value in the years following its IPO, recent performance suggests a major turnaround is underway..After years of underperformance, EWCZ is now generating consistent profits, benefiting from improving margins and operational efficiency. More importantly, the stock has caught the attention of Wall Street, with both earnings estimates and share price momentum shifting sharply in its favor..The stock has surged 63% over the past month alone, yet still trades at a bargain valuation, suggesting that this may just be the beginning of a longer-term recovery. With analyst sentiment improving and the business fundamentals strengthening, European Wax Center appears to be a high-upside opportunity..European Wax Center has seen a sharp turnaround in sentiment, driven by a wave of upward earnings estimate revisions. Over the past month, analysts have significantly raised their projections, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current year earnings estimates have nearly doubled, up 97% in the last month, while forecasts for next year have jumped by 65%..Earnings are expected to grow at an impressive 18.4% annually over the next three to five years, suggesting strong long-term potential. Despite this growth, the stock remains remarkably inexpensive, trading at just 8.6x forward earnings. With a PEG ratio of only 0.46, the valuation leaves ample room for multiple expansion, while also helping to cushion downside risk..Operationally, EWCZ has been consistently outperforming expectations. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 187%. That trend looks set to continue, with the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) currently forecasting a 6.32% beat for the upcoming quarterly report. With both momentum and valuation on its side, European Wax Center is quickly shaping as a compelling opportunity..After a prolonged downtrend that lasted more than three years, European Wax Center appears to have finally found its footing. The stock has carved out a clear bottoming pattern and is now showing strong signs of a sustained reversal. Following a period of consolidation in the second half of May, shares broke out decisively in early June, confirming the trend change with a renewed surge in buying interest.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-wax-center-1-800-090000469.html,* Market Risk * Credit Risk * Liquidity Risk

BIDU is currently trading at a discount relative to its industry and historical metrics, with its forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting below its five-year average, as shown below. It currently has a Value Score of B.This is a deep discount to the broader tech sector and even to Chinese peers. By comparison, Alibaba BABA has a forward P/E of 10.96 and Tencent TCEHY has 16. Meanwhile, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector is currently trading at 26.22X..Baidu Valuation.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.In terms of Baidu’s share price performance, its shares have gained only 1.8% so far this year. Meanwhile, its peers Alibaba and Tencent have surged 40.8% and 24.2%, respectively, during the same time frame. The Zacks Internet – Services industry has lost 6.3%, and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector has gained 1.3% year to date..Share Price Performance.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Let’s analyze BIDU’s current strengths and risks to determine if the stock warrants an investment at this stage..Baidu’s most immediate opportunity lies in the continued rapid scaling of its AI Cloud business. In the first quarter of 2025, AI Cloud revenue surged 42% from a year ago to RMB 6.7 billion, accelerating from 26% growth in fourth-quarter 2024. This segment now makes up 26% of Baidu Core revenue, up from 20% a year ago—a clear sign that AI Cloud is becoming a central growth driver. Triple-digit growth in generative AI and foundation model-related revenue within Cloud further suggests strong demand tailwinds. As China’s enterprise AI adoption deepens, Baidu’s Qianfan MaaS platform—with its broad model library, industry-leading inference cost efficiency, and support for multimodal and reasoning models—positions the company to consolidate its share in this expanding market.Another major opportunity is Baidu’s autonomous driving business. Apollo Go provided approximately 1.4 million rides in first-quarter 2025, up 75% year over year, and management confirmed that the service is now fully driverless in mainland China and entering new global markets such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Hong Kong. The fleet of more than 1,000 driverless vehicles and the unique, sub-$30,000 unit cost of the RT6 purpose-built robotaxi give Baidu an edge in scaling autonomous mobility. New partnerships, such as with CAR Inc., could further support asset-light, scalable growth. Baidu’s AI-powered search transformation also represents a significant long-term opportunity. As of April 2025, about 35% of mobile search results contained AI-generated content, up sharply from 22% in January. Management expects this penetration to keep rising in the second quarter. While monetization is in early testing, the ability to monetize long-tail queries and new formats could eventually expand Baidu’s ad revenue base beyond the limits of traditional search.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-trading-discount-8-59x-155300026.html,1.

The shakeout may just be getting started..Most Read from Bloomberg.Next Stop: Rancho Cucamonga!.Where Public Transit Systems Are Bouncing Back Around the World.Trump Said He Fired the National Portrait Gallery Director. She’s Still There..ICE Moves to DNA-Test Families Targeted for Deportation with New Contract.US Housing Agency Vulnerable to Fraud After DOGE Cuts, Documents Warn.For all the Chinese government’s efforts to prevent price cuts by market leader BYD Co. from turning into a vicious spiral, analysts say a combination of weaker demand and extreme overcapacity will slice into profits at the strongest brands and force feebler competitors to fold. Even after the number of EV makers started shrinking for the first time last year, the industry is still using less than half its production capacity..Chinese authorities are trying to minimize the fallout, chiding the sector for “rat race competition” and summoning heads of major brands to Beijing last week. Yet previous attempts to intervene have had little success. For the short term at least, investors are betting few automakers will escape unscathed: BYD, arguably the biggest winner from industry consolidation, has lost $21.5 billion in market value since its shares peaked in late May..“What you’re seeing in China is disturbing, because there’s a lack of demand and extreme price cutting,” said John Murphy, a senior automotive analyst at Bank of America Corp. Eventually there will be “massive consolidation” to soak up the excess capacity, Murphy said..For automakers, relentless discounting erodes profit margins, undermines brand value and forces even well-capitalized companies into unsustainable financial positions. Low-priced and low-quality products can seriously damage the international reputation of “Made-in-China” cars, noted the People’s Daily, an outlet controlled by the Communist Party. And that knock would come just as models from BYD to Geely, Zeekr and Xpeng start to collect accolades on the world stage..For consumers, price drops may seem beneficial but they mask deeper risks. Unpredictable pricing discourages long-term trust — already people are complaining on China’s social media, wondering why they should buy a car now when it may be cheaper next week — while there’s a chance automakers, as they cut costs to stay afloat, may reduce investment in quality, safety and after-sales service.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/byd-unleashes-ev-industry-reckoning-210000104.html,- Market Risk - Industry Risk - Regulatory Risk - Systemic Risk - Economic Risk

However, GOOGL seems to have been losing some of its mojo in the search market due to growing usage of Generative AI applications, including Perplexity and Microsoft-backed Open AI’s ChatGPT, as well as stiff competition from traditional search engines, including Bing, Yandex, Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo and Baidu BIDU.According to the latest data from StatCounter, Google had a market share of 89.54% in May 2025. In comparison, Bing and Baidu had market shares of 4% and 0.69%, respectively. Per Statista data, Google had a market share of 89.62% as of March 2025, the lowest over the past two decades.However, Alphabet has been taking up initiatives to improve market share in Search through AI innovations. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview’s advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities. AI Overviews is driving a more than 10% increase in usage of Google for queries that support AI Overviews in Google’s biggest markets, like India and the United States. AI Overview is currently used by more than 1.5 billion people monthly. AI mode is now available in the United States. Circle to Search has been another key catalyst driving user engagement. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Circle to Search was available on 250 million devices, with usage increasing roughly 40% during the quarter. Per our model, Google Search & other revenues are expected to see a CAGR of 11% between 2024 and 2027..Microsoft is keeping no stone unturned to improve the capabilities of Bing. MSFT has been integrating AI into Bing thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The company introduced Copilot Search in Bing in April this year and launched Bing Video Creator on Monday. Bing Video Creator is powered by OpenAI’s Sora, which allows users’ text prompts to be converted into short videos.Meanwhile, Baidu is leveraging self-developed ERNIE models to boost the potency of its Search engine. In March 2025, Baidu released ERNIE 4.5, which features multimodal capabilities and ERNIE X1, its first reasoning model. In April, Baidu launched ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo, which deliver improved performance at a much lower cost..Alphabet shares have dropped 11.2% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 0.1% and the Zacks Internet Services industry’s decline of 9.1%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabets-ai-innovation-help-google-140800602.html,Market Share Risk Competitive Risk Technological Risk Reputation Risk

The overly optimistic recommendations of Wall Street analysts make the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric questionable. So, is it worth buying the stock?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Baidu Inc. (BIDU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Baidu Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy..Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Baidu Inc. here>>>The ABR suggests buying Baidu Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

That is because the Jun 20, 2025 $50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today..Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy..Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Baidu shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Baidu is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Internet - Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.64 per share to $2.41 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Baidu right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected..Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

It triggered a reconsideration of heavy investments in acquiring AI computational resources and a flurry of new model introductions from Chinese players from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Zhipu AI..“The fast pace of model releases and updates since the release of DeepSeek R1 has resulted in some ‘model fatigue’ among investors,” said Gary Tan, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “Until there is a breakthrough in the model, investors are turning their focus on which internet companies can integrate AI into their operations and create a killer application.”.The debut of R1 turned DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng into a tech celebrity and a symbol of China’s ability to compete with the best of Silicon Valley. In February, President Xi Jinping invited Liang to a high-profile gathering with some of the country’s most prominent entrepreneurs.

29,2025-05-28 00:45:00,Baidu vs. Alibaba: Which Chinese AI Stock Is the Better Investment Now?,Should you bet on BIDU's autonomous driving or BABA's AI-powered cloud? Find out which stock stands tall.,"Baidu BIDU and Alibaba BABA are two of China’s tech titans that have increasingly pivoted toward artificial intelligence (AI). Both companies dominate their respective fields – Baidu in online search and AI cloud services, Alibaba in e-commerce and cloud computing – yet they share notable similarities. Each is profitable, generates substantial cash, and has been pouring investments into cutting-edge AI research and applications.In fact, Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Baidu have recently captured renewed investor attention thanks to a series of positive developments (including massive government stimulus and the rise of AI services) after a few challenging years. With China’s AI sector booming, these two companies stand out as key players riding the trend.Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu, often dubbed “China’s Google,” has successfully repositioned itself as an AI-first company, marking a significant shift toward cloud computing and AI services in recent years. The company’s aggressive push into AI has yielded promising results, particularly in its first-quarter 2025 performance. Baidu Core’s revenue growth was driven largely by its AI Cloud business, which surged 42% year over year. AI Cloud now represents 26% of Baidu Core’s revenue, up from 20% in the same period the previous year, highlighting increasing recognition of Baidu's AI capabilities.A key driver behind Baidu’s AI growth is its model-as-a-service platform, Qianfan, which offers an extensive model library and supports fine-tuning of multimodal and reasoning models. By reducing inference costs, Qianfan has made Baidu’s cloud offerings especially attractive to enterprise clients, bolstering subscription-based revenue. (read more: Baidu's Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Margins Down Y/Y).Baidu further strengthened its AI leadership with the launch of ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1, and their Turbo versions in April 2025. These models promise superior performance at lower costs, enabled by Baidu’s unique four-layer AI architecture that optimizes infrastructure, frameworks, models, and applications. As part of its strategy to drive accessibility, Baidu plans to open-source ERNIE 4.5 by June 30, 2025, helping expand its ecosystem.Despite challenges such as U.S. chip export restrictions, Baidu remains confident in its ability to maintain momentum, citing efficient GPU utilization and growing domestic chip capabilities. Additionally, Baidu’s mobile search product is increasingly AI-driven, with 35% of mobile search results now featuring AI-generated content, up from 22% in January.In terms of challenges, the company posted a negative free cash flow of RMB 8.9 billion in the first quarter, largely due to elevated AI investments despite a strong operating margin of 16% for Baidu Core and a non-GAAP margin of 19%. Management signaled further increases in capital outlays for AI Cloud, model development, autonomous driving, and AI search transformation in 2025.The ongoing weakness in online advertising is a concern. Even in the latest quarter, Baidu’s core online marketing revenues declined 6% year over year, extending the prior year’s decline. Competition from rivals (e.g., ByteDance’s TikTok/Douyin in advertising, Tencent in digital ads, etc.) and the shift of ad budgets to new platforms have made it harder for Baidu to grow its search ad business. In cloud computing and AI, Baidu faces competition from Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Holdings Limited’s TCEHY cloud services.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-alibaba-chinese-ai-164500676.html,Market Risk  Operational Risk  Regulatory Risk

The founder and CEO of Ark Invest and stock picker for its growth-geared exchange-traded funds always keeps busy. She announces her trades at the end of every market day. And she bought a couple of stocks on Thursday..Ark added to its existing positions in Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) and Nextdoor (NYSE: KIND) on Thursday. It's a contrarian move on both fronts, as the stocks are down 20% to 42% over the past year. Let's take a closer look at Wood's latest purchases..China's leading search engine is still searching for a growth engine. Shares of Baidu have declined 6% in the two trading days since the company posted fresh financials on Wednesday morning. Revenue rose 3% to the U.S. equivalent of nearly $4.5 billion. It may not seem like much, but it's actually Baidu's strongest top-line showing in more than a year. .Baidu isn't the rock star it was when it went public 20 years ago as an ascending giant in search and online advertising in China. Annual revenue has clocked in with double-digit growth just once in the last six years. Half of those years have treated shareholders to top-line declines. .The quarter only gets worse if you work your way down the income statement. Adjusted earnings declined 8% to $891 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) slipped 6% to $925 million. On the bright side, the bottom line was comfortably ahead of Wall Street expectations for the first quarter. .Baidu's stock chart reflects its failure to launch as a growth stock in recent years. The shares are trading 20% lower over the past year, off by nearly a third over the past three years. Wood seems to think that now is a good time to add to her stake following this week's post-earnings pullback. I would have to agree. .Baidu is sheltered to a certain extent from the trade war fallout, as it generates the lion's share of its revenue in China. There are also some promising pockets of growth in its business. The unimpressive 3% overall increase in revenue was held back by a 9% decline for its iQIYI streaming video platform. Back that out, and core Baidu revenue rose a more encouraging 7%.

While market indices like the Nasdaq Composite gained modestly, Baidu's financial growth and innovative announcements lend significant support to its upward movement..Buy, Hold or Sell Baidu? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide..Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value..The recent announcement regarding Baidu's robust Q1 2025 financial performance and innovative AI product launches has implications for future revenue and earnings forecasts. The reported increase in net income and revenue sets a positive tone, suggesting potential for augmented revenue growth driven by their AI cloud advancements and the expansion of ERNIE and Apollo Go. However, analysts have projected a moderate annual revenue growth rate of 4.8% and anticipate a slight decline in profit margins over the next three years. These projections present a cautiously optimistic view of Baidu's future earnings trajectory in light of its current developments..Despite the recent surge in Baidu's share price by 8% following the news, the company's total returns over the last year show a 15.03% decline, highlighting a challenging period for the stock. Relative to its industry, Baidu underperformed over the past year compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry's 6.6% return, as well as the broader US market, which returned 11.1%. This longer-term performance underscores the volatility and competitive pressures Baidu faces in optimizing its core marketing and AI business lines..In terms of price movement, Baidu's current share price of US$91.23 is trading at a significant discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$110.95, suggesting an upside potential of 17.8%. This discrepancy indicates that while the market may require further justification for this optimistic outlook, the recent financial results and progressive AI initiatives could provide catalysts for future price recovery and alignment with the analyst target. Investors might consider monitoring both the execution of Baidu's strategic initiatives and broader market conditions as they assess future investment opportunities.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-nasdaqgs-bidu-reports-revenue-174522511.html,Operational Risk (Positive)  Market Risk (Positive)

42,2025-05-21 21:58:00,Baidu's AI cloud soars — but the risks are stacking up,"China’s biggest AI player, Baidu (BIDU), beat expectations with a surge in cloud revenue, but its ad business is shrinking, it’s slashing AI prices to stay ahead of local rivals, and fresh U.S. chip export issues could cut its momentum short.","China’s biggest AI player, Baidu (BIDU), beat expectations with a surge in cloud revenue, but its ad business is shrinking, it’s slashing AI prices to stay ahead of local rivals, and fresh U.S. chip export issues could cut its momentum short..In Q1 earnings posted Wednesday, Baidu reported that its AI Cloud revenue jumped 42% year-over-year, and in tandem, net income soared 42% to $951 million. However, the beat was padded by nearly $618 million in investment revaluation gains, not just operational lift. But even as the company leaned hard into enterprise AI, its core ad business fell 6% vs. last year..That decline in online advertising revenue during Q1 2025 looks to be primarily attributed to macro factors, including slowing consumer spending in China. Observers following search volumes on both sides of the Pacific may wonder if Baidu’s results recall Alphabet’s recent panic when an Apple (AAPL) exec testified regarding reduced search volumes..While there’s no direct evidence linking this decline to AI reducing search volumes, it’s plausible that the integration of AI technologies, like Baidu’s Ernie chatbots, could be altering user behavior. Such a shift could impact ad impressions and click-through rates, with knock-on effects for advertising revenue. However, Baidu has not explicitly stated that AI is the cause of the advertising revenue decline..Speaking of Ernie, Baidu also finds itself in an arms race at home — and racing to undercut. Last month, the tech giant slashed prices on its Ernie 4.5 Turbo model by 80%, and cut pricing on its X1 Turbo model by half, in a bid to stay ahead of domestic competitors like Alibaba (BABA), DeepSeek, ByteDance, and Moonshot AI. Founder Robin Li told developers the company’s focus is on “removing friction,” that is, letting builders create without worrying about model cost or capabilities..It’s a slightly different kind of AI boom than the one playing out in the U.S., where Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure grew 33%, Google Cloud 28%, and AWS 17%, with strong monetization and margin performance. Baidu is growing faster, arguably, but it appears to be doing so by sacrificing pricing power and eating capex, corporate moves that can quickly turn into a race to the bottom. It’s not that American companies aren’t also wary of capex and overall spending, however, with Microsoft recent layoff’s suggested ongoing scrutiny of its costs..Complicating matters for Baidu: The U.S. Commerce Department’s recent guidance warning against Huawei’s Ascend AI chips has reignited geopolitical risk, if it ever died down at all. Chinese officials called the move “unilateral bullying,” and Baidu — reliant on domestic chip supply — is caught in the crossfire.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidus-ai-cloud-soars-risks-135832592.html,1.

44,2025-05-21 21:30:00,Is Baidu Inc. (BIDU) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,"Based on the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), Baidu Inc. (BIDU) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Baidu Inc. (BIDU)..Baidu Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy..Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Baidu Inc. here>>>The ABR suggests buying Baidu Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-bidu-buy-wall-133009562.html,Market Risk

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?.Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together..The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Baidu had debt of CN¥71.0b at the end of December 2024, a reduction from CN¥76.4b over a year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds CN¥127.7b in cash, so it actually has CN¥56.7b net cash..According to the last reported balance sheet, Baidu had liabilities of CN¥81.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of CN¥63.2b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of CN¥127.7b and CN¥14.3b worth of receivables due within a year. So these liquid assets roughly match the total liabilities..This state of affairs indicates that Baidu's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the CN¥221.5b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Baidu boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!. Check out our latest analysis for Baidu .But the other side of the story is that Baidu saw its EBIT decline by 3.4% over the last year. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Baidu's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.

Yet, AI Cloud shines. Will it be enough to offset the weakness?","Baidu, Inc. BIDU is scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 21, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, Baidu reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.63, which significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78. Total revenues were $4.68 billion, which declined 2% year over year but beat analyst estimates by 2.5%. The top-line pressure stemmed from persistent weakness in online marketing, which was partially offset by robust gains in the AI Cloud segment.Baidu Core revenues grew modestly 1% year over year to $3.8 billion, reflecting mixed performance across business lines. Notably, the AI Cloud business delivered robust fourth-quarter performance with revenues accelerating 26% year over year, offsetting the softness in the online marketing business.This Chinese tech giant beat on earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 19.1%. You can see the historical figures in the chart below..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter EPS has increased to $1.96 from $1.65 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 29% year-over-year decrease. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $4.3 billion, suggesting a 1.6% year-over-year decline. For 2025, BIDU is expected to witness 1.7% revenue growth from the 2024 level.The company is expected to register a 4.3% year-over-year decline in EPS for this year..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Baidu this reporting cycle. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Baidu has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here..Baidu’s first-quarter revenues are expected to have declined, given macroeconomic headwinds and a sluggish advertising recovery. The real drag continues to be Baidu’s core online marketing business (which forms a substantial portion of Baidu's revenues), which fell 7% year over year in the last reported quarter. Despite the ongoing efforts to infuse generative AI into search, 22% of result pages now feature AI-generated content, though monetization is yet to scale. Management indicated that meaningful revenue lift from GenAI will take time, with modest advertising recovery expected in the first half of 2025.  This downward trajectory is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter amid China's sluggish economic recovery and reduced advertising spending.China’s macroeconomic environment remains fragile due to the ongoing deflationary trends and persistent instability in the property sector. These factors are likely to have constrained advertising budgets and dampened enterprise IT spending, both of which are crucial to Baidu’s core and cloud businesses. The challenging backdrop might have added another layer of pressure to Baidu’s first-quarter performance.Adding to these concerns is the continued weakness in Baidu’s iQIYI segment, which recorded a 14% year-over-year revenue decline in the last quarter. With little indication of a rebound, similar softness is expected to have continued in the first quarter, reflecting ongoing difficulties in monetizing content and subscriber growth amid broader consumer caution.While overall results are expected to be soft, Baidu’s AI Cloud segment remains a critical growth engine. Last quarter, AI Cloud revenues rose 26% year over year, fueled by the adoption of Baidu’s ERNIE foundation models and Tianfeng MaaS platform. As inference costs fall and businesses scale their use of generative AI tools, management expects sustained momentum in 2025. ERNIE’s daily API calls surged to 1.65 billion in the fourth quarter, with external usage climbing 178% quarter over quarter. Continued traction could have helped offset ad-related softness in the first quarter.Increased costs tied to AI infrastructure expansion are expected to have weighed on the company’s profitability. As Baidu deepens its AI capabilities and ramps up its autonomous driving unit, maintaining operational discipline will be key. Nonetheless, the improvement in AI Cloud's operating margins might have helped buffer overall margin compression, as Baidu focused on high-value enterprise contracts and optimized its infrastructure for scale and efficiency.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-gears-post-q1-earnings-144600187.html,Financial Risk: Earnings Disappointment Category: Company Performance and Market Sentiment Risk Level: High

Her flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK)  underperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite through March and April amid broader market volatility..However, as of May 16, ARKK has started to recover, showing a 1.32% gain for the year, slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 1.30% gain and outperforming the Nasdaq’s 0.52% loss..Wood gained a remarkable 153% in 2020, which helped build her reputation and attract loyal investors.

But its virtually certain...,"As an investor its worth striving to ensure your overall portfolio beats the market average. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) shareholders, since the share price is down 28% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 58%. Contrary to the longer term story, the last month has been good for stockholders, with a share price gain of 8.3%. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 14% in the same time..With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time..During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Baidu actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 33% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past..It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price..Revenue is actually up 3.5% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. It's probably worth investigating Baidu further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity..You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values)..Baidu is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates..Investors in Baidu had a tough year, with a total loss of 19%, against a market gain of about 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

Let's look at Michael Burry, the investor who bet against the housing market in 2008. He was made famous by the film The Big Short. He is now betting against Nvidia. Burry purchased put options which profit from put price declines on the chipmaker. He also bought puts on China stocks like Alibaba, Baidu, jd.com, and then liquidated the majority of his portfolio. Not required in the disclosure is the why behind the moves, so we don't know why he's selling Nvidia, but when it comes to China stocks, he was previously a buyer and has slowly been unwinding his positions as those stocks have outperformed in the first quarter, perhaps a little profit trimming there. His firm Scion only has one remaining equity stake, and it's in Estee Lauder, the shares up about 7/10 of a percent at the moment, but we saw a huge pop off the back of that news from Michael Burry's firm there. .Well, speaking of Nvidia. .Speaking of Nvidia, the company reportedly increasing its stake in CoreWeave. The AI infrastructure stock surging on the news. You can see here those shares up nearly 19%. Of course, Nvidia already having a stake in the company previously. Let's talk a little bit more about this. Nvidia reporting the stake in the cloud computing provider to over 24 million shares. Again, that's 7% of outstanding shares. This disclosure was made in a 13G filing where companies have to report their holdings to the SEC. Nvidia was expected to have a little over a 5% stake in the company after CoreWeave's IPO. This was shown in a prospectus that was out on March 31st. Nvidia did anchor CoreWeave's IPO back towards the end of March with an order of about $250 million worth of shares. That was roughly 17% of the deal. And that is according to reporting from the company Bloomberg News. But you've got a huge pop in the stock off the back of this news of Nvidia again increasing its stake in CoreWeave. Those shares are up 19%. They had a strong earnings result this quarter in terms of revenue. There were questions about the company's debt load, which did put a little bit more pressure on the stock, but that's certainly being ignored in a focus instead on Nvidia reporting an increased stake in CoreWeave here.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Baidu Inc. (BIDU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this web search company have returned +8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Baidu Inc. falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Baidu Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.96 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..The consensus earnings estimate of $10.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.58 indicates a change of +14.9% from what Baidu Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Baidu Inc.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-baidu-inc-130013102.html,Market Sentiment Risk

The Chinese tech company is eyeing Switzerland and Turkey as its first European markets, as it steps up international ambitions for its driverless taxi business..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BIDU..Apollo Go already operates fully autonomous taxis in several Chinese cities, including Beijing suburbs and Wuhan, where more than 70% of rides were driverless as of April. The company expects that figure to hit 100% in the coming quarters. Fares are often subsidized, making the service more accessible as Baidu continues testing and expansion..In recent months, Baidu has announced plans to launch Apollo Go in Dubai and Abu Dhabi and has begun testing in Hong Kong. The company declined to comment on its European move when contacted by CNBC..Chinese regulators typically approve fully autonomous operations after phased testing, including trials with and without safety drivers. The regulatory process has allowed Baidu to steadily scale Apollo Go across major cities at home..The international push comes as competition in the robotaxi space heats up. Pony.AI, a rival backed by Toyota, recently announced a partnership with Uber to bring its vehicles onto the U.S. platform, with plans to expand into the Middle East this year..Baidu's ability to manage local regulations, infrastructure challenges and competition will be key as it tries to establish a foothold outside China.

(BIDU) closed at $92.50, marking a +1.55% move from the previous day.","Baidu Inc. (BIDU) ended the recent trading session at $92.50, demonstrating a +1.55% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.1%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.21%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.72%..The web search company's stock has climbed by 7.74% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 14.29% and the S&P 500's gain of 9.86%..The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Baidu Inc. in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 21, 2025. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.96, marking a 28.99% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.3 billion, down 1.56% from the year-ago period..For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.08 per share and revenue of $18.8 billion, which would represent changes of -4.27% and +1.65%, respectively, from the prior year..It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Baidu Inc. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability..Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model..The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.06% higher within the past month. Baidu Inc. is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)..Investors should also note Baidu Inc.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 9.04. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 19.32, which means Baidu Inc. is trading at a discount to the group..It is also worth noting that BIDU currently has a PEG ratio of 2.16. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Services industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.65.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-bidu-exceeds-market-214512153.html,Market Risk

It is scrutinizing FSD's performance in tough conditions.","Electric vehicle behemoth Tesla TSLA is set to roll out its long-awaited robotaxi service to customers next month. Using Tesla’s in-house app, users will be able to book a driverless ride powered by the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software..But before the excitement fully kicks in, federal safety regulators are stepping in with questions. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into Tesla’s FSD system, specifically how it performs in tricky driving conditions like rain, fog, and glare. The probe follows four reported crashes involving Tesla’s FSD (Supervised) software and is now focused on the upcoming “unsupervised” version that will power the robotaxi service..Although Tesla has already tested a supervised version of the robotaxi with employees in Austin and San Francisco, where a driver still sits behind the wheel, the public rollout is likely to be fully autonomous, without a backup driver onboard..NHTSA wants Tesla to prove its cars are truly ready to navigate public roads without a driver. The agency has sent Tesla a detailed list of questions and set a June 19 deadline for a response. Failure to comply could mean daily fines..Musk is betting big on his autonomous vehicle vision. He believes robotaxis and self-driving tech could revolutionize transportation—and potentially boost the value of Tesla fivefold. But safety comes first. Time will tell if Tesla can meet the challenge and deliver on its bold promises..As Tesla’s robotaxi services for consumers are hitting the road next month, competitors like Alphabet GOOGL and Baidu BIDU already hold an early advantage in this race. While Tesla is yet to launch, these tech giants are well on their way to reaching scale..Alphabet’s Waymo is currently dominating the robotaxi market. With years of experience, extensive real-world testing and strategic partnerships, Waymo is already running commercial services in four U.S. cities, offering over 250,000 paid rides per week. Last year, Alphabet committed to investing $5 billion in Waymo over multiple years..Baidu is expanding its robotaxi service, Apollo Go, which already operates in multiple Chinese cities, including a fleet of over 400 vehicles in Wuhan.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stands against other Michael Burry stocks with huge upside potential..Michael Burry, founder and manager of Scion Asset Management, is best known for predicting and profiting from the housing bubble’s collapse in the mid-2000s. His bold contrarian bet was famously chronicled in the book and film “The Big Short.” Burry’s investment strategy draws heavily from the rigorous market analysis and principles outlined in Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book “Security Analysis.” The book championed the merits of financial statement analysis, highlighting the importance of intrinsic value and structured investment principles..That said, Burry has never shied away from putting his own distinct stamp on Wall Street’s time-tested principles. By utilizing complex financial tools, such as derivative securities and short-selling, Burry has amassed a fortune, challenging conventional market wisdom. His 2001 Scion Value Fund letter provides a fascinating insight into his contrarian outlook, which prioritizes long-term value over short-term price fluctuations. Burry makes it clear that to achieve significant long-term returns, he is willing to tolerate short-term volatility. He stated:.“I will always choose the dollar bill carrying a wildly fluctuating discount rather than the dollar bill selling for a quite stable premium.”.He also has no qualms about making significant investments in a few stocks that he believes are undervalued, a tactic the investor employed to strengthen Scion’s holdings at the end of 2024..In the quarter that ended on December 31, 2024 just before DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence breakthrough sparked a $1.3 trillion surge in Chinese tech stocks, Michael Burry offloaded some of his investments in the country’s tech stocks. The moves came amid a period of high volatility for Chinese stocks, when investors appeared to be losing faith in Beijing following the implementation of a stimulus package in late September. The government’s actions triggered a wild rally until early October, though momentum waned due to a property crisis, a poor economic outlook, and dissatisfaction with the scope of fiscal stimulus in the following months..For this article, we examined Scion Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to list down Michael Burry’s stock picks with the highest upside potential.

(AAPL), long dominant in the smartphone and personal computing markets, is now grappling with significant headwinds in China that will likely weigh on growth in the near term. As anticipated, the company is beginning to address these issues, driven by the absence of a foldable smartphone offering and underwhelming AI capabilities..Discover companies with rock-solid fundamentals in  TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter..Receive undervalued stocks, resilient to market uncertainty,  delivered straight to your inbox..While Apple has not officially confirmed a foldable device, Bloomberg reports suggest it is close to rolling out its Apple Intelligence AI suite in China, following delays since last October. Though this marks progress, I remain neutral on the stock, as I believe the current valuation fairly reflects the company’s fundamentals, offering limited upside and little margin of safety..My concerns regarding Apple’s continued growth stem from its poor recent performance in China, one of the company’s most important target markets, hauling in 17% of revenue in the previous financial year. Most recently, Apple’s China revenue fell 8% YoY, and in Q2 FY2025, China revenue declined over 2%, suggesting that struggles are continuing in the new financial year as well. A closer study of Apple’s performance in China reveals that the failure to launch a foldable smartphone in China has cost the company market share..According to Canalys data, Apple’s China smartphone shipments were 42.9 million in 2024, a notable 17% YoY decline. As a result, the company’s market share fell to 15%, behind Vivo and Huawei. Interestingly, both Vivo and Huawei reported strong shipment growth in 2024 (11% and 37%, respectively), which reveals Apple’s struggles are isolated..Interestingly, while total smartphone shipments in China grew just 4% in 2024, foldable smartphone shipments grew 27% YoY, confirming the tailwinds supporting this niche market segment. With a market share of almost 50% in the foldable smartphone segment, Huawei led the way in 2024 (four of the five best-selling foldable smartphones in 2024 were Huawei models)..Although there are rumors of a foldable iPhone, Apple has yet to confirm them. As long as the company fails to cater to the surging demand for foldable smartphones in China, Apple is unlikely to reverse market share losses in the foreseeable future..Another factor that has kept me cautious on Apple recently is the lackluster progress the company has made with AI. In China, the lack of AI features has led to dissatisfied customers. A survey conducted by Canalys found that Chinese consumers had the strongest AI inclination among the top three smartphone markets in the world (China, the U.S., and India). Data revealed that 43% of Chinese consumers have a high AI inclination, compared to just 15% in the U.S. Although Apple’s AI deficit may not harm U.S. sales, applying the same playbook to China has already proven to be costly.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-scrambles-regain-chinese-092508266.html,1.

76,2025-05-09 00:03:00,Baidu Stock Trades 25% Below 52-Week High: Should You Buy the Dip?,"Trading below highs, surging in AI: Is Baidu quietly turning the corner?","Baidu, Inc. BIDU shares have gained 7.8% in the past month, above the Zacks Internet – Services industry’s 3.4% increase and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s rise of 4.5%. Despite this uptick, BIDU remains about 25.4% below its 52-week high of $116.25 (versus a low of $74.71). In fact, the stock is up by only 3% year to date (YTD) against the industry’s 11.8% decline.Additionally, as the threat of delisting Chinese stocks from U.S. markets is escalating, does Baidu now present an attractive entry point, or are there further challenges ahead? Could this be a good opportunity to invest in this AI stock now?.BIDU Share Price Performance.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Baidu shares are trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research..Let’s analyze the company’s prospects..Chinese tech giant Baidu has filed a patent proposing an AI-powered system to translate animal vocalizations, particularly those of pets like cats, into human language. The technology would analyze data such as sounds, behaviors, and physiological signals to identify an animal’s emotional state, then map those emotions to semantic meanings. While still in the research phase, Baidu envisions this system as a way to enhance emotional understanding and communication between animals and humans. The move aligns with Baidu’s broader push into AI, following its development of the Ernie 4.5 Turbo model..In April 2025, Baidu unveiled its latest AI model, ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, at the Baidu Create 2025 developer conference, marking a significant advancement in its artificial intelligence capabilities. ERNIE 4.5 Turbo processes and generates content across various formats, including text, images, audio, and video, enhancing its versatility in applications such as content creation and customer service. Baidu has significantly reduced the pricing for ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, offering it at 20% of ERNIE 4.5's cost and approximately 0.2% of GPT-4.5's rates, making advanced AI more accessible to developers and businesses. Alongside ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, Baidu introduced ERNIE X1 Turbo, a reasoning model designed to excel in tasks requiring deep thinking and logical analysis. It boasts enhanced capabilities in question answering, literary creation, and logical reasoning, outperforming comparable models like DeepSeek's R1 while being offered at half the cost.Baidu’s leadership in AI – from ERNIE Bot (one of China’s leading generative AI platforms) to autonomous driving – could pay off handsomely as these technologies commercialize. The company is already monetizing AI cloud services at a rapid clip, and wider AI adoption in China’s enterprises and government could drive a new growth cycle. Furthermore, Baidu’s core search business, although mature, remains a cash cow with a dominant market share in China. If China’s economy accelerates or advertising spend bounces back, Baidu could see a resurgence in its high-margin ad revenue.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-stock-trades-25-below-160300860.html,1.

In fourth-quarter 2024, the company reported revenues of $34.2 million and a net loss of $180.3 million. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Year to date, SMR shares have lost 7.4%, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Electric Power Generation industry’s decline of 9.1% and 9.5%, respectively.Let us see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement..NuScale Power Corporation price-consensus-chart | NuScale Power Corporation Quote.NuScale Power’s first-quarter performance is likely to have been driven by strong demand for clean energy powering AI-supported data centers. SMR is benefiting from a series of strategic initiatives that are aimed at aligning resources with its primary objective of moving toward commercialization and revenue-producing commercial contracts.NuScale Power’s collaboration with ENTRA1 Energy continues to gain traction, with a commercial model that mitigates risks and aligns with the needs of potential customers. This model’s success in meeting scalability, availability, and reliability needs is likely to have been crucial for SMR deployments in the to-be-reported quarter.The company established a supply chain, including its partnership with Doosan Enerbility, which allows the company to maintain its manufacturing readiness. Doosan has continued to advance the first six NuScale Power Modules, the only NRC-approved SMRs currently in production. During the fourth quarter, NuScale, along with Doosan and ENTRA1, began securing long-lead materials for six additional modules to support customer interest in 12-module configurations. The ongoing progress in manufacturing and retooling facilities for SMR production is likely to have reduced lead times, increasing the ability to meet growing demand.NuScale Power’s ongoing transition from a research & development-focused organization to a company pursuing commercialization activities is expected to have reduced operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter..SMR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)..Here are some companies in the broader sector that are set to report their quarterly results.Baidu BIDU has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Why investors should take advantage now.,"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings..We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises..The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction..Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Baidu Inc. (BIDU) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.13 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 21, 2025..Baidu Inc.'s Earnings ESP sits at 8.67%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.13 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96..BIDU is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Atlassian (TEAM)..Slated to report earnings on August 7, 2025, Atlassian holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.83 a share 91 days from its next quarterly update..The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Atlassian is $0.83, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.64%..BIDU and TEAM's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon..Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

85,2025-05-06 00:00:00,Baidu Inc. (BIDU) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,"Baidu Inc. (BIDU) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects. This might drive the stock higher in the near term.","Baidu Inc. (BIDU) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices..The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate..The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time..Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Baidu Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price..The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock..For Baidu Inc. rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher..As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions..The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Let's take a closer look..Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits..Currently, Baidu Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Shopify has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that BIDU likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than SHOP has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this..Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels..Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years..BIDU currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.92, while SHOP has a forward P/E of 68.45. We also note that BIDU has a PEG ratio of 2.13. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. SHOP currently has a PEG ratio of 3.02..Another notable valuation metric for BIDU is its P/B ratio of 0.83. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SHOP has a P/B of 11.12..These metrics, and several others, help BIDU earn a Value grade of A, while SHOP has been given a Value grade of F..BIDU sticks out from SHOP in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that BIDU is the better option right now..Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(BIDU) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Baidu Inc. (BIDU)..Baidu Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy..Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Baidu Inc. here>>>The ABR suggests buying Baidu Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

While a confluence of factors is responsible for lifting all three of Wall Street's major stock indexes to new heights in 2024 (and early 2025 for the S&P 500), it's the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) that stands head-and-shoulders above other catalysts..The broad-stroke excitement with AI is that it allows enabled software and systems to reason and act on their own. Looking a bit further down the line, machine learning, when coupled with AI capabilities, can lead to software and systems learning new jobs and skillsets, all without human oversight..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».The global addressable market for artificial intelligence is vast.

As most would know, fundamentals are what...","Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock is up by a considerable 9.1% over the past month. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Baidu's  ROE in this article..Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..The formula for ROE is:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Baidu is:.8.5% = CN¥24b ÷ CN¥284b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024)..The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.. See our latest analysis for Baidu .Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics..When you first look at it, Baidu's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 7.8%, we may spare it some thought. Having said that, Baidu has shown a modest net income growth of 6.8% over the past five years. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio..We then compared Baidu's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-role-play-driving-baidu-120035260.html,Market Risk

The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on May 21, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.96, reflecting a 28.99% decrease from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $4.3 billion, reflecting a 1.56% fall from the equivalent quarter last year..For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.08 per share and revenue of $18.8 billion, which would represent changes of -4.27% and +1.65%, respectively, from the prior year..Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Baidu Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability..Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system..The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index..As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Baidu. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Baidu's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters..Baidu is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Yanhong Li with 20% of shares outstanding. PRIMECAP Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 3.5% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.3% of the company stock..Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder..While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily..While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Baidu BIDU, Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY and Alibaba BABA..China’s tech giants Baidu and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have both emerged as major players in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Baidu – often called the “Google of China” – dominates Internet search and online advertising in its home market, while Tencent runs the ubiquitous WeChat super-app and a vast gaming and social media empire. Both companies are investing heavily in AI, from large language models to cloud computing and autonomous driving, making them prime candidates for investors seeking exposure to AI growth..Importantly, Baidu and Tencent share several similarities that put them at the forefront of China’s AI boom. Each leverages a massive user base (WeChat alone has nearly 1.4 billion users) and rich data resources to train AI systems. Each also enjoys strong government and ecosystem support in China’s push to lead in AI innovation. With generative AI taking off globally, both firms launched their own high-profile AI models – Baidu introduced its ERNIE Bot (a ChatGPT-like chatbot) and Tencent rolled out its Hunyuan foundation model, signaling their intent to stay competitive. In the current AI investing landscape, these two companies are frequently compared as China’s best AI bets..Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu is the leading search engine provider in China, controlling the lion’s share of the online search market (earning it the “Google of China” nickname).

Beyond search, Baidu has expanded into AI cloud services, autonomous driving (its Apollo unit), and smart devices. In fact, Baidu has been strategically transforming from an Internet-centric to an AI-first business..Baidu has emerged as a frontrunner in China’s AI race. Its ERNIE Bot quickly gained over 200 million users and handled 1.65 billion daily API calls by late 2024, driven by strong developer and enterprise uptake.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) stands against the other self-driving car stocks..The term “self-driving car stocks” describes publicly traded businesses engaged in creating, manufacturing, or using autonomous vehicle technology. These businesses either directly contribute to the development of self-driving systems or offer crucial parts and services to the autonomous driving industry..The autonomous vehicle market is booming. Grand View Research estimates that the global market for autonomous vehicles was worth $68.09 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9% from 2025 to 2030. The industry is driven by the significant demand for tech adoption by customers, road safety, connectivity, advancements in AI, and sensor technology. In 2024, the passenger vehicle segment led the industry and accounted for 69% of the global revenue. The North American autonomous vehicle market dominated the global market with a share of over 37.1% in 2024..On the other hand, according to Goldman Sachs Research, Level 3 autonomous cars, which permit hands-off, eyes-off driving in some situations, might make up as much as 10% of new cars sold globally by 2030, down from a previous estimate of 12%. It is anticipated that level 4 fully autonomous vehicles will account for 2.5% of sales, up from 3.5% in the past. Vehicles classified as Level 2 and Level 2+, which need to be supervised, are projected to rise from 20% at present to 30% by 2027. Adoption is expected to speed up due to AI advancements and declining hardware prices, notwithstanding delays caused by technological, legislative, and business model obstacles. By 2030, a market for robotaxis valued at over $25 billion would develop, driven by commercial AV fleets. By 2030, the cost of an AV mile might be less than $1, and by 2040, it could be $0.58. Long-term, AVs may account for 60% of new light vehicle sales worldwide by 2040, with China dominating (90%), followed by Europe (80%), and the United States (65%)..As per S&P Global’s report, the industry’s focus on self-driving cars has changed from lofty Level 5 autonomy to practical, incremental applications. Tech firms and manufacturers came together at CES 2025 with realistic objectives, especially in the area of Level 4 autonomy. Companies increasingly prefer deployable technology, such as ride-hailing services and automated shuttles, above completely autonomous personal vehicles. Leading this shift is Waymo, which reports more than 4 million trips overall and 150,000 paid rides weekly. It displayed new Hyundai and Zeekr automobiles, growing its business in additional American cities and adjusting to local laws.

100,2025-04-26 00:03:00,Baidu vs. Tencent: Which Chinese AI Stock Is the Better Buy Now?,"China's AI race is heating up. With Tencent's AI already boosting earnings, can Baidu's ERNIE Bot catch up?","China’s tech giants Baidu BIDU and Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY have both emerged as major players in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Baidu – often called the “Google of China” – dominates Internet search and online advertising in its home market, while Tencent runs the ubiquitous WeChat super-app and a vast gaming and social media empire. Both companies are investing heavily in AI, from large language models to cloud computing and autonomous driving, making them prime candidates for investors seeking exposure to AI growth.Importantly, Baidu and Tencent share several similarities that put them at the forefront of China’s AI boom. Each leverages a massive user base (WeChat alone has nearly 1.4 billion users) and rich data resources to train AI systems. Each also enjoys strong government and ecosystem support in China’s push to lead in AI innovation. With generative AI taking off globally, both firms launched their own high-profile AI models – Baidu introduced its ERNIE Bot (a ChatGPT-like chatbot) and Tencent rolled out its Hunyuan foundation model, signaling their intent to stay competitive. In the current AI investing landscape, these two companies are frequently compared as China’s best AI bets.Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu is the leading search engine provider in China, controlling the lion’s share of the online search market (earning it the “Google of China” nickname). This core search and advertising business generates healthy cash flow that Baidu has been channeling into AI initiatives. Beyond search, Baidu has expanded into AI cloud services, autonomous driving (its Apollo unit), and smart devices. In fact, Baidu has been strategically transforming from an Internet-centric to an AI-first business.Baidu has emerged as a frontrunner in China’s AI race. Its ERNIE Bot quickly gained over 200 million users and handled 1.65 billion daily API calls by late 2024, driven by strong developer and enterprise uptake. The company plans to release an open-source ERNIE 4.5 model with enhanced multimodal reasoning in 2025. Beyond chatbots, Baidu’s Apollo Go robotaxis delivered over 1.1 million rides in the fourth quarter, pushing cumulative rides past 9 million while expanding to new cities, including Hong Kong.Despite these advances, in cloud computing and AI, Baidu faces competition from Alibaba's BABA Alibaba Cloud and Tencent's cloud services. Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) is the leading cloud provider in China, offering a wide range of enterprise services. This means that Baidu must continue to innovate rapidly to maintain an edge.Baidu’s latest financial results paint a mixed picture. Cost controls and efficiency gains boosted profitability even as top-line growth stalled. In 2024, Baidu’s revenues were slightly down, reflecting challenges in its advertising business. On the positive side, Baidu’s AI Cloud segment remained a bright spot, with cloud revenues growing 17% in 2024, and management noted accelerating demand for AI services.Baidu’s management emphasized that 2024 was a pivotal year that validated Baidu’s AI pivot, and expects AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025. Baidu also maintains a solid financial foundation with RMB 170.5 billion in net cash (roughly $24 billion) on its balance sheet and healthy free cash flow of RMB 13.1 billion. In 2024, the company repurchased over $1 billion worth of shares (part of a $5 billion buyback program), signaling confidence from management and providing support to the stock. This combination of improving margins, prudent cash management, and ongoing AI-driven growth initiatives bodes well for Baidu’s financial trajectory, provided revenue can re-accelerate as the economy and new AI products gain steam.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-tencent-chinese-ai-160300018.html,- Market Risk - Regulatory Risk - Industry Risk - Business Risk - Technological Risk

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks..Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels..Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category.

Over the past year, BIDU's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.35 and as low as 6.86, with a median of 8.25..Finally, our model also underscores that BIDU has a P/CF ratio of 4.84. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 13.38. Within the past 12 months, BIDU's P/CF has been as high as 6.91 and as low as 4.37, with a median of 5.26..These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Baidu is likely being undervalued right now.

She was particularly busy with the market moving higher yesterday.

Let's take a closer look at the Wood's three fresh purchases..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Shares of Nvidia have fallen 26% this year, and that's after a bounce in Tuesday's trading. It's a laggard in the near term for Ark's performance. Zoom out, though, and the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader starts looking a lot better. It's up 24% over the past year, a dazzling 14-bagger over the past five years..Nvidia has come a long way since its early days, when the top dog in graphics processing units was appreciated largely by fans of PC gaming. Nvidia now finds itself at the intersection of buzzy trends, but the strongest is clearly the AI revolution. Developers need a lot of computing power to train and run their AI models, and Nvidia is the leading provider in the chips that make these language learning models fly..There have been some headwinds lately. In January came the announcement from China's DeepSeek that it could deliver respectable AI results with older Nvidia chips. Lately, the trade war has been leaving its mark. Between the effective shipment ban to China and fears of an economic slowdown, investors have soured on Nvidia's near-term prospects..Two different analysts slashed their profit targets ahead of Tuesday's open. Vivek Arya of Bank of America lowered his price goal from $160 to $150. Tom O'Malley at Barclays took his target down $20 to $155. Estimates remain roughly where they were three months ago, when the shares trading much higher. Wall Street pros seem to think valuation multiples should contract to account for consumer risk and one-time hits on China. The silver lining is that both analysts are still bullish on the shares, and even the new price points offer more than 50% of upside from today's levels..There are a lot of companies riding Nvidia's coattails, but AMD is no Nvidia. This chip stock is down 42% over the past year. It's barely halfway to doubling over the past five years. AMD is naturally susceptible to U.S. export controls, and now its once promising MI308X processor is banned from being sold into China.

This move potentially aligns with the company's broader goal of increasing its global footprint, enhancing both brand recognition and future revenue streams. Analysts have noted Baidu's strong AI Cloud growth, and such partnerships underscore this momentum by leveraging AI expertise to improve operational scalability and customer engagement..Baidu's shares rose 10% following the announcement, yet over the last year, total shareholder returns, including dividends, have declined by 12.04%. This contrasts with the broader US Interactive Media and Services industry, which saw a modest growth of 2% over the same period. Consequently, Baidu has underperformed both the industry and the wider US market, which returned 5.9% during this timeframe..The expansion into new markets like Dubai might influence future revenue and earnings by diversifying income streams and potentially offsetting declining revenues in core online marketing. Baidu has seen a 7% year-over-year reduction in marketing revenue, but strategic moves like these could bolster the company’s revenue forecasts. Analysts currently anticipate Baidu's earnings to rise to CN¥25.7 billion by April 2028..Despite the recent share price increase, Baidu's current trading price of US$76.86 remains below the consensus price target of US$109.62, implying significant appreciation potential.

121,2025-04-14 21:30:00,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Baidu Inc. (BIDU): Should You Buy?,"The average brokerage recommendation (ABR) for Baidu Inc. (BIDU) is equivalent to a Buy. The overly optimistic recommendations of Wall Street analysts make the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric questionable. So, is it worth buying the stock?","When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Baidu Inc. (BIDU)..Baidu Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.95, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.95 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 52.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Baidu Inc. here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Baidu Inc., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133009552.html,Market Risk (Investment Risk)

Incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins will likely oversee the delisting issue when he officially assumes office, the author says, noting that such a move would come amid a trade war with China but also amid a growing GOP congressional appetite to delist Chinese companies.

The “EU is very smart, but they really have taken advantage of the United States,” Trump also stated. President Trump was speaking with reporters following a cabinet meeting..WATER OWED: President Donald Trump stated in a Truth Social post, “Mexico OWES Texas 1.3 million acre-feet of water under the 1944 Water Treaty, but Mexico is unfortunately violating their Treaty obligation. This is very unfair, and it is hurting South Texas Farmers very badly. Last year, the only Sugar Mill in Texas CLOSED, because Mexico has been stealing the water from Texas Farmers. Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to get South Texas the water it is owed, but Sleepy Joe refused to lift a finger to help the Farmers. THAT ENDS NOW! I will make sure Mexico doesn’t violate our Treaties, and doesn’t hurt our Texas Farmers. Just last month, I halted water shipments to Tijuana until Mexico complies with the 1944 Water Treaty.

The brokerage models how Trip.com, Tencent Music, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) would fare in the event of a 1% decline in China’s GDP growth.","Investing.com -- U.S. export tariffs on China are renewing investor concerns over macro risks. Bernstein has analysed which Chinese internet companies can best weather a slowdown. The brokerage models how Trip.com, Tencent Music, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) would fare in the event of a 1% decline in China’s GDP growth..Trip.com and Tencent Music showed greater resiliency, each seeing about a 1.5% reduction in revenue under the simulated downturn. Baidu, however, faced a sharper 3% hit, the brokerage said..Bernstein attributes Trip.com’s resilience to long-term secular tailwinds in domestic travel and growing digital penetration in the online travel agency (OTA) sector. Even in prior economic downturns, trip volumes continued to rise as consumers downtraded within travel but maintained their intent to travel, the analysts said..A 1% GDP hit would likely drive down outbound travel by 5% and hotel growth by 2%, but domestic substitution helps cushion the blow, Bernstein wrote, cutting FY growth expectations for Trip.com from 16% to 14%..Tencent Music benefits from a sticky premium user base and recurring revenue from music streaming subscriptions, Bernstein said. While a macro slowdown may prompt promotions and ARPU pressure for select cohorts, the company can limit the impact by targeting discounts to specific user segments..That approach could limit revenue downside to roughly 1.7%, Bernstein estimated..Baidu’s ad-heavy business, particularly in cyclical segments like ecommerce and autos, makes it more vulnerable to macro shocks, with no secular growth offsets or pricing power to fall back on. Search remains exposed to economically sensitive categories and lacks the lock-in benefits seen elsewhere, the analysts said..Bernstein names Trip.com its top pick, citing undemanding valuation at 13x forward P/E and structural growth drivers that remain intact. Tencent Music is also favored as a stable earnings story, though Bernstein sees its valuation as fair. Baidu, in contrast, may face further downside from macro risks that threaten to derail its AI monetization narrative, the firm warned..Related articles.Tao Group teams up with YellowHeart on NFT ticketing.How has Europe’s economy been affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine?.UK prosecutors authorise indecent assault charges against Harvey Weinstein",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resilient-china-internet-names-tariff-205847024.html,1.

(BIDU) and Shopify (SHOP). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look..The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits..Currently, Baidu Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Shopify has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that BIDU has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors..Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels..Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use..BIDU currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.63, while SHOP has a forward P/E of 51.90. We also note that BIDU has a PEG ratio of 1.82. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. SHOP currently has a PEG ratio of 2.26..Another notable valuation metric for BIDU is its P/B ratio of 0.72. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SHOP has a P/B of 8.63..These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BIDU's Value grade of A and SHOP's Value grade of F..BIDU stands above SHOP thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that BIDU is the superior value option right now..Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

128,2025-04-08 23:55:00,3 Stocks That Cathie Wood Is Buying During the Stock Market Sell-Off,The aggressive growth investor kicked off the new trading week with a few notable purchases.,"There is opportunity in the volatility. Cathie Wood is a widely watched growth investor who has steered her Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds to success when equity prices are rising. She's also not afraid to put money to work when stocks are sliding..Wood added to her stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and Iridium Communications (NASDAQ: IRDM) on Monday, a day that featured the market's widest swing in the last five years. The three stocks are trading well below their recent highs. Let's take a closer look at the growth prospects from these three investments at current levels..Shares of Nvidia have cooled down after more than tripling in 2023, and tacking on another 171% jump last year. The chipmaker has fallen 27% this year as of Monday's close, down a blistering 36% since hitting an all-time high just three months ago..Nvidia is the country's third most valuable company by market cap. Its pole position in graphics processing units with gamers has widened over the years, and now it's the undisputed top dog in artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The surge in demand for data centers to crank out generative AI is making Nvidia one of the world's fastest growing megacaps. Nvidia is also at the intersection of other booming trends from autonomous driving to virtual reality..Revenue more than doubled for five consecutive fiscal quarters, decelerating to 94% and then 78% in its last reports. Most companies would love to be delivering year-over-year top-line gains of 78%, but tailwinds are bumping up against headwinds here. Against the backdrop of booming demand, Nvidia took an initial stumble in January after China's DeepSeek announced that it was able to crank out AI results with seemingly outdated Nvidia chips. The pullback has intensified on the impact of what the tariff-fueled trade war will do to global demand for Nvidia's industry-leading solutions..There is good news for opportunistic investors. Nvidia entered this volatile week trading for just 21 times this year's earnings and 16 times next year's target. It's a compelling value proposition for a company growing as quickly as Nvidia. Sure, the semiconductor industry itself is historically cyclical. However, there should still be a couple of more years of robust double-digit growth as long as the tailwinds don't overcome the headwinds..Baidu stock has fallen 31% from its October high-water mark, but the math grows more unkind if you scroll back to its all-time high. China's leading search engine operator has plummeted 78% since peaking four years ago. Like Nvidia, Baidu is also at the leading edge of buzzy industries. More than just a search engine, Baidu is a player in autonomous driving, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and naturally AI as well.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-cathie-wood-buying-155500321.html,Market Volatility Risk
129,2025-04-08 21:40:00,Should Value Investors Buy Baidu (BIDU) Stock?,"Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.","While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies..Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large..On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today..One company to watch right now is Baidu (BIDU). BIDU is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 7.85, which compares to its industry's average of 16.27. Over the last 12 months, BIDU's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.35 and as low as 6.86, with a median of 8.25..Finally, investors will want to recognize that BIDU has a P/CF ratio of 4.69. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. BIDU's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.78. Within the past 12 months, BIDU's P/CF has been as high as 6.91 and as low as 4.40, with a median of 5.31..These are just a handful of the figures considered in Baidu's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that BIDU is an impressive value stock right now..Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today, Tepper's net worth tops $21 billion.  The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks skyrocketed in 2024, and Appaloosa Management profited from their momentum, as several of those giant tech companies were among its top holdings.","The S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) average annual total return over the long term has been around 10%. Hedge fund manager David Tepper has achieved an average annual return of more than 25% since the inception of his firm, Appaloosa Management, in 1993..Today, Tepper's net worth tops $21 billion. Clearly, he has made better decisions than most investors throughout much of his career. But does the billionaire investor know something now that the rest of Wall Street doesn't?.The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks skyrocketed in 2024, and Appaloosa Management profited from their momentum, as several of those giant tech companies were among its top holdings..However, the Magnificent Seven has been the ""Lagnificent Seven"" so far this year. All seven stocks have fallen. Six are down by double-digit percentages, and three of those have plunged by more than 20% year to date..Tepper might have seen the writing on the wall to some extent. In the fourth quarter of 2024, he reduced Appaloosa's stake in Amazon by roughly 18.8%. He slashed the fund's position in Meta Platforms by 21.6%. The notable exception to this activity was his purchase of around 55,000 shares of Nvidia. He also left Appaloosa's position in Microsoft untouched, and sold only one share of Google parent Alphabet..His selling wasn't limited to the Magnificent Seven, though. The billionaire also reduced Appaloosa's exposure to other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, selling 11% of its stake in Oracle, 60% of its stake in Intel, and 100% of its position in Adobe..But Tepper also bought plenty of stocks in Q4. Interestingly, some of his biggest purchases had a common theme..He increased Appaloosa's position in Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA) by 18.4%. He added another 1% or so to its stake in PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD). He boosted Appaloosa's ownership of JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) by 43.4% and of Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) by 7.2%. What's the common denominator for these stocks? They're all Chinese technology companies..Alibaba is sometimes called ""the Amazon of China."" PDD shares some similarities with Amazon, thanks in part to its Temu online marketplace. Some refer to Baidu as ""the Google of China."" JD.com initially focused solely on e-commerce for Chinese companies, but has since expanded into other areas including logistics and healthcare..Like the Magnificent Seven companies, all of these Chinese tech companies are investing heavily in AI. Alibaba will soon launch a new version of its flagship Qwen large language model. PDD uses AI in its Pinduoduo and Temu apps. JD.com uses AI throughout its operations.

These 21 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early idenification of life changing disesaes like cancer and Alzheimer's..Over the past five years, Baidu's total return stood at a 16.74% decline, reflecting a challenging period for the company's shareholders. Although Baidu's AI Cloud segment experienced robust growth, with a notable 26% revenue increase year-over-year, the core online marketing business faced difficulties, as revenue decreased by 7% in a pivotal quarter. Additionally, regulatory pressures and competitive dynamics in China's AI and autonomous driving sectors created headwinds that impacted Baidu’s revenue and profit margins. The company's extensive investments in these areas have not yet translated into proportional revenue gains, burdened by high associated costs and a competitive environment..Furthermore, Baidu's expansion into new markets, such as its autonomous ride-hailing service in Dubai, has yet to affirmatively sway investor sentiment. The initiative represents a significant step for Apollo Go, potentially unlocking future growth, but it remains in the early stages. Throughout this period, efforts such as the repurchase of 14.95 million shares and significant AI model launches, like ERNIE 4.5, signify attempts to bolster long-term value, yet did not offset immediate shareholder returns.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Baidu's  ROE..Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..The formula for ROE is:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Baidu is:.8.5% = CN¥24b ÷ CN¥284b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024)..The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.. Check out our latest analysis for Baidu .We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes..On the face of it, Baidu's ROE is not much to talk about. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 7.7%. Having said that, Baidu has shown a modest net income growth of 6.8% over the past five years. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place..Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Baidu's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 19% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see..Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Baidu fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-nasdaq-bidu-stock-140116130.html,Market Risk Volatility Risk Investment Risk

The outlook for the economy is worrisome, as trade wars and promised tariffs could lead to disaster for many businesses. But that doesn't mean you should necessarily get out of the market. On the contrary -- this can be an optimal time to score some deals and investments you can hang on to for the long haul..If you've got $5,000 you can afford to invest in the stock market today, three stocks you'll want to consider loading up on right now are Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU)..Here's how cheap these three Nasdaq stocks are right now, and why they could be bargain buys..While the market has been struggling this year, shares of Amgen are up 17% so far in 2025. But even with its rally, this is still a fairly cheap healthcare stock to buy. It's trading at just under 15 times next year's estimated earnings (based on analyst estimates)..This is a good healthcare company to invest in: Not only does it have strong growth prospects, but it also pays a dividend that now yields 3.1%. Whether you want long-term gains from owning the stock or just recurring dividend income, it can be a suitable option for either goal..Last year, the company grew its top line by 19% to $33.4 billion. It has many blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, including Repatha (cholesterol) and Prolia (osteoporosis), which generated a combined $6.6 billion in sales in 2024..On top of all this, Amgen has a highly promising injectable GLP-1 treatment for weight loss, MariTide, which would only need to be taken on a monthly basis (versus weekly, as is the case with other injectable treatments). It isn't approved yet but its results have been encouraging. And if it gets the green light, the stock could quickly take off..Investors aren't all that excited with PayPal, because there's concern that with more payment options, demand for its platform will decline. However, the brand is strong, and it's still doing well despite consumers having an increased number of ways to send money and pay for goods. It's a go-to option that people are familiar with and trust, and that's why I see the payment processing company as an underrated investment..Although its growth rate hasn't been impressive of late (4% for the last three months of 2024), it comes at a time when consumers are scaling back on discretionary spending. The economy as a whole isn't doing terribly well, so it may not be surprising to see PayPal's results indicate similar challenges. The silver lining, however, is that its earnings were still fairly resilient in 2024 -- they totaled $4.1 billion and were down by just 2% year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-5-000-3-nasdaq-090500706.html,High Risk - Market Volatility

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.67% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.87%..The web search company's stock has climbed by 5.14% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 7.99% and the S&P 500's loss of 5.28%..Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Baidu Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $4.34 billion, down 0.64% from the prior-year quarter..For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.08 per share and a revenue of $18.73 billion, representing changes of -4.27% and +1.31%, respectively, from the prior year..It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Baidu Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability..Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model..The Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stands against the other emerging markets stocks..Emerging markets stocks are shares of companies based in developing countries – think Brazil, India, China, or South Africa – that are rapidly industrializing and growing their economies. Unlike the familiar and more predictable world of US stocks, emerging markets offer something quite different: higher growth potential coupled with greater volatility, influenced by unique local dynamics such as political shifts, currency swings, and evolving regulations. Why venture into these turbulent waters? Because with higher risk comes the potential for higher rewards. These markets often grow faster than mature economies, making them especially attractive if you’re looking to diversify beyond the stability (and sometimes slower pace) of US equities. Also, exposure to the best emerging markets stocks would not only boost the return profile of a portfolio, but also make it less volatile through diversification – many emerging markets exhibit little to no sensitivity to the state of the economy in the US, meaning that their national economy could continue to grow even when the US is in a recession..READ ALSO: 10 Best Emerging Technology Stocks to Buy Now.Timing matters, especially when diving into emerging markets stocks. Investing in these companies makes the most sense when global economic conditions are improving, investor sentiment is optimistic, and local political or financial uncertainties are settling down. It’s particularly appealing if you’re a patient investor who can withstand short-term volatility for potentially bigger long-term gains. Additionally, when valuations in developed markets like the US are stretched and growth appears limited, emerging markets stocks can offer a refreshing alternative, giving your portfolio both growth exposure and geographical diversification..The current tendencies we see in the global markets are highly suggestive that a potential rotation from US stocks to emerging markets stocks would be the right move to make. Despite the US market being in correction mode, valuations still appear stretched, as the whole market trades at a forward P/E above 20x, significantly above the historical average, which is around the mid-teens. This is the first factor that points toward the possibility that US stock market returns will be lower until the end of the decade due to the impact of declining valuations (or, call it a return to more normal valuations). Second, the new Trump 2.0 administration introduced a lot of noise into the US economy – the Atlanta Fed has already lowered its GDP growth estimates for the following quarters as a result of significant cuts in public spending as well as the tariff threats negatively impacting the private spending outlook. This expected economic slowdown is exclusive to the US market, while emerging markets may continue to grow their economies at a usual pace.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-bidu-among-best-225032267.html,Market Risk

This period witnessed competitive and regulatory hurdles in China's AI and autonomous driving sectors, impacting revenue streams, especially in Baidu's core online marketing segment, which saw a 7% year-over-year decline in Q4 2024. Additionally, while Baidu's AI Cloud showed strong growth, the significant costs of supporting these operations placed pressure on margins..Throughout this timeframe, the company's strategic initiatives included launching new AI models like ERNIE 4.5 and expanding autonomous services internationally, such as the Dubai Apollo Go partnership. However, despite these efforts, Baidu underperformed its industry peers and the US market over the last year.

149,2025-03-28 21:30:00,Wall Street Analysts Think Baidu Inc. (BIDU) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,"According to the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), one should invest in Baidu Inc. (BIDU). It is debatable whether this highly sought-after metric is effective because Wall Street analysts' recommendations tend to be overly optimistic. Would it be worth investing in the stock?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Baidu Inc. (BIDU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Baidu Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.95, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.95 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 52.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Baidu Inc. here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Baidu Inc., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-baidu-133009601.html,Market Risk

Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential..Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system..The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

152,2025-03-26 16:45:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than AppLovin 2 Years From Now,Baidu and CrowdStrike could eclipse AppLovin's market cap by 2027.,"AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP), a publisher of mobile games and app monetization tools, went public on April 15, 2021, at $80. Today, its stock trades at about $315 -- so a $10,000 investment would have grown to over $39,000 in less than four years..Back in 2022, AppLovin's revenue growth flatlined and it racked up a net loss as it grappled with inflation, rising rates, and other macroeconomic headwinds for the digital advertising market. That pressure offset all of its inorganic gains from its $1.1 billion takeover of MoPub. But in 2023, its revenue rose 17% and it turned profitable again as the digital advertising market stabilized..In 2024, AppLovin's revenue surged 43%, its net income skyrocketed 343%, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 81%. That growth was driven by the growing adoption of its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered AXON ad discovery services and a warming micro environment..AppLovin still has a bright future. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% and 31%, respectively. But with a market cap of $107 billion, it doesn't look cheap trading at 19 times this year's sales..If it matches those expectations and maintains the same forward valuations, its market cap could rise about 44% to $154 billion by the beginning of 2027. Yet if it trades at a more modest 10 times forward sales, its market cap could shrink 24% to $81 billion. So instead of chasing AppLovin at these frothy levels, it might be smarter to invest in two less valuable tech companies that might eclipse this hot stock's market cap in two years: Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD)..Baidu owns China's largest search engine, but it only has a market cap of $33 billion and trades at 9 times forward earnings and 2 times this year's sales. Three major challenges are compressing its valuations: competition from mobile ""super-apps"" like Tencent's (OTC: TCEHY) WeChat, the rise of new generative AI platforms that are changing how people search for information, and soft demand for Chinese equities amid the protracted tech and trade war between the U.S. and China..Those challenges are daunting, but Baidu recently launched two new AI models -- Ernie 4.5, the latest version of its foundational AI platform; and Ernie X1, an advanced reasoning model that targets DeepSeek and other generative AI services -- to keep pace with that evolving market. It's also expanding its mobile app, which served 679 million monthly active users at the end of 2024, and rolling out more managed business pages for companies to curb their dependence on search and display ads. It also recently acquired Joyy's streaming video business in China to complement its iQiyi video platform and widen its moat against ByteDance's Douyin (known as TikTok overseas) and other online video competitors.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-worth-more-084500887.html,1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Baidu, Inc.

A few months ago, many investors were expecting the U.S. economy to be in a better position and Chinese stocks were facing significant regulatory worries. However, the tables have turned with the Chinese economy expected to be in a better position compared to 2024..Things have taken a wild turn with the U.S. president imposing high tariffs and investors expecting an economic slowdown in the U.S. On the other hand, China’s advancement in AI and its capabilities to grow its AI infrastructure have intensified since the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model..“The U.S. has had a good period, and that’s coming to an end because Trump’s policies are very anti-economy. China has had a very bad period, but it looks as if it’s starting to recover,” Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told CNBC..Chinese government support for its technology sector has induced much optimism among investors. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks some of the largest Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, has soared over 21% year-to-date, as of March 25. At the same time, the NASDAQ 100 index, covering the U.S. tech stocks, has plunged over 3.70%. Whereas, the Shanghai Composite Index has risen over 3% compared to a drop of 1.70% in the S&P 500 index..“Performance of the HSCEI/MSCI China in the past 17 months trended closely to the trajectory a decade ago, making us worry that we might be approaching some correction soon,” analysts at the Bank of America wrote in a report published on March 17..Harris believes that China’s A shares have been quite depressed for some time compared to the U.S. stocks.

The fund I'm talking about is the Invesco China Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CQQQ).  In recent years, tech stocks have performed fairly well for investors.","The stock market has been falling in recent weeks, and many tech stocks have been performing especially poorly. Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 is now down more than 4%. And the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks the tech sector of the broad index, has plummeted by around 9%. High valuations in tech have been a problem for a while, and soaring expectations related to artificial intelligence (AI) certainly don't help..However, not all tech stocks are struggling. There's even a tech-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) that's doing incredibly well this year, up more than 25%. And best of all, it has the potential to go even higher. The fund I'm talking about is the Invesco China Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CQQQ)..In recent years, tech stocks have performed fairly well for investors. But Chinese-based stocks have largely underperformed, due to concerns related to government overreach in the country, and just how safe those investments really are..But earlier this year, AI company DeepSeek rolled out an AI model that was on par with its North American counterparts, including ChatGPT. And particularly unsettling for the U.S. markets, it was supposedly at just a fraction of the cost. That suggests a lot of spending on AI may not be money well spent. And if Chinese companies are able to produce similar types of chatbots, they may be better investment opportunities given the lower cost of labor in China..In the chart above, you'll notice that for the first month, the China Technology ETF was performing similarly to the S&P 500 and the tech sector. But as DeepSeek rattled the markets toward the end of January and investors began to pay more attention to Chinese tech stocks, a gap began to emerge, with the Chinese-focused fund soaring higher ever since..Although the China Technology ETF is up significantly this year, it may not be too late to invest in it. The fund averages a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 19. That's cheap when you compare it to the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund average of nearly 26. Plus, tariffs could weigh down U.S.-based tech companies for as long as they remain intact. Chinese tech companies, which are focusing primarily on Chinese markets, may be safer investment options by comparison. While that doesn't mean they won't be exposed to tariffs, the risk may be much more modest..Tencent, PDD Holdings, and Baidu are among the top holdings in the ETF, and they are among the best Chinese stocks to own.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-markets-tech-etf-over-111300010.html,- Market Volatility Risk - Investment Risk - Sector Specific Risk (Tech) - Market Timing Risk

Insider ownership in Baidu is 19%.Every investor in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 41% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)..And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders..Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Baidu.. See our latest analysis for Baidu .Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing..As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Baidu. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Baidu, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too..Hedge funds don't have many shares in Baidu. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Yanhong Li with 19% of shares outstanding. PRIMECAP Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 3.5% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.2% of the company stock..A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority..Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments.

PGR, BIDU, TGNA & JD are well-poised to gain.","The U.S. stock market is likely to remain volatile due to a combination of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical risks. While the Federal Reserve maintained its forecast for two rate cuts in 2025, it acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook..In this context, creating a curated portfolio of low-beta stocks is a prudent strategy. This provides a safeguard against heightened market fluctuations, equipping investors to navigate volatility with greater resilience and foresight..Hence, stocks like The Progressive Corporation PGR, Baidu Inc BIDU, TEGNA Inc. TGNA and JD.com, Inc. JD are worth betting on..Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset compared to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security’s price movement relative to the market. In this article, we are considering the S&P 500 as the market..If a stock has a beta of 1, then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1..For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with a beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20%, the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating..We have taken a beta between 0 and 0.6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market. However, this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy. We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio..Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks Greater Than Zero: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last month..Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable..Price Greater Than or Equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher..Zacks Rank Equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

Despite a mixed market backdrop where the Nasdaq Composite declined 8% over recent weeks, Baidu reported a share price increase of 4% over the last quarter. This performance contrast may be attributed in part to its innovative product launch and strategic integration of these models into its platforms like Baidu Search and the Wenxiaoyan app. The competitive pricing of ERNIE 4.5, at just 1% of GPT-4.5's cost, exemplifies Baidu's aggressive positioning in the AI market. Other developments, such as the completion of a CNY 10 billion notes offering, may have supported financial stability, although market turbulence, particularly in tech, and declining US equities could pose future challenges. Nonetheless, Baidu's focus on technological improvements seems to resonate positively with investors amid broader market uncertainty..Review our growth performance report to gain insights into Baidu's future..Diversify your portfolio with solid dividend payers offering reliable income streams to weather potential market turbulence..Over the last 5 years, Baidu achieved a total shareholder return of 2.85%. While the company's recent product launches have garnered attention, earlier developments also played significant roles in shaping its long-term performance. Baidu's consistent investment in AI was evidenced by events like the Baidu AI Developer Conference in April 2024 and Baidu World 2024, both displaying new AI models and tools. The dedication to expanding AI capabilities, including the Apollo Go autonomous driving initiative, underscored Baidu's tech-centric direction..Financially, Baidu's CNY 10 billion note offering in early 2025 hinted at reinforced fiscal stability, complementing its share buyback strategy, which saw nearly 4 million shares repurchased by February 2025. Despite these efforts, Baidu underperformed in the US Interactive Media and Services industry over the past year, where the broader industry outpaced it.

This shift comes as a downturn in U.S. equities has been attributed to President Trump's tariffs, which have been aimed at traditional trade allies such as Canada and Mexico, outside of adversaries like China..Boosting and providing an edge to Alibaba and Baidu, is there artificial intelligence expansion, which has gained steam and notoriety following the announcement of China-based DeepSeek’s advancement in AI at a more affordable cost.. .With DeepSeek being a private company, Alibaba has taken the show in public markets by unveiling its new AI reasoning model, QwQ-32B. Like Amazon AMZN, Alibaba’s AI expansion is another bid to boost its market dominance with both having diversified business endeavors outside of e-commerce.    .Similarly, Baidu has leveraged its AI efforts as the largest search engine provider in China, a step that Alphabet GOOGL is swiftly perusing in the U.S. Notably, Baidu will be launching an upgraded version of its AI assistant, “Ernie” this month, which is similar to Alphabet’s Google Gemini.  . .Echoing the swoon in investor sentiment from U.S. tech stocks to those of China, Alibaba stock has soared over +60% year to date with Baidu shares up a very respectable +12%. In comparison, Amazon and Alphabet shares have fallen 10% and 13%, respectively, with the broader indexes for U.S. markets in negative territory as well..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .In regards to their outlook, Alibaba’s top line is expected to rise 6% in fiscal 2025 and FY26 with projections edging toward $147 billion in annual sales. Furthermore, Alibaba’s annual earnings are currently slated to increase 2% this year and are projected to spike another 23% in FY26 to $10.83 per share. More intriguing, over the last 30 days, FY25 EPS estimates have risen 1% with FY26 EPS estimates up 6%.  .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .Pivoting to Baidu, total sales are slated to increase 1% in FY25 and are forecasted to rise another 4% next year to $19.52 billion. On the bottom line, Baidu’s EPS is expected to be down 9% in FY25 but is projected to rebound and jump 16% in FY26 to $11.17. In the last month, Alibaba’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are up 4%, respectively..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research. .Despite a very sharp YTD rally to around $140, Alibaba stock still trades at a reasonable 15X forward earnings multiple with Baidu shares at $94 and 9.6X.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) stands against the other cheap internet stocks to buy according to hedge funds..On March 6, Jan Kniffen, CEO of J Rogers Kniffen, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on retail. Weaving several threads of news in the retail space, he said that the fourth quarter was great despite an awful January and February due to the weather. However, the market is going to see a pickup in March as the calendar inches closer to Easter because even in the otherwise horrible month of February, the market saw a good Valentine’s Day..He believed that March would see a pickup because the consumer still feels healthy, even if they are nervous. Spending has been pretty good on everything other than weather-related items, but the traffic has been slow. Kniffen believed that this trend is weather-related as well. He said that he isn’t too concerned yet, but while the retail numbers today may not make one nervous, tomorrow’s numbers may have the opposite effect. According to Kniffen, retailers are only seeing a little weakness, and that’s all weather-related..READ ALSO: 12 Best Leisure Stocks to Buy Right Now and 12 Best Apparel Stocks to Invest In..Talking about the potential effects of tariffs on retailers, he was of the view that power and negotiating skills make up the necessary concoction to deal with the scenario. Companies with better logistics teams, experience with dealing with tariffs strategically, and a healthy position in terms of balance sheet are more likely to do well. Therefore, companies in the sector that are well-financed, boast great teams, and are executing flawlessly will do better than those struggling with dealing with tariffs. While Kniffen said that he couldn’t claim he isn’t worried about the tariffs, he isn’t terrified of them either, as the market knows how to deal with them..The real question he posed was whether all that the market gets is 10% to 20% in China or whether it would really get 25% in both Canada and Mexico. In the second case, the whole economy gets dislocated, the consumer gets nervous, and everyone is terrified that they will quit spending and the market may go into a consumer-led recession..However, if the tariffs were imposed only on China, the situation might be different. China has a significant export economy and would have to absorb a big chunk of the tariffs. It did so last time as well and is likely to do the same this time as well. The market will then also see substitution, trade down, and all the stuff we see when the consumer has to deal with it. The retail market will react to all that, and the big and strong members will likely react better.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-inc-bidu-cheap-internet-084927728.html,Market Risk Investment Risk Company Specific Risk

The company's latest earnings report showed a slight dip in revenue but an increase in net income and earnings per share compared to last year, potentially bolstering investor confidence. The share buyback update could also have been an attractive factor for investors. In contrast to Baidu's performance, major U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines due to market-wide concerns about tariffs and economic uncertainties. Against this backdrop, Baidu's positive movement in share price suggests a degree of investor confidence in the company's recent strategic maneuvers and financial health, despite general market downturns and declines in other tech giants’ stocks..Take a closer look at Baidu's potential here..Over the past five years, Baidu has achieved a total shareholder return of 5.71%. This period witnessed substantial developments, such as the ongoing execution of its share buyback program, announced in early 2023, which saw the repurchase of a cumulative 16,195,015 shares by Q4 2024, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing shareholder value. In early 2024, Baidu reported significant profit growth for 2023, with net income jumping to CNY 20.32 billion from CNY 7.56 billion the previous year. This growth likely bolstered investor sentiment despite fluctuating annual revenues..Despite these efforts, Baidu's performance in the past year lagged behind the US Interactive Media and Services industry and the broader market, as reflected by its underperformance relative to the industry's 25.9% return and the US market's 12.1% gain.

192,2025-03-10 16:06:00,Nasdaq Stock Correction: 4 Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Make for Slam-Dunk Buys Right Now,"Four historically cheap, well-diversified AI stocks are ripe for the picking -- and I'm not talking about Nvidia or Palantir Technologies.","Over the last two weeks, Wall Street has sent a stern reminder to the investment community that stocks can, indeed, move in both directions..Following an unwavering rally spanning almost two-and-a-half years, the growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) officially entered correction territory. As of the closing bell on March 6, the Nasdaq Composite sat 10% below its all-time closing high of 20,173.89, set on Dec. 16, 2024..The hardest-hit stocks over the last two weeks have generally been those that benefited the most during the current bull market rally. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken it on the chin..The excitement surrounding AI stocks is palpable. Based on estimates from PwC, empowering software and systems with AI gives this technology a $15.7 trillion global addressable market by the turn of the decade. This is a big enough pie that a large number of businesses can emerge as winners..But there's also the realization that every next-big-thing investment trend since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has undergone a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. All game-changing technologies need adequate time to mature, and the fact that most businesses lack an understanding of how to optimize their AI solutions denotes that this technology hasn't matured yet. It's why I believe market-leading AI stocks Nvidia and Palantir Technologies may not be the best way to invest in this space..Nevertheless, the Nasdaq stock correction has opened the door for opportunistic investors to pounce on four historically cheap, well-diversified, and all-around magnificent AI stocks..The first phenomenal AI stock that makes for a slam-dunk buy with the Nasdaq correcting lower is e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Although concerns about retail sales might weigh on Amazon stock in the very short-term, this is a company that generates the bulk of its growth and operating cash flow from its ancillary operations..Nothing is more important to its future than cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is aggressively incorporating generative AI solutions into its platform, which allows its clients to deploy custom AI applications and build large language models (LLMs). Sales growth at AWS has begun reaccelerating, with an annual revenue run-rate of $115 billion, as of the end of 2024. This high-margin segment typically generates more than half of Amazon's operating income despite accounting for just a sixth of the company's net sales.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-stock-correction-4-magnificent-080600220.html,"Market Risk, Investment Risk, Market Sentiment Risk"

But its virtually certain...,"As an investor its worth striving to ensure your overall portfolio beats the market average. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) shareholders, since the share price is down 20% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 40%. On the other hand the share price has bounced 9.7% over the last week..On a more encouraging note the company has added US$2.9b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the three-year loss for shareholders.. View our latest analysis for Baidu .While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)..Although the share price is down over three years, Baidu actually managed to grow EPS by 33% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past..It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price..Revenue is actually up 3.5% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Baidu more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity..The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail)..Baidu is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Baidu in this interactive graph of future profit estimates..Baidu shareholders are down 3.5% for the year, but the market itself is up 14%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.1% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Is Baidu cheap compared to other companies?

The bonds, set to mature in 2032, are linked to shares of Trip.com Group and structured to attract institutional investors through offshore transactions. With proceeds earmarked for debt repayment, interest payments, and general corporate use, this marks Baidu's second major capital-raising effort in recent weeksfollowing a $1.4 billion bond sale outside mainland China. The bonds will be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's Open Market, and major players like JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America are handling the deal..Warning!

Chinese tech stocks have been riding a wave of optimism, buoyed by Beijing's pledge to support AI and advanced manufacturing. But Baidu's stock hasn't quite kept paceup just 12.5% this year, far behind the Hang Seng Tech Index's 35% surge. The company is also contending with challenges in its core business, reporting a third straight quarterly revenue drop as competition in search and AI intensifies. Meanwhile, other Chinese giants are seizing the momentBYD (BYDDF) just pulled off a massive $5.6 billion share sale, the biggest in Hong Kong in nearly four years..For investors, the structure of Baidu's bonds adds another layer of intrigue. The exchangeable feature allows hedging strategies that could shake up Trip.com's stock in the short term.

Investors are looking overseas to China's terrific ten for gains. Now our finance is Julie Hyman joins now with a closer look in our chart of the day. .Yeah, we have definitely seen some of these Chinese big tech stocks outperform. This was pointed out in a tweet today and we took this chart and basically, you see the terrific 10, which is some of dubbed some of those large cap Chinese tech companies up this year by nearly 40%, even as we've seen the magnificent seven and green here slump a little bit, the S&P 500 and the QQQs. That's the ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100. I've also kind of flat lined here as we have seen this. It's not necessarily what you would expect in this sort of tariff and trade war environment. We talked earlier to Brandon Ahearn of Crane shares his Kweb ETF. The Crane shares runs has done quite well also and he talked about that. .But I really go back to January of 2024, and that's when the last China bull was slaughtered as you had this derivative induced meltdown in both China and Hong Kong. And since January of 2024, Kweb is up over 60%. It's actually up more than double both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, but it's so out of sight, out of mind for most investors. I don't think they recognize that. .Well, now this index and others like it are getting more attention and these collections of stocks, people are looking to Europe, people are looking to China. Now, as for the terrific 10, what goes into the terrific 10. Here's a list or and it's probably fluid to some extent. Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, JD, Netease, Baidu, Gili and Smec all on in that terrific 10, if you will, or tremendous 10, whatever you want to call it. When we talked to A, he attributed the gains to a couple of things. He said, first of all, China is in a stimulative environment and cycle right now. Now, that stimulus at various times that the government has offered has been disappointing to investors. They have wanted more, but some investors think they've now finally gotten to that critical mass or amount of stimulus coming into the market. The other thing that Brandon talked about that was quite interesting was that Deep Seek was really a milestone for China and evidence that there could be that AI, that homegrown AI innovation without a reliance on the US. Although, as we know, there are some questions about how many US advanced chips were perhaps used to fuel the Deep Seek model. Nonetheless, the numbers tell the story, Josh, and they're up. .Sure do. .Thank you, Julie.
