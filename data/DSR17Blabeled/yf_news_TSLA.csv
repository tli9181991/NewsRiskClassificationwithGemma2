For more, I want to bring in now Dave Mozza, chief executive officer at Round Hill Investments. Dave, it's great to see you. Let let's start there with Nvidia, Dave. Uh it's a name you know well. What do you make of the move off the April low we have seen there, Dave, and what do you see ahead for Jensen Huang's company? .Yeah, look, Nvidia is showing its leadership uh through this market rally. And one of the reasons being is like there's a lot of resiliency with the AI trade. I think obviously the deep seek news which happened before the liberation day sell off, you know, brought a lot of skittishness to investors on on sort of the durability of that trade and actually more so the durability for companies like Nvidia to continue to power through that. Um but what we've seen is Nvidia is actually navigated well this environment. Certainly questions about that China market share that they're likely going to continue to lose. But now with the introduction of sovereign AI deals, I think Nvidia is showing that they have a lot more going for it than just sort of relying on what they've been doing with data centers and the hyperscalars in the US and even even a country as important or a market is important to it as like China. .I also, Dave, I want to talk about this new ETF of yours which includes Nvidia and the focus is humanoid robots, Dave. And listen, robots we know, you know, it's not a new investing theme. It's been around for some time. So so why why launch this product now, Dave? .Yeah, so it's interesting. Nvidia is actually the second largest holding uh in the portfolio. Not that they're making robots, but actually their Jets and AI uh is incredibly important uh for the growth of humanoid robotics. But to answer your point specifically on the why now is that we're seeing a convergence of trends um that are really we believe going to benefit robots, but particularly humanoid robotics. And one is this ongoing labor shortage, particularly for uh what are called the 3Ds of work. Um so that's dull work, that's dirty work, and dangerous work. Um so these this is work. Um dull work is repetitive work stocking shelves. We know that a humanoid robot can can do work of that nature. Of course dangerous work, um having a a robot do that as opposed to a human can be beneficial. Um and then dirty work, cleaning sludge and things of that nature. Um and so because of the power of AI, the computational capabilities plus the cost of those capabilities coming down, now's really the time that we're seeing sort of the potential for explosion of of humanoid robots. And also this idea of embedded intelligence embedded AI uh is coming and it's happening now with humanoid robotics. So we really think this is the next wave of AI growth.

Finance's market minute. US stocks are pushing higher today, within points of its record high, as the S&P 500 sees its record rally continue. Meanwhile, a high profile departure at Tesla. According to Bloomberg, the executive who oversaw sales and manufacturing operations for North America and Europe has left the company. He was promoted to the role just last year and is one of Elon Musk's closest confidants at Tesla. Forbes is also reporting that the executive was fired. North America and Europe have become pain points for the automaker recently with sales plunging due to rising competition and consumer backlash to Musk and the White House. Plus, Micron shares falling today despite the company posting strong results, driven by AI computing demand. Analysts also see the company benefiting from improved demand for its more mature chips. The company also seeing its price targets boosted by several analysts following the results. And Novo Nordisk adding a deal with Weight Watchers to boost access to its Wegovy drug, just days after acting a collaboration with telehealth company Hims & Hers. And that's your Yahoo!

Yahoo finances price of Meranian joins us now with more prize. .Tesla European sales down for the ACA uh trade group in May to about 13,800 units. That's down 27.9% compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, overall sales in the region were up 25% in Europe. And this despite the new Model Y being available. So, what's going on here, Josh? It's kind of more of the same that we've been talking about. There's the must factor, the must factor alienating buyers with his support of far right-wing figures. And of course, there's better competition from Chinese makes like BYD, SAIC, as well as Volkswagen, right, the legacy automakers. So, same story in Europe, demand evaporating. Big question is, will it ever recover? .Prize with the headlines. Let's bring back in our expert contributor, now Fundstrat Global Advisors, Mark Newton to discuss some recent moves with Tesla. You look at the technicals on this one, Mark, what do you see? .It's encouraging. The stock's been up 15% over the last three months. I mean, obviously it's had a tough first half of the year. Always discouraging when a stock becomes uh more political, but honestly, you know, Tesla's back half of the year is shaping up to be very, very good. I mean, they had a great first weekend with this uh robo taxi rollout. We know that the combination of both FSD and self-autonomous both could account for potentially a trillion dollars in the next five years. Uh and a lot of that is not being shown right now in the current data. So it is sort of a show me stock. Elon always over promises and to some extent has under delivered, but yet uh the stock is is something that is very promising for me. Uh I like the stock a lot. I think getting back above 349 would put it back towards uh new all-time highs. And so I I'm uh, you know, bullish. My cycle projections show the stock continuing to rise in the back half of the year, much different than the first part of the year. So I like it. .Prize, let me ask you just back to fundamentals there. When you think about competition for Tesla in Europe, where is that primarily coming from, Prize? I mean, is it China, domestic, you know, European players, both? .Yeah, you know, you saw you see some upside uh some upside sales here for for BMW, right? And also, Volkswagen, I mentioned a lot of new smaller models coming out that are playing in spaces that Tesla isn't operating. Same with the Chinese auto makers, they're not operating that that that that sort of cheaper market, the sub 25,000, 30,000 euro market where those other players are operating. Now we Tesla's long been saying that they are going to come out with this cheaper EV. Uh they've been saying that now for the past year. We haven't seen it yet. We're all kind of anxiously waiting to see what it is. What is it? Is going to be a smaller car? Is it going to be like a D content Model Y? We'll see, but what Mark was saying is absolutely right because uh tell about technicals too. The stock is totally divorced from fundamentals, right? We talk about poor European sales, stock down a bit, but it's been up a lot recently. Uh the stock is a momentum stock, right, Mark? And I think that uh as you see in second half of the year, seasonality seasonality wise, that stock tends to do better. .Yeah, absolutely right. Look, you look at the first part of the year, a lot of these sales are from time when when Elon was still affiliated with administration. And so it might not account for the current day. It's more of what happened in in recent history. And I think that sentiment uh should start to change in my view going forward. .All right, thank you, Prize. And a big thank you, of course to Mark Newton for hanging us with this this afternoon. Some final thoughts, Mark. .Nasdaq 100 at new all-time highs. I think Nvidia at new time highs. Uh S&P will get there sooner than later at a time when breadth is slowly but surely starting to expand. That's a good sign at a time when the economy seems to be working, earnings are good, and geopolitical risks are easing. So, investors don't seem to be all in on stocks by a long shot. People are still concerned for the right reasons. That's generally a time you still want to stick with the trend with markets at new highs. .Not so much a technical question for you, but a question for a guy who's watched the markets for a long time. You go back to early April to liberation day, right? Sky is falling, run for the hills. What do you just make of the move here? Are you surprised by how fast and hard we've come back? .I look at sentiment, I look at cycles. I think they're more important for me in determining where prices can go rather than Fed speak or earnings or any of those. So, you know, there was classic signs of capitulation that happened at the April lows. Um and I put out a report actually in April that said stocks are close to bottoming. I I am surprised of course that we're back at new all-time highs. You can see a bounce, but the fact that tech carried through as quickly as it did uh very, very encouraging. For my great great grandfather, Isaac Newton, you don't ever want to fight trends. Never things that are accelerating cannot be moved without sufficient force. So, like technically, things are in great shape and and sentiment has been a key reason why investors want to stick on board and and try to divorce themselves from what's happening in the world and just concentrate on their portfolios. .When you call that bottom, did you get any push back from clients on that? .Uh I got a lot of pushback, of course. I mean, I think that people uh think you're you're crazy when when we see markets selling off to the extent they did specifically in late March. I happen to be in in Latin America and so trying to write reports while being in Medellin and and Lima, it's not fun to have to go back and address the volatility and people look at you a little funny. So, uh happy that things worked out and and you know, it's encouraging to see both Tom Lee and myself have been, you know, optimistic and and saw reasons as to why stocks should have bottomed and pushed higher. Uh and still reasons for optimism, you know, I think in in the back half of this year, even if we get a bumpy fall. So, um happy for the recovery. .Mark, great to have you on Saturday. Thank you, sir. Good to have you. .Thank you. Great to be here. Thanks. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-next-tesla-european-demand-220629661.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Since then, the company has evolved into a diversified powerhouse spanning electric vehicles, energy storage, mobile components, solar cells, and even monorails..Its vertically integrated structure has enabled smoother global expansion than many legacy automakers, which juggle EVs and traditional vehicles. In 2024, BYD posted impressive results, with revenue surging 29% to ¥777.1 billion and profits climbing 34% year-over-year..The balance sheet appears exceptional, with solid cash reserves that comfortably outweigh debts of ¥29.13 billion and a declining debt-to-asset ratio in recent quarters, as shown by TipRanks data. Notably, this is unlike many traditional automakers who are struggling to pivot as consumer demands and markets transition towards electric vehicles..In the rapidly evolving EV space, technological leadership is a clear differentiator, and BYD’s Blade Battery is a standout. This lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery is praised for its superior safety, longevity, and cost efficiency. Its enhanced resistance to thermal runaway, improved energy density, and lower production costs give BYD a significant edge over traditional battery designs..From an investor’s perspective, this innovation translates into more competitively priced vehicles without compromising on safety or performance, key factors for converting hesitant consumers..Beyond the battery, BYD is also making strides in EV infrastructure. Its latest ultra-fast charging platform, capable of adding 400 km of range in just five minutes, directly addresses one of the biggest consumer concerns: range anxiety.

Afshar, Musk, and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Afshar’s departure was first reported by Bloomberg News..As recently as Tuesday, Afshar was posting support for the limited rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. “Absolutely historic day for Tesla,” he wrote on June 23 on X, the social media platform his former boss owns. “Thank you, Elon, for pushing us all!”.His departure comes at a time when the company’s sales growth has vanished. Tesla sold fewer cars in 2024 than it did in 2023, the first annual drop since it started mass-producing EVs more than a decade ago..Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics has not helped, despite his recent pledge that he was leaving the Trump administration. Sales continued to struggle through the first half of 2025. The company’s industry-leading profits fell 71% year-over-year in the first quarter. European sales fell nearly 28% percent year-over-year in May. Tesla will report global delivery figures for the second quarter next week, and financial results for the period in mid-July..Afshar was not a particularly public-facing executive at Tesla. He joined the company in 2017 and spent years working in the “office of the CEO.” He took on increasing responsibilities ever since; Musk has previously credited Afshar with leading the construction of Tesla’s massive factory in Austin, Texas..Not long after that, though, Afshar found himself in hot water. In 2022 he became the subject of an internal probe after he was allegedly involved in a plan to purchase special material for a glass building Musk reportedly wanted. Both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating those purchases in 2023..During some of that time period, Afshar moved over to SpaceX and reportedly was involved with X for a while.

Power: Fewer Physical Vehicle Controls and More Problematic Touchscreen Make Infotainment System a Modern ""Catch-All Drawer.""","Lexus Ranks Highest Overall in Initial Quality; Nissan Ranks Highest among Mass Market Brands.TROY, Mich., June 26, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Despite the growing complexity of today’s new vehicles, the number of problems cited by owners in the first 90 days of ownership has improved slightly, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Initial Quality Study (IQS),SM released today. Overall, problems per 100 vehicles (PP100) have improved to 192 PP100 from 194 PP100 a year ago. Premium brands have improved 27 PP100 to 203 PP100 from 230 PP100 in 2024, largely driven by Tesla, while problems among mass market brands have increased to 187 PP100 from 181 PP100 in 2024. A lower score reflects higher vehicle quality..The infotainment category improves 1.9 PP100 yet remains the most problematic vehicle category in the study (42.6 PP100). While half of the top problems industry-wide remain infotainment issues, 11 infotainment problems show improvement from a year ago. However, owners are having more touchscreen-related problems due to the inclusion of non-audio-related features like climate controls, garage door openers and even glove box releases..""While customers do find the larger touchscreens visually appealing, their functionality within the vehicle is an increasing source of frustration,"" said Frank Hanley, senior director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power. ""Customers are having to tap and swipe through multiple screens to access key vehicle functions like climate settings and built-in garage door openers. Owners find these things to be overly complicated and too distracting to use while driving. By retaining dedicated physical controls for some of these interactions, automakers can alleviate pain points and simplify the overall customer experience."".Following are some key findings of the 2025 study:.Premium vehicles have more defects than mass market counterparts: While design-related issues are equal between mass market and premium vehicles, defect/malfunction-related issues are more prevalent on premium vehicles. Exterior is the largest area of discrepancy, with premium vehicles averaging 4.2 more problems than mass market vehicles, mostly driven by those from non-traditional automakers..Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have most problems: For the first time, PHEVs, on average, have more problems than their battery electric vehicle (BEV) counterparts (237 PP100 vs. 212 PP100, respectively). Gasoline (184 PP100) and hybrid (196 PP100) vehicles have fewer problems than PHEVs and BEVs. The improvement in BEVs is driven by a 62 PP100 improvement for Tesla..Problematic launches and late model-year changeovers: New-model launches account for the highest number of problems (203 PP100) since the study was redesigned in 2020, compared with 190 PP100 for carryover models. Of the 18 new models launched this year, only two have fewer problems than their respective segment average. ""Typically, problems for new launches are balanced with some being successful and others having issues,"" Hanley said. ""This year, however, new launches are notably more problematic."" The good news for the new launches is that they require fewer repair visits than the carryover models..Shifting consumer preferences increase cupholder frustration: While it seemed like manufacturers had cupholders figured out, given that owners are now bringing more reusable containers into their vehicles, manufacturers are struggling to keep up with being able to accommodate all the different shapes and sizes that are increasingly available. Consequently, owners are again citing more problems in this area, with the expectation that their vehicle should be able to hold different sizes of containers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fewer-physical-vehicle-controls-more-160000071.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

2025-06-27 00:18:00,There Are Currently Better Options Than Microsoft,The reason other Mag-7 stocks are more attractive at the moment.,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies, belonging to the mag-7 and being the biggest company in the world according to market capitalization. While MSFT is definitely a great company, this article will show why it currently is not a buy for me, mainly because there are better deals in other mag-7 companies at lower valuations and better fundamentals..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT..From a fundamental perspective, Microsoft is a strong company, with a gross profit margin of 69.7% and an EBITDA margin of 55.25%, far above the industry medians of 50.78% and 10.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the ROE is great at 33.61%, while the industry median is only at 4.96%..The same can also be said for growth. While MSFT is not as far ahead of other companies as it was in terms of profitability, a revenue growth rate of 14.13% and an EBITDA growth rate of 19.16% are still great. Furthermore, forward growth rates are even stronger than current ones, suggesting a positive outlook. Only ROE growth is a weak point in this sector, with both current and forward ROE growth expected to be negative..As with all Mag-7 companies, valuation is the biggest problem for Microsoft. Everyone already knows that we are talking about a great company, so the most important thing to get right is to find a good entrance price. Currently, the EV/EBITDA ratio of the stock is relatively high at 22.8, a 31% premium to the industry median. Moreover, the P/S and P/B ratios are even more elevated at 12.51 and 10.49, suggesting a 311% and 214% premium, respectively. The P/E ratio at 35.11 is also very high at the moment. Figure 1 shows the historical P/E ratio of MSFT as can be seen, the company currently trades at 2020 and 2023 levels, leaving it at a higher bound of its average valuation..When comparing Microsoft's user base to that of other Mag-7 companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), one can instantly see that the company's valuation is elevated. At around 1.5 billion users and a market cap of 3.35T, the company has a valuation of $2.233 per user. At the same time, GOOG and META only have valuations of $820 and $494 per user, respectively, making them much cheaper in comparison. Additionally, ROE is a weak point too, with only Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) being worse at 8.79% and 25.24%, respectively..From a growth perspective, Microsoft is solid but does not particularly stand out at slightly better revenue growth but significantly less EBITDA growth than Alphabet. Furthermore, the negative ROE growth is the second worst in the peer group, with only Tesla's ROE falling by almost 70%. In total, Microsoft seems fundamentally somewhere around the average, with profitability being a strength while growth is a comparative weakness.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currently-better-options-microsoft-093720326.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It has gained about 23%, becoming the best-performing ETF of the month..Most of the rally came from the explosive moves in a few stock holdings of ARKK. Circle CRCL soared nearly 750% from its June 5 IPO, powered by U.S. Senate passage of the GENIUS Act, which formalizes stablecoin regulation. The stock accounts for a 5.2% share in the ARKK portfolio.Coinbase COIN jumped nearly 30% mid-June after announcing plans to launch its own stablecoin, boosting crypto optimism. The stock occupies the second position in the ETF portfolio, accounting for 9.6% of the assets. Meanwhile, Roblox RBLX, which makes up for 7% share in the ARKK basket, rallied 8.8% on strong first-quarter results.  Tesla TSLA, ARKK's largest holding with a 9.9% share, has been riding high in June, fueled by excitement around autonomous driving and robotaxi development. The electric carmaker launched its long-anticipated driverless robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, sending its shares up as much as 10% on June 23. Despite some recent profit-taking, ARK maintained conviction in Tesla's position (read: Capitalize on Tesla's Robotaxi Momentum With These ETFs).Enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence also pushed Palantir Technologies PLTR shares to new records last week. The stock has risen 8.4% so far this month. PLTR has a 4.4% share in the ARKK basket..Cathie Wood, the high-profile CEO of Ark Investment Management, remains especially bullish on the transformative power of emerging technologies. ""During the current turbulent transition in the United States, she believes consumers and businesses will accelerate the shift toward innovation platforms, including artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and multiomics sequencing.”ARKK added shares in NVIDIA NVDA and BWX Technologies BWXT to ride AI and nuclear tailwinds. The purchase of more than 128,000 shares of NVDA, worth roughly $18.5 million, came on the heels of bullish guidance from its CEO, Jensen Huang, particularly around quantum computing and a pivot away from China in response to escalating export restrictions. The move reflects ARKK’s commitment to next-generation computing, even amid rising geopolitical uncertainty.ARKK purchased more than $30 million worth of BWXT, reflecting Wood’s deepening bet on nuclear energy. The timing coincides with favorable legislative tailwinds in the United States, as nuclear energy emerges as one of the few politically viable clean energy options (read: ARK ETFs Surged Last Week: Here's Why). Known for backing high-growth tech stocks even in volatile times, Wood expanded its stake in Advanced Micro Devices AMD last week, acquiring 247,753 shares valued at approximately $31.4 million across three ETFs. The purchase was distributed among ARKK, ARK Next Generation Internet ARKW and ARK Fintech Innovation ARKF ETFs, underscoring ARK’s ongoing conviction in AI and semiconductor stocks.

Shares extended that gain in early trading Thursday, rising as much as 3.7%, on track for a record close..Palantir, which makes software used by governments and corporations to analyze large volumes of data, is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year amid excitement about its artificial intelligence products and signs that it’s winning more business from the Trump administration.

Per BloombergNEF, global electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to hit nearly 22 million this year, a sharp 25% jump from last year. One in every four cars sold this year will be either fully electric or a plug-in hybrid. And a big part of this boom is happening in China, which is expected to account for nearly two-thirds of all EV sales. Europe and the United States are also playing catch-up, with a growing number of affordable models being rolled out and battery prices continuing to fall..Not too long ago, when people talked about EVs, Tesla TSLA was the only name that came to mind. It was the clear leader, making EVs cool, functional and mainstream. But the landscape is changing fast. Legacy automakers like General Motors GM are now pushing hard into the EV space. Startups like Lucid Group LCID are attracting attention with fresh designs and new tech. And Chinese companies like BYD Co Ltd BYDDY are charging ahead with big product lineups and global ambitions. Climate concerns, stricter emission standards and big improvements in battery range and charging speeds are making EVs more practical—and more popular..Meanwhile, the autonomous vehicle (AV) market is also shifting gears. Future Market Insights projects that the AV market will grow from about $36 billion in 2025 to more than $83 billion by 2035. That’s an 8.7% CAGR, driven by smarter sensors, better connectivity and rising demand for safer, self-driving transport. AV tech is maturing fast, and the companies leading the charge in software, chips, and robotics are worth watching..Whether you’re excited about the rise of cleaner, greener cars—or the possibility of never having to drive one again—this space is full of innovation. And for investors, it might just be one of the most electrifying corners of the market to explore right now.

It surpassed Tesla in 2024 to become the world's largest EV manufacturer by sales, and the automaker isn't pumping the brakes..For BYD's next magic trick, it's about to make a big push into Europe. But is this a bad time with consumer sentiment there for EVs in decline?.BYD's efforts in Europe got off to a bit of a sputtering start before it adjusted its sales strategy to focus on more affordable models. That pivot helped it gain traction in key European markets. In April, BYD sold more EVs in Europe than Tesla for the first time, according to a report by JATO Dynamics. Its move into the lead was aided both by Tesla's aging vehicle lineup and by the political adventures of CEO Elon Musk, which turned some consumers off the Tesla brand..Surpassing Tesla in Europe was a huge accomplishment considering it has led the Continent's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) market for years while BYD only officially began its operations there in late 2022. In fact, despite a slow start, BYD nearly quadrupled European sales during the first four months of 2025, per data from market research firm Dataforce. BYD is increasing its sales by roughly 10% monthly in Europe right now -- a staggering rate of growth..""If you are winning here, it means you are super good in every angle,"" said BYD Executive Vice President Stella Li in an interview with Bloomberg News. She also said the automaker would spend up to $20 billion in the region, noting that ""Europe is our most important market."".BYD's strategy includes rolling out an ultra-fast charging network across Europe to help drive brand awareness, build market share, and encourage broader consumer confidence in the availability of charging infrastructure. The company's system will be capable of recharging a BYD vehicle for 250 miles to 292 miles of range in as little as five minutes, depending on a few factors..It also recently launched a new model in Europe that has the potential to be its hottest seller there yet: the Dolphin Surf, a variant of BYD's best-selling EV, the Seagull. The compact vehicle sells for under $10,000 in China and will start at 19,990 euros ($22,700), drastically undercutting other top-selling EVs in the market.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-byd-next-ambitious-110000369.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The remainder is owned by minority shareholders, including Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and US private equity firm TPG..The decision to list in London offers a glimmer of hope for the UK’s primary markets, which have seen a sharp decline in new IPO activity..In 2023, 88 companies either delisted from the London Stock Exchange’s main market or shifted their primary listing elsewhere, mainly to New York.

Now valued at $187 billion, Xiaomi is worth more than Chinese EV leader BYD Co. as it grows its footprint in the world’s largest car market..The new YU7, a direct competitor to Tesla Inc.’s Model Y, may help it accomplish that goal. The SUV is a hallmark of Xiaomi’s $10 billion EV strategy as larger vehicles gain popularity across China. It also signifies a deeper shift in Xiaomi’s business model, offering consumers the ability to sync key aspects of their daily lives. That combined ecosystem is what some investors are saying will cement its place as a leader in China’s trillion-dollar tech sector..The new offering “not only gives Xiaomi business exposure in the fast growing EV business in China, but more importantly the synergy,” said June Lui, a portfolio manager at Polen Capital. “Globally, there is no one company that can connect your mobile device, your home appliances and your car — and they have all three.”.Over the past 12 months, Xiaomi’s shares have more than tripled, topping a gauge of peers as it leverages its smartphone success into China’s crowded EV market..The rally, which stands out even amid the renaissance in China tech thanks to DeepSeek’s breakthrough, has made Xiaomi one of the country’s most expensive tech stocks. Shares are now trading at nearly 30 times forward earnings, almost double the valuation of Tencent Holdings Ltd. (TCTZF) and even above US giant Apple Inc. (AAPL)..Still, overwhelmingly bullish sell-side analysts hope its sportier and more premium second EV will help Xiaomi capture a new customer segment and drive the stock even higher. Order momentum for the YU7 is also key for boosting production scale, which is critical for improving unit economics in the auto business..Pricing estimates by analysts for the YU7 range from 250,000 yuan ($34,900) to 330,000 yuan. In comparison, Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y starts from 263,500 yuan while the electric version of BYD's (BYDDY, BYDDF) Tang L SUV, which is just slightly smaller than the YU7, sells for between 239,800 and 289,800 yuan.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-xiaomi-launch-first-suv-220000720.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Wall Street has steadily trimmed its Q2 delivery estimate to around 390,000 vehicles, down sharply from 502,000 at the start of 2025. Yet, despite the weakening fundamentals, Tesla shares remain up 27% since its disappointing Q1 delivery report on April 2..The reason? Robo-taxis.

Wedbush analyst Dan Iveswho rode twicecalled the experience comfortable, safe, and personalized, and reaffirmed his Street-high $500 target. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney took a more cautious stance, noting the presence of a Tesla employee in the car and warning that scaling could take time.

2025-06-26 02:00:00,Tariffs Will Hit These Car Brands the Hardest,"A projected 25% tariff on imported vehicles will significantly impact US car prices, with the effect varying widely among different brands.","Tariffs on imported goods can have a wide ripple effect on prices, especially in the auto industry where supply chains are global, complex, and highly sensitive to cost changes..In this graphic, Visual Capitalist's Marcus Lu reveals how tariffs will impact U.S. car prices, assuming a flat 25% tariff is applied onto vehicles imported from outside North America..For models assembled within North America, the projections represent a 25% tariff on a model’s non-U.S. content and up to a 15% tariff discount of the total MSRP. Visit the official White House fact sheet to learn more..The analysis shows that Tesla, Jeep, and Honda will be the least affected by Trump’s auto tariffs, while Buick, Hyundai, and Kia will face the steepest price hikes..Although Buick is an American brand, the company produces many of its models in China and South Korea. As a result, Buick tops this list with a 22% projected price increase—the highest among all brands surveyed..This underscores how globalization has changed the footprint of even legacy U.S. nameplates. In fact, Buick is so big in China it has its own sub-brand..Other vulnerable brands are Hyundai and Kia, each projected to see a 21–22% increase in vehicle prices. Though both brands have some manufacturing presence in the U.S., a significant portion of their models and components are still imported from South Korea..In late 2024, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America opened in Georgia, which the company will use to build its U.S.-sold electric vehicles.

TSLA rolled out robotaxi services in Austin, TX, last weekend. The company launched the services with 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles. It came installed with Tesla’s newest driverless technology and a human valet in the front passenger seat. The debut was limited to invited users and set to operate during daylight hours and only in good weather..But the debut was not without hiccups. Videos shared online show that vehicles soared beyond the speed limit, took wrong turns, entered the incorrect lane and came to a halt abruptly. Such sights escalate the risk of fatal accidents and damage the overall trustworthiness of Tesla as a brand. Various instances of traffic rule breaches caught the attention of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). The regulators contacted the automakers, initiating a probe into this matter. The traffic safety agency has acknowledged the incidents that surfaced and is moving forward with the formal investigation..Tesla stock initially surged 8% on Monday following the launch, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its self-driving ambitions. However, shares pulled back roughly 2% yesterday as safety questions emerged..The U.S law does not require NHTSA to pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems. Rather, the responsibility lies with the manufacturers to judge and accordingly certify whether each vehicle meets NHTSA’s rigorous safety standards. While concerns loom, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seen to celebrate the “successful” launch. However, NHTSA is yet to make comments on the performance of the vehicle, especially in times of limited visibility due to glare, dust or fog..Tesla, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Tesla, Inc.

2025-06-25 22:00:00,Nascent Materials emerges from stealth to make LFP batteries better and cheaper,"Nascent raised $2.3 million to develop its novel manufacturing process, which uses less energy and creates material that can be packed more tightly, improving energy density.","Lithium-ion batteries have dropped in cost by 75% over the past decade, a marvel of research and development that isn’t the result of a singular breakthrough but of myriad incremental improvements..Few know that better than Chaitanya Sharma, founder of the stealthy Nascent Materials. Sharma spent a little over two years working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada and another two leading iM3NY, a lithium-ion manufacturer in New York..Since leaving iM3NY in November 2023, he’s been working on a new way to process cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries — one of those small improvements that promises to continue driving down costs. Nascent’s new process could improve energy density of the cathode by up to 12% while costing 30% less to make..“In my mind, developing a new exotic chemistry is not really the way that I want to go,” Sharma told TechCrunch. “I want to develop new ways of making material.”.Sharma’s manufacturing-focused approach has attracted early investment. Nascent recently raised $2.3 million in a seed round led by SOSV, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund and UM6P Ventures also participated..The startup’s initial focus is on making lithium-ion-phosphate (LFP) and lithium-manganese-iron-phosphate, (LMFP), two cathode materials that have gained favor among automakers and data center operators. Recent improvements have brought LFP energy density closer to higher-end nickel- and cobalt-based chemistries but at much lower costs..But there’s still room for improvement. Sharma said that obtaining materials with consistent quality was a challenge at iM3NY, one that contributed to the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in January..The problem stems from supply chain inequities. Large players like Tesla’s Gigafactory, which it operates in partnership with Panasonic, tend to get more consistent material, Sharma said. “The small players, which, by the way, spend $100 million to $200 million on their factories as well, they get the outlier material.”.“That really became the reason why I wanted to launch Nascent Materials — because I want to make sure that I provide consistent materials to all customers,” Sharma said..Cathode material tends to come in powders, and while it might look consistent to the naked eye, slight variations in the grains can have an outsized impact on the final result. Sharma said Nascent has developed a process that uses less energy while also promising to create particles that are more consistently sized and shaped. That allows the material to be packed more tightly, improving energy density.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nascent-materials-emerges-stealth-lfp-140000960.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
2025-06-25 21:57:00,Can Rivian Weather Falling Deliveries Amid Demand Uncertainty?,RIVN slashes 2025 delivery outlook amid high uncertainty around consumer demand for high-priced vehicles.,"Rivian RIVN delivered 8,640 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, down from the 13,588 units delivered during the same period in the previous year. This drop was primarily attributed to higher-than-usual deliveries of Electric Delivery Vans (“EDV”) in the fourth quarter of 2024, which led to reduced volumes in the first quarter of 2025.The automaker produced 14,611 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, IL, in the first quarter, up from 13,980 vehicles produced in the same period last year. The company built more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter to make up for lost production later this year, since the factory will shut down for about a month to prepare for the R2 production. Most of these extra vehicles are not affected by tariffs, so the company plans to sell them in the coming quarters.Despite having sufficient in-hand inventory, Rivian's future deliveries are likely to be impacted by several external factors, including shifting government policies, macroeconomic conditions and trade-related supply-chain challenges. Elevated uncertainty around consumer sentiment, particularly regarding demand for high-priced vehicles, also clouds Rivian’s outlook. With an average selling price of $88,500 across its R1 models and commercial vans in the first quarter, Rivian’s premium product positioning inherently limits the addressable market, especially in the current economic climate. As a result of these challenges, Rivian revised its 2025 delivery guidance downward to a range of 40,000-46,000 vehicles compared with the earlier forecast of 46,000 to 51,000..In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla TSLA delivered 336,681 vehicles, comprising 323,800 Model 3/Y units and 12,881 from other models. Deliveries declined from 386,810 units reported in the year-ago quarter due to production pauses for Model Y retooling. Tesla plans to begin delivering the Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck in Saudi Arabia later this year, which will be the Cybertruck’s first launch outside North America.Lucid LCID delivered 3,109 vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a rise of 58.1% compared with the same period in 2024. In April, Lucid introduced the Lucid Gravity, a full-size three-row SUV designed to combine practicality with high-end sophistication. The 2026 Lucid Gravity Grand Touring variant is priced starting at $94,900 and currently available for order. The Lucid Gravity Touring version, with a starting price of $79,900, is scheduled for release later in 2025.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-weather-falling-deliveries-amid-135700022.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

While cars represent Tesla's primary product today, the company has a vision to become an artificial intelligence (AI) empire..The most direct way that Tesla is deploying AI is through the introduction of autonomous vehicles. Tesla is seeking to create a fleet of self-driving cars, known as the robotaxi, that can be hailed by consumers -- similar to applications such as Uber or Lyft. While this is an exciting initiative, Tesla has another AI project that receives little attention: humanoid robotics..Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that humanoid robotics could be a ""multitrillion-dollar industry."" Furthermore, Huang specifically referenced the Tesla Optimus as one of the leading robotics businesses that excites him..Let's explore the different ways that Optimus might help Tesla. In addition, I'll analyze recent price action in Tesla stock to assess if now is a good time to buy the stock..On the surface, the idea of humanoid robots might sound like something out of a science fiction novel. However, what investors may not realize is that Tesla is far from the only company exploring the intersection of robotics and AI..When it comes to humanoid bots specifically, one of the more prominent start-ups is Figure AI -- which attracted a number of high-profile investors, including Nvidia..The video above demonstrates an example of how Figure AI plans to deploy its robots in labor-intensive environments , such as factories.

Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), meanwhile, hasn't received a lot of press recently, but when you look under the hood, there are several major reasons to get excited..There's one catalyst that few investors are paying attention to right now that could add huge fuel to the stock price in early 2026. That makes now the time to buy for investors looking to stay ahead of the curve..When it comes to sales growth, it's been a tough couple of years for Rivian. The company's sales base today isn't much higher than it was at the end of 2023 due to several factors..Sales of electric vehicles industrywide has been below expectations, and weak consumer confidence has keep interest muted for the company's two luxury vehicles -- the R1T and R1S -- both of which can cost upwards of $100,000, depending on options. Those vehicles were also first released in 2021, adding staleness to the company's vehicle lineup..Fortunately, a big change is expected in 2026. This year, analysts predict annual sales growth of just 5.3%. In 2026, however, sales growth is expected to pick up to 40.5%..What's the cause? One factor: The release of new, affordable models..After years of development, Rivian is expected to begin releasing the first of three new models next year. The R2 will come first, with an expected price of under $50,000. The R3 is expected to follow as an even cheaper model..The R3X, meanwhile, is a high-performance version of the R3. While its details are unknown, the starting price is also expected to be below the $50,000 mark. That's critical, considering a majority of prospective electric-vehicle (EV) buyers are looking to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase..Without these newer, more affordable models, Rivian wouldn't be a viable option. The two vehicles currently in its lineup are simply too expensive..However, with the company's fresher lineup and more affordable options, analysts are very bullish on sales growth next year. But there's another surprising factor that should positively impact Rivian's financials even before these vehicles hit the road..In recent quarters, Rivian has attained positive gross margins for the first time in company history. This feat is a huge vote of confidence for the company's long term financial sustainability.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-surprising-reason-rivian-stock-101800138.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

One of the best-positioned in the domestic market at this time is Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN). Let's consider which stock has a better chance of outperforming the other in the coming years..When it comes to the EV market, Tesla has not been fairing well lately. While some of this can be attributed to increased competition in the pure EV space and the rising popularity of hybrid vehicles, much of Tesla's recent sales slump can be laid directly at the feet of CEO Elon Musk. His foray into politics as a major donor to President Donald Trump's campaign and his leadership role at the head of Trump's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) angered many liberals, leading to protests and boycotts of Tesla vehicles. More recently, he got into a major spat with Trump that may have alienated him from consumers on the other side of the political spectrum as well..Right now, the most recent publicly available Tesla sales data is from April, which was before Musk's fight with Trump. The company's sales sank by 16% in the U.S. and plunged by 50% in Europe. Meanwhile, its sales in China dropped by 9%, even as the company offered bigger incentives and discounts in the country than it had in the past and introduced its Model Y vehicle in that market..With Tesla sales reeling in all of its primary markets, it is pinning its hopes on its robotaxi business. The company just launched the service for paying riders in Austin, Texas. It's a small pilot program so far -- the rides are only taking place within a geofenced area, use of the service is by invitation only, and the vehicles -- all of the Model Ys, not CyberCabs -- are operating for now with a safety monitor in the passenger seat..Footage has already surfaced of one of those robotaxis driving briefly in a lane designated for traffic going in the opposite direction, among other reports of them violating traffic laws, so questions remain about Tesla's autonomous driving technology. Additionally, there is still the issue of whether the brand damage that Musk has caused will lead to potential customers shunning his robotaxi business, as well.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-rivian-vs-084000735.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Powell suggested that the central bank would not rush to make further rate changes, noting that ""as long as the economy is strong, and the uncertainty is high surrounding the still-unresolved tariff debate,"" there was no immediate need for action..He added that the Fed would closely monitor the ""impact of tariffs on inflation during June and July"" and indicated that ""interest rate cuts would come sooner if the central bank sees the tariff-driven inflation not as strong as expected."".Despite Powell's comments, the dollar struggled to regain momentum, leaving the pound to retain its strength against the greenback for now..In other currency moves, the pound was higher against the euro, up 0.2% to €1.1738 at the time of writing..The Eurostar is facing delays and cancellations today after a cable theft disrupted operations..The company has warned that the incident near Lille, in France, means its trains are likely to be subject to severe delays and last-minute cancellations..It has apologised for the inconvenience caused, and advised passengers to cancel or postpone their journeys..According to Eurostar’s service update page, five trains have been cancelled already – the ES 9007, ES 9013 and the ES 9023 from Paris Gard de Nord to London St Pancras, and the ES 9008 and ES 9018 running the other way..Oil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) climbed by almost 2% on Wednesday as investors digested the fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alongside renewed hopes that the US Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates in the near term..Brent crude rose 1.8% to $68.34 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate gained 1.7% to $65.49 in early trading..On Tuesday, US president Donald Trump gave China, Iran’s largest buyer of crude, the green light to continue importing oil from the Islamic Republic, in what appeared to be a bid to reinforce the ceasefire. The move was widely interpreted as undermining long-standing US sanctions on Iranian exports. However, a senior White House official later clarified that sanctions enforcement would remain in place..The uptick comes after a tumultuous week for oil markets, marked by dramatic swings in sentiment. Prices surged over the weekend following US air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities that fuelled fears of disrupted crude supply. But markets reversed course sharply when the White House announced a truce between Tehran and Tel Aviv..Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:.Babcock (BAB.L) surged as much as 13% on Wednesday, to the top of the FTSE 100, on a very strong preliminary results update and bullish sounding CEO comments..The company reported a 53% rise in pre-tax profits to £329m in the year to the end of March, while CEO David Lockwood hailed a “new era for defence”..It comes as the UK has committed to NATO’s 5% of GDP target and today announced plans to buy jets capable of firing nuclear weapons, marking a radical expansion of Britain’s nuclear deterrent..Babcock's dividend is up 30% and it raised its outlook for FY26 margins..BAE Systems (BA.L) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) are both trading firmer on the back of the news too as investors continue to buy this trend which seems to have significant structural tailwinds..Babcock told investors:.Britons are spending more time on their mobile phones than watching television as younger people use social media apps such as TikTok and YouTube..The Telegraph has the details:.UK adults now use their phones for an average of three hours and 21 minutes a day. That compares with three hours and 16 minutes spent watching TV, according to data from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA)..It marks the first time in the survey’s 20-year history that mobile consumption has eclipsed TV viewing after a steady rise over the past decade..In 2015, British adults spent just one hour and 17 minutes on their phones. By contrast, TV viewing has remained relatively stable over the same period..The figures highlight how smartphones have developed from communication devices to entertainment hubs, with streaming platforms and social media apps dominating the attention economy..Separate figures from Ofcom show that 92% of Britons online use video apps such as YouTube or TikTok, while traditional TV viewing continues to decline as audiences increasingly turn to streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS)..Tesla’s (TSLA) European sales continued to slide last month, despite a rising demand for electric cars..The latest car sales data revealed that Tesla sold 8,729 vehicles across the European Union in May, down from 14,682 the previous year. This is a 40.5% drop, which shrinks Tesla’s market share from 1.6% to 0.9%..Overall, sales of electric cars rose by 25% last month – with 142,776 battery electric cars sold, up from 114,231 in May 2024..The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) reported:.Up until May 2025, battery-electric cars accounted for 15.4% of the total EU market share, an increase from the low baseline of 12.1% in May 2024 YTD..Hybrid-electric car registrations continue to surge, capturing 35.1% of the market, remaining the preferred choice among EU consumers..Meanwhile, the combined market share of petrol and diesel cars fell to 38.1%, down from 48.5% over the same period in 2024..The overall European car market grew by 1.6% in May, year on year, but is down 0.6% during 2025..It comes as Tesla’s shares have been sliding recently, with investors pointing to CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, the company’s outdated model lineup, and competition from rivals such as China’s BYD (1211.HK)..Britain's labour market is showing further slowdown signs, according to surveys published on Wednesday which pointed to below-inflation pay growth and a fall in job vacancies, especially for graduate-level jobs..Most pay settlements offered by private sector employers held at 3% in the three months to the end of May - lower than the most recent inflation reading of 3.4% — and almost 15% of firms gave smaller raises of 2.5%, data firm Brightmine said..Separate figures from recruitment platform Indeed showed a latest fall in job vacancies which were down 5% in mid-June from their level at the end of March..Vacancies were 21% below their pre-pandemic level, leaving the UK as the only advanced economy tracked by Indeed with job openings lower than before the coronavirus pandemic..The share of graduate-level posts advertised was its lowest since at least 2018 with the biggest drops in human resources, accountancy and marketing, typically areas most vulnerable to a slowdown in the economy..Indeed said the fall could also be linked to the impact of artificial intelligence on some job roles..Read the full article here.Stocks in Asia rose overnight as the Israeli government said it had agreed to a truce after achieving its war objectives with Iran..The Nikkei (^N225) rose 0.4% on the day in Tokyo as a summary of opinions from the BOJ’s latest policy meeting suggested that some policymakers supported maintaining steady rates amid uncertainty of the effects of US tariffs on Japan’s economy..Some board members observed stronger-than-expected inflation, with one member proposing that the central bank may need to raise rates decisively despite the prevailing economic uncertainty..Meanwhile the Hang Seng (^HSI) climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong.

Pony AI Inc. (NASDAQ:PONY), an autonomous driving company based in China, is similarly expanding robotaxi operations into international markets. Last month, it partnered with Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) for the expansion of its robotaxis in key markets in the Middle East, as well as other countries. Pony AI Inc. (NASDAQ:PONY) co-founder Lou Tiancheng was quoted as saying in a report by Car News China that Tesla “hasn’t yet taken a seat at the L4 poker table,” which classifies vehicles with both driverless operations and large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles..A fleet of autonomous vehicles driving down a sun-drenched highway.

Already, Tesla Model Ys are arriving in India, shipped from Tesla's China factory..While this might seem like a sudden move, it's actually the culmination of many years of considering entering the market, and pulling back due to disagreements over tariffs and manufacturing. That seemed to change when Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the U.S. last February..This won't be an easy task for Tesla, however. Due to tariffs the Model Y is expected to go on sale in India around $56,000 before taxes and insurance. This compares to $44,990 for the same model in the U.S. market, which drops to $37,490 with tax credits applied -- for however long that lasts. Further, India's EV share of its automotive market is just over 5%, and premium cars represent less than 2% market share..It's a good move for Tesla, and a logical one, especially considering China's automotive production overcapacity problem -- although it's less a problem for Tesla -- and sending vehicles from China to India helps. But investors would also be wise to temper growth expectations; the market isn't exactly ripe for the picking when it comes to expensive EVs..After years of promising, the moment has finally arrived for Tesla's robotaxi ambitions. Over the weekend Tesla launched a small pilot robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, which some believe is the beginning of a much more lucrative business thesis for the automaker..""We attended Tesla's robotaxi launch ... and got the opportunity to take multiple rides in a robotaxi,"" Wedbush Securities said in a research note June 22, according to Automotive News. ""Overall, these robotaxis exceeded our expectations and offered a seamless and personalized travel experience that has lit the spark for autonomous driving.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-makes-2-big-moves-011400438.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Yal Finanz Prize Submarine is here with that story, Prize. .Yeah, we're just showing that the Hollywood set where they did the actual presentation last October didn't go exactly as planned. We saw a lot of the Tesla stands excited about taking their robotaxis right. But there were some hiccups, right? We saw some of the videos that they were taking some of the vehicles were speeding above post speed limits. And then most egregiously, there was an incident where a car, you see right here, attempted to turn left, didn't actually do that, and went straight through a left hand turn only lane, and then crossed a double yellow, as you see here, which is also a traffic violation, a major one actually in Texas. So Nizza says that they're aware of these incidents, and they're monitoring them, and that they'll take necessary actions to protect road safety. So Nizza is kind of possibly getting involved here. Meanwhile, Waymo entering Atlanta, like they said they're officially up open for business with partnering with Uber as their sort of platform partner. So you know, Waymo's with Uber in Atlanta, and also Austin, where Tesla's tests is taking place. And then also they're in LA, San Francisco, um, and places like that. .Do you think, Prize, you you hear about something like this, does it in any way, could it in any way slow down, disrupt the expansion of this service across the country? .You mean these little hiccups here? Yeah. I, it kind of brings a little bit of the enthusiasm down, but it's not ready for prime time, right? They have the safety drivers, riders sitting in the passenger seat, you have teleoperators who are remotely watching the car. You know, a lot of Tesla investors are excited about the fact that this test actually started, it's happening. But they have a long way to go to catch up to Waymo, which is doing 250,000 completed robotaxi trips a week without sort of these incidents that we're seeing right now in Tesla. .All right, let's bring in our ensemble now for more on the ride shares today. Tesla, got a Google, Uber, Lyft, they're all in focus. Julie, you know, I, Tesla did slip a bit today, of course they had a nice pop yesterday. Though, as Prize rightfully points out, as Musk begins this journey here, he's got some big competition, including Waymo. .Yeah, I mean, and if if there are these hiccups, I mean, as we know, federal regulators have sort of left it up to states and municipalities, whether they're even going to allow these things to go forward. You see it going forward on a city by city basis, right? So even though Tesla is still proceeding with its tests in Austin, if it continues to see, I mean, like, we're calling it a hiccup, but, you know, it could have been a lot worse, right? So the question is, how is Tesla addressing these issues? And then the next question is, when Tesla goes to apply for its next approval in its next city, is this going to inform that? Is this going to then cause some friction with letting that move forward? Now, we always know if we're on an Elon Musk timeline, you can't necessarily expect things to happen as he thinks or says that they will. Um, but this is just one more thing to consider when we're talking about that sort of speed to market, and then capturing that market share. .Chris, I want to bring you here as well, as the one person on the panel who actually has a portfolio to run here. What do you make of this big fight? I got Tesla, Waymo, got Amazon in there, Uber, Lyft. .Yeah, it's kind of a crowded space. Uh, you know, and it's kind of an emerging market. Uh, I, I think that this is going to be proven out over time. I think that the interesting way to play it from a, you know, differentiated way is, maybe we don't focus necessarily on, uh, you know, what Google is doing or Tesla is doing, but what does this mean for Uber? What does this mean for Lyft when we think about the removal of a key cost for them, right? And the amount of incremental profits that can drop to the bottom line once they have made these investments. To me, that's a lot more exciting.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PARA..The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed Monday that it is in contact with Tesla to gather information after robotaxis were seen driving the wrong way, slamming on brakes unexpectedly, and reacting to parked police vehicles without cause..Tesla launched the limited pilot program over the weekend, deploying 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles outfitted with its latest Full Self-Driving Unsupervised system.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. .However you may feel about him personally, you have to admit that in the cliched “all publicity is good publicity” sense, Elon Musk may be among the best to ever do it..Earlier in the month, Musk decided, for whatever reason, that his alliance with U.S. President Trump had come to an end, which led to a public spat between the two, in which Musk seemingly burned various bridges with Trump and his supporters..That seems bad for Musk’s business interests, as it could see Tesla and SpaceX lose valuable government grants and contracts, while it could also risk losing the MAGA crowd on X, where they now drive significant engagement..But in the immediate term at least, X is spinning it as a positive, by highlighting the subsequent increase in in-app activity resulting from the Trump-Musk blow-up. .As you can see, X is claiming that it’s seen an increase in its daily to monthly active user ratio, rising to 45%, while it’s also seen an 8% rise on overall daily active usage in the last two weeks, versus the first week of June (the Trump/Elon stoush kicked off at the end of that first week)..So, more controversy is good for business on X, even if it could be less beneficial for Musk and Co. in the long run. .Though the daily to monthly active user ratio is a little less impressive when compared to X’s previously communicated usage numbers. .Back in March, when xAI announced that it would be acquiring X, Musk claimed that X is now up to 600 million monthly active users. X has repeatedly noted that its daily active user count is 250 million, where it’s been sitting since November 2022, which would put X’s DAU/MAU ratio at 41%..So an increase to 45% suggests that X’s daily actives have increased to around 270 million, based on these figures. .Yet, in March 2023, X claimed to have reached a new user milestone of 500 million MAU, with 250 million DAU at the time. So X’s average MAU/DAU ratio had been at 50% for some time, potentially till this year, which means that a 45% ratio on this front is actually a decline on previous usage. .Though, even so, an increase is better. We don’t know the specifics of the numbers being compared here, because X doesn’t provide regular user count updates. But going on its most recently shared figures, it is seemingly seeing some improvement in active engagement this month. .For comparison, the average MAU/DAU figure for all the major social apps is just over 50%, so X is still behind the norm on this front.

If you have been following Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for the last decade, you will know that it has always attracted a cult following.","Tesla's Robotaxi service has finally launched in Austin, Texas..Self-driving and robotics help justify the company's premium valuation, but Elon Musk's political antics remain a risk..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.If you have been following Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for the last decade, you will know that it has always attracted a cult following. The electric automaker is perceived as a technology disruptor that isn't afraid to push the envelope under the leadership of its controversial CEO, Elon Musk. And it has typically enjoyed a premium valuation compared to tangible performance metrics like revenue and earnings. .But despite a nosebleed valuation, Tesla has historically proven its naysayers wrong, achieving its first full-year profit in 2020 and becoming the most profitable American automaker in 2022..The honeymoon period didn't last long. Three years later, Tesla is once again overvalued because of a dramatic drop in profits amid electric vehicle (EV) competition and consumer boycotts related to Elon Musk's political activism. Over the next ten years, the company will have to prove itself once again. Let's dig deeper to see how this might play out..America's most successful tech giants have a clear pattern. They often use the scale and infrastructure developed for their core business to establish a competitive edge in even bigger opportunities. Amazon used its e-commerce marketplace as an anchor tenant for its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nvidia's video game graphics tech turned into the foundation for its leadership in generative AI hardware. Tesla aims to pull off a similar pivot with its auto business. .Something clearly needs to change. Tesla's first-quarter earnings demonstrate that EV manufacturing is no longer capable of justifying an otherworldly valuation. For context, shares trade for a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 184 compared to the S&P 500 average of 28..Meanwhile, Tesla's total revenue fell 9% year over year to $19.3 billion, driven by an alarming 20% drop in total automotive sales due to intense consumer boycotts in the U.S. and Europe. Recent refreshes of the Model Y and Model 3 did little to stop the bleeding. And operating profits tanked 66% year over year to $399 million. New business verticals will likely be the only way for Tesla to regain a growth trajectory..Over the next ten years, Tesla's story will depend on its non-automotive revenue streams, which have likely always been part of its long-term strategy. Some of these businesses are already booming. For example, energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% to $2.73 billion, representing around 14% of total sales. And because this business focuses on commercial and government clients, it is shielded from some of the brand erosion Tesla has seen among regular consumers.

Bloomberg News was first to report on Tesla’s Robotaxi infractions..Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo, considered the leader in the robotaxi space with 250,000 robotaxi trips completed each week with no safety driver, has officially opened for business in Atlanta..Via Uber (UBER), Waymo allows users to summon its robotaxis for driverless rides. Uber said in a post that riders will be able to travel across 65 square miles of Atlanta, with plans to expand in the future..“Riders who request an UberX, Comfort, or Comfort Electric could be matched with a Waymo fully autonomous all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicle — at no additional cost. Before a nearby Waymo vehicle is sent your way, you’ll always have the option to accept or switch to a non-AV ride,” Uber said in a statement..In addition to Waymo's Uber partnership in Atlanta, the companies continue to offer robotaxi rides in Austin..Waymo offers its robotaxi services through its own app in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix and will also be adding New York City to the list via a supervised test soon..Tesla hasn’t revealed its next steps or when the general public will be allowed to summon a Robotaxi in Austin.

It’s brought together industry lobbies from the Crypto Council for Innovation to the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Even Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are finding common cause, along with predictable parts of the tech sector including chipmakers and wireless providers..The reason is that chips are now in almost everything: refrigerators and microwaves, tire pressure sensors and navigation systems, electronic bidets and sonar equipment and, of course, smartphones and computers. Tariffs threaten to snarl supply lines and jack up costs for consumers..“There’s a large mismatch between the amount of chips we use in this country in various products and the supply created here in the US,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview. “Putting a tax on those imports will simply raise the cost, and that’s not a good thing for consumers.”.Case in point is the marine association, which warns the impact would be felt by more than 1,300 manufacturers who face higher expenses for essentials like propulsion technology, engines and GPS systems..“These systems are not optional luxuries — they are fundamental to safety, function and performance,” the association said. “Many components have no US equivalent or are only available from highly concentrated suppliers overseas.”.The boating sector’s concerns were among comments from 154 stakeholders submitted to a Commerce Department review of whether to slap tariffs on chips as part of Trump’s campaign to redraw global supply lines and boost domestic manufacturing. Predictable tech sources weighed in, including chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp. But feedback also landed from a wide spectrum of sectors, along with trading partners like Japan and Brazil..The companies, trade groups and individuals who commented on the chips investigation largely signaled support for the president’s vision of deepening the US manufacturing base and expanding the American workforce.

However, at a little over 16 times estimated profits, its valuation is a fraction of Tesla’s at 150 times, a multiple based heavily on expectations for a service that investors had been waiting years for..“People are underestimating Waymo in a pretty significant way, while overestimating Tesla,” said Samuel Rines, macro strategist at WisdomTree. Alphabet’s valuation “assigns basically zero value to Waymo even though it has the best tech, it is already operating, and it has deals with OEMs,” referring to original equipment manufacturers..Alphabet rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla shares were little changed..Investor excitement about self-driving technology is rooted in the vast size of the potential market. Annual ride-hailing sales could exceed $325 billion by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. As much as $20 billion of that could come from robotaxis, analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a research note on Monday..Waymo currently offers self-driving paid rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and San Francisco and just began offering trips through Uber Technologies Inc.’s platform in Atlanta, with Miami and Washington expected next year. Last week, Waymo applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City, sending Uber and Lyft Inc. shares lower..Waymo was valued at more than $45 billion in October, putting it roughly on par with the market capitalizations of both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. It’s a drop in the bucket for Alphabet, however, with a market value of more than $2 trillion..Still, Waymo is an increasingly attractive part of Alphabet’s portfolio and should offer “long-term upside” for shareholders, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-lacks-tesla-stock-buzz-101252621.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The B-2 stealth bombers, worth more than $2 billion a piece, traveled more than 30 hours from the United States to Iran and went undetected..The attacks come after multiple attacks on Iran from Israel, and after Trump administration officials accused Iranian government officials of dragging their feet on ongoing nuclear negotiations. Overall, the mission was successful and executed flawlessly. However, several Trump administration members like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have voiced concerns about Iranian retribution and have warned against it..Initially, US equity index futures plummeted while oil futures rose at the overnight futures open at 8 pm EST on Sunday, underscoring the ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ knee-jerk mentality of many Wall Street traders. However, as is often the case with scary and unexpected headlines, cooler heads prevailed and the collective market and pricing tend to know more than the headlines..Briefly after the futures open, Nasdaq futures shook off the news, bounced more than 200 points, and flipped green. Meanwhile, crude oil futures, which were up more than 5% at the open, have faded in a waterfall-like fashion and are flat since Friday..Two things are abundantly clear from the price action:.1. The Bull Market Is Resilient and Intact: US equity markets have done a 180-degree flip since the first quarter. Then, any semblance of ‘bad news’ (often tariff-related) sent stocks down 3-4%. Today, stocks recover rapidly after bad news, signaling that bulls are in control of the market..2. The Market Believes Iranian Retribution Is Unlikely: While it’s impossible for investors to predict the future, price action is the closest thing an investor has to a crystal ball. The dramatic fade in oil prices shows that investors do not believe that Iran will seek hardcore retribution, such as shutting down “The Straight of Hormuz” (an important choke point between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman) or attacking US troops.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-133700578.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

TSLA shares are breaking out above multi-week highs and are up more than 6% in early trading as volume turnover is swelling and tracking to levels of more than 60% above the 50-day average volume..Silicon Valley legends like Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t get to where they are without massive risk-taking and a ‘move fast, break things’ approach. For instance, after Elon Musk scored his first $175 million fortune with the successful sale of PayPal to eBay,he immediately began deploying most (but not all) of his capital to his new endeavors – SpaceX and Tesla..However, when the 2008 Global Financial Crisis hit, Musk was forced to risk all of his capital (and actually had to borrow money) to survive. The bet paid off, and the rest is history – Musk became the wealthiest person on Earth..Whether it’s X.com (formally Twitter) or SpaceX, Musk prefers to move at lightning speed and fix mistakes later. Nevertheless, Musk is wisely taking a measured approach with the robotaxi debut since the stakes are high. With global car sales slumping and Musk’s recent political, reputational damage, Tesla’s robotaxi service must move forward without a hitch..As a result, Tesla is debuting the robotaxi in a geo-fenced-in zone, charging a low fee of $4.20, and has a safety rider in the front passenger seat to ensure the debut goes smoothly. Thus far, investors are cheering the measured side of Elon Musk..The robotaxi launch is invite-only and includes social media personalities and investors. Tesla is using modified Model Y vehicles (the best-selling car currently) with updated software instead of the futuristic Cybercab concept Musk initially pitched..The move to use Model Ys was likely to avoid falling further behind Alphabet’s rapidly expanding ‘Waymo’ robotaxi service. With Waymo already operating in Austin, investors will be watching to see which service clients choose once Tesla opens up its robotaxi service to the public..Between Musk’s controversies and slowing sales, TSLA still has its fair share of skeptics. For example, prominent short seller Jim Chanos is bearish on the company, citing valuation concerns and competition. However, these skeptics will likely have to eat their words if Musk and his Tesla team can scale its robotaxi service into 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-131600943.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

More importantly, I'll detail several different ways in which investors can invest in the Bitcoin movement..For much of its history, Bitcoin has been labeled as a highly speculative asset -- and rightfully so.

Now comes the hard part..The electric-vehicle maker deployed its first-ever driverless cabs in Austin, Texas, on Sunday in a small-scale test of carefully monitored Model Y vehicles. Next, the company faces the steep challenge of executing on CEO Elon Musk’s ambition to refine the software and upload it to millions of Teslas within a year or so..Such a rapid expansion will prove extremely difficult, about a dozen industry analysts and autonomous-vehicle technology experts told Reuters. These observers expressed a range of views about Tesla’s prospects but all cautioned against assuming a light-speed robotaxi rollout..Some pointed to advantages Tesla might exploit to overtake rivals including Alphabet’s Waymo and a host of Chinese auto and tech companies. Tesla has mass-manufacturing capacity, and it pioneered remote software updates it can use for self-driving upgrades. The automaker also does not use sensors such as radar and lidar like Waymo and most rivals; instead, it depends solely on cameras and artificial intelligence..“A rollout could be really quick. If the software works, Tesla robotaxi could drive any road in the world,” said Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, while cautioning that Tesla is still “testing the product.”.In Austin, Tesla launched a choreographed experiment involving maybe a dozen cars, operating in limited geography, with safety monitors in the front passenger seat; remote “teleoperators”; plans to avoid bad weather; and hand-picked pro-Tesla influencers as passengers..For years, Musk has said Tesla would soon operate its own autonomous ride-hailing service and also turn any Tesla, new or used, into a cash-generating robotaxi for its customers. That will be “orders of magnitude” more difficult than testing in Austin, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor focused on autonomous-driving regulation..“It’s like announcing that, ‘I’m going to Mars’ and then, you know, going to Cleveland,” Smith said..Musk has said Tesla will reach Mars, in that metaphor, quite quickly: ""I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,"" he said in April..Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla shares ended 8.2% higher at $348.68 on Monday on investor enthusiasm over the robotaxi launch..Given Tesla’s AI-dependent approach, its challenge will be machine-training robotaxis to handle complex traffic “edge cases,” said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.

The move also coincided with a strong uptick in the relative strength index, indicating accelerating price momentum..Let’s identify three key overhead areas on Tesla’s chart to watch if the shares continue to rally and also locate an important support level worth monitoring..The first overhead area to watch sits around $365. This area, just 5% above Monday’s closing price, could provide resistance near last month’s prominent peak, which also aligns with the February countertrend high and twin peaks that formed on the chart last November..A convincing close above this area could trigger a rally toward $430.

Remember, the company's core business is still electric vehicles (EVs), and that business is facing a critical event in just a few weeks' time..Tesla is expected to announce its second-quarter EV delivery figures in the first week of July. As many investors likely recall, first-quarter deliveries came in at roughly 337,000, its lowest quarterly number in over two years. Many investors have been concerned that Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump and his period of leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have alienated a significant portion of Tesla's potential customer base..While Musk has stepped down from his work with DOGE to refocus on his businesses, data thus far on Tesla's sales in the second quarter has been less than encouraging. Monthly sales data from Europe showed that Tesla's sales once again faltered in April in countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, and France..Other data suggests that its sales in China have struggled in the second quarter as well. Aside from politics and brand image, Tesla may also be struggling there as a result of increasing competition from competitors like BYD, which has grabbed a dominant market share in China. BYD's EVs are cheaper and its newest tech can charge faster than Tesla's. These factors, in my opinion, will pose a bigger problem for Tesla than its brand or political issues, which are likely to fade over time..Wall Street analysts are modeling for second-quarter deliveries of roughly 400,000, which would be an improvement from the first quarter, but a 10% year-over-year decline. However, some analysts don't expect investors to care much if Tesla misses estimates.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-just-achieved-big-milestone-003000555.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Tesla stock  (TSLA)  surged roughly 8.2% on June 23 following its Robotaxi launch during the weekend..The electric vehicle maker on Sunday deployed a small group of self-driving taxis picking up paying passengers in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk called the event the “culmination of a decade of hard work” in a post on X, noting that “the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla.”.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives attended the Robotaxi event and said he was ""very impressed."".💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵.“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” he described..“The interior features two touchscreen panels: one in the front and one in the back row above the AC vent. The back row panel is able to integrate with the user's Tesla account and sync with their Robotaxi app and automatically loads the user's content onto a suite of apps including Apple Music, Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, Disney+, and more.”.The self-driving experience may feel futuristic, but the need to buckle up hasn’t changed. And the same goes for how investors view Tesla stock..Tesla is the world’s most valuable automaker, but its investors had a tough time earlier this year. EV sales slowed in key markets like Europe, China, and California, while Musk drew criticism for focusing more on politics than the company’s core business..In April, Tesla reported weak earnings earlier this week, including a 20% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue and a 71% plunge in net income..Related: Tesla’s robotaxi finally launches, but there’s a twist.Many Wall Street analysts now believe that much of Tesla's sky-high stock value rests on its ability to deliver robotaxis and humanoid robots. Musk said his goal is to expand the service to many U.S. cities by the end of this year, with “millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year.”.Still, the company could face major challenges in scaling up the Robotaxi service quickly..Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed legislation on June 20 requiring a state permit to operate self-driving vehicles, effective September 1. However, compliance in Texas remains far easier than in some states, notably California, which requires the submission of vehicle-testing data under state oversight, according to Reuters.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotaxi-news-sends-tesla-stock-000507141.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Bloomberg was the first to report that the NHTSA reached out to Tesla. The NHTSA confirmed to TechCrunch that it has contacted the automaker..“NHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,” the company said in an emailed statement. “NHTSA will continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment, in accordance with the Vehicle Safety Act and our data-driven, risk-based investigative process.  Under U.S. law, NHTSA does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems — rather, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets NHTSA’s rigorous safety standards, and the agency investigates incidents involving potential safety defects. Following an assessment of those reports and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.”.On Sunday, Tesla began giving paid rides to invited customers in South Austin. The launch, while limited in size and scope, is the first real test of the automaker’s autonomous vehicle technology. Tesla does sell its branded Full Self-Driving Supervised software to owners of its vehicles. FSD handles steering and braking when engaged. However, it is considered an advanced driver-assistance system that requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel..Tesla robotaxis are equipped with an unsupervised version of FSD, although the company has not provided specific details about this software. The robotaxis, which customers can hail via an app, are meant to drive on their own. Notably, Tesla robotaxis have a human “safety monitor” sitting in the front passenger seat during these rides..Videos posted online show the Tesla robotaxis driving over the speed limit and in one case, swerving into the wrong lane..TechCrunch reported Sunday that Ed Niedermeyer, author of “Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors,” who is in Austin to monitor the robotaxi rollout, took video showing a Tesla branded robotaxi suddenly hitting its brakes on two occasions without reason.

The Google parent's two publicly traded stocks ended the day around 1% lower in price, comparing unfavorably to the nearly 1% gain of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)..That rival is Alphabet's peer in the self-driving taxi space, Tesla. On Sunday, the high-profile auto company officially launched its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Although rides were limited to selected users, the event went off smoothly, without any reported accidents..While Alphabet's great strength and the source of its wealth is the advertising it sells for its omnipresent search engine, the company has been pushing into other cutting-edge tech ventures for much of its corporate life. One of the more prominent of these is its own autonomous taxi service, Waymo, which has been operational in a handful of U.S. cities for months, even years..With the launch of the Tesla service, Alphabet now has a competitor in the self-driving taxi space. Investors rarely like when one of their companies suddenly loses a big competitive advantage..Yet the reactive hit to Alphabet's stock was minimal, most likely because many investors realize that the self-driving taxi segment isn't (yet) large enough to seriously impact either their company or Tesla..On top of that, Tesla hasn't revealed when, where, or to what degree it'll expand its Austin Robotaxi rollout. This suggests that the company is being cautious -- as it should be -- about widening the service..So far, the auto-taxi space has been developing more smoothly than many expected; if it maintains the pace, such services will be commonplace before long.

TD Cowen equity analyst Itay Michaeli says there were two aspects to the launch that went better than expected. Find out what they are in the video above..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here..Day one does seem like it was successful. There were two aspects of the launch that were better than what we would have expected coming in. The first is where the vehicles actually operated or the operational design domain was larger than what we would have expected and some of the pick up and drop off activity looked pretty impressive for a first day in a robotaxi operation. While it's still premature to draw meaningful big picture conclusions from a single day, but so far a pretty impressive launch and we'll kind of have to monitor it in the weeks and months ahead. .How how quickly and aggressively do you think Musk can expand this service across the country? .I think their strategy of a measured approach is the right one. Safety is paramount. We've seen situations in the past where robo taxi networks had safety issues and some of them actually shut down as a result of it. It's we want to first and foremost monitor the safety record, rider and stakeholder feedback in the weeks and months ahead. Does the operational design domain expand from where they are currently? Does the fleet size expand from here? But going at it slow, particularly given Tesla's lead relative to other car companies in the autonomous vehicle space, does give them some breathing room to move slowly. And so execution around that is key. I think if all goes well, probably in the next few months, investors will be asking what the next city could be. And for us, we're also really watching what ends up happening to the consumer fleet. Whether maybe an overlooked opportunity frankly in the Tesla autonomous vehicle story to, you know, roll out eyes off FSD features that could both complement the robo taxi fleet and lead to new services and features for consumers that can drive up not only new revenue streams for Tesla, but also vehicle demand itself. .In this space Musk has plenty of competition. He's got Waymo and Amazon Zoox is in there, and when your clients are asking you what what you think his competitive advantages are, what do you tell them? .Sure. Cost is one of them. Speed is another and the talent they have at Tesla. This is a 1 and a half trillion dollar mobility market in the US. The ride share industry today is only about $60 billion. So we still have a lot more to go. We think Tesla's competitive advantage could really allow them to deploy AVs, both robo taxis and consumer AV features in less dense MSAs, where today the ride share market is not particularly highly penetrated, and because of Tesla's cost advantage because of things like shadow mode validation that they can use from their existing fleet. We think they have an opportunity to launch robo taxis in markets are today less penetrated and complement those with consumer vehicles, and also, of course, lead to new features and services as well. Think of the vehicle getting your deliveries in the middle of the night. Think of dropping you off at the movie theater and picking you up later on. Features that you could charge for and of course, could create an unprecedented proposition for consumer demand across Tesla's vehicles. We know, of course, demand has been more challenging recent quarters. So we look at the AV story is very complementary to the overall EV story and demand story at Tesla, but cost and speed really are key advantages they have today.

Filosa is coming in at a challenging time for the automaker..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here..Now time for some of today's trending tickers. Julie Hyman and Thomas Hayes is here with me to discuss and some of the names we are watching are Tesla and Stellantis. I'm going to start off here with Tesla, which is seeing big gains today after the unveiling of the company's robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? .Well, it's like a magician. Look over here. It's the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he's right, I I just saw a quote from him, uh, we expect hundreds of thousands of robo taxis if not millions by the end of the year. That is a bold statement. If he gets anywhere close to it, uh maybe today's move is an underestimation. However, uh if we look at the car business, uh that's another story and uh and I think it's it's a trade-off. You're always betting when you pay the valuation that you do for Tesla, you're always betting on the man and he's delivered for many, many years and and the followers want to continue to bet on him. So this is a step in the right direction. Uh robo taxis could be game changing, but it remains to be seen. If you have drivers in the car, it's not a robo taxi. .Julie, bring you in here. I mean as Tom says, you bet on the man, right? Uh and this is what Must says. Must has said this. If you if you own my stock, it's because you are a long-term believer in my vision for autonomy and robots, Julie. .Right. Of course. I've said this for a long time. Tesla is a faith faith-based stock, right? People are not buying it because of what is happening today or what happened yesterday. They're buying it because what they think is going to happen, what they believe is going to happen tomorrow and in the years to come. I mean, our friend Dan Ives over at Wedbush is a prime example of that. He was there, him being a big Tesla booster, no surprise. He was there uh over the weekend and he talked again about the trillion dollar autonomous uh possibility, the journey as he calls it, that is not just to do with the robo taxis, but to do with the AI uh sort of thesis that he has around the stock overall. I thought it was interesting our friend Jordan Klein over at Mizuho, he's a desk analyst over there and he said, you know, the people that they sent to do this test were people that they knew were Tesla supporters. And even given that, Bloomberg is reporting that some of those influencers, some of those Tesla folks did point out that the tests didn't go without flaws, right? They pointed out that, you know, some of the cars went above the speed limit, which maybe isn't a big deal, but they pointed out uh maybe some turns that didn't make sense. There was one uh group of folks in a car reportedly that tried to push the button to ask it to stop. And I guess eventually it stopped in middle of the road. So there are still some bugs that they're working out. It's not like that this thing is, you know, flawless and they're going to be rolling it out to a bigger area and to other cities right away. That said, a lot of analysts did say that this went a little bit better than expected. It was at least neutral. .Yeah. Not not to mention the competition as well. You got Waymo, you got Amazon Zoox, but to the Tom's point, stocks tacking on about 8% in today's trade. All right, here's another one we got to check out. Stellantis is new CEO Antonio Filosa stepping into his role today by avoiding any major changes to the senior management team. Analyst at Jeffries saying that revamping Stellantis may not be a full-time job for Filosa, who is also still maintaining his role as head of the North American market. Shares of that automaker have been dropping since the market open. Stock prices overall down about 10% since announcing Filosa's appointment as CEO. This one is interesting, Tom. You did have, all right, so we reorganize management, um, the CEO is part of this 13 member senior leadership team at the company. You know, Bloomberg does note, the new CEO here, he he's got a lot on his plate. I mean, halting a sales line in the US, they talk about an aging lineup, a model delays, pricing blunders, but what do you make of it? .I think rule number one is they should probably get rid of the other 12 managers. Uh, then they could be lean and and more efficient. Look, that's a tough business. We are in the uh, we have a business uh that supplies the ceiling systems around the windows, the fluid transfer systems. I'd rather be an arms dealer because what's going to happen uh is uh Bes is going to be successful with bringing rates down modestly this summer. That's going to bring down financing rates for cars, but it's going to be a race to the bottom. There's going to be a huge amount of supply. Their margins are going to continue to go down. The OEMs, the suppliers of the parts are going to want be the ones that do well because we've got average car on the road is 13.5 years. There's a huge pent up replacement cycle. We just need to see the incentives and we need to see the financing rates come down and they're going to start to do huge, huge volumes. The question is, what are the margins of the stellantis, the Ford and the GM going to be? I don't want to be in that business. .All right. Uh Julie, bring you back in here. I hope Tom is right that those rates are coming down because I would be certainly interested in making a purchase, as you well know, my friend, if they did. But Stellantis, your thoughts. .Oh, I know. I know. I mean, if you look at how Stellantis has done over the past 12 months, I'm just looking at the numbers here. They're down like 55%, the US shares. Um, and we know that the car business overall has been challenged as of late, right? But compare that with GM, little changed over the past year. Ford is down about 12%. So we see there obviously that Stellantis has been underperforming its peers. It's not just sort of struggling in what is a difficult car market. It's doing worse. And I don't know that we know yet uh from Filosa what those steps are going to be to turn it around. .We do not. .P ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-still-climbing-stellantis-ceo-200556746.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

On June 17, it was reported that Tesla is implementing another production halt at its Gigafactory in Texas, which will affect the Model Y and Cybertruck production lines. This shutdown is slated to begin on June 30 and extend through the week of the July Fourth holiday. It will mark the second such pause at the facility in 2 months and the 3rd in the past year..The production halts come amid mounting pressure on Tesla due to slower demand and increasing inventory levels. Earlier in June this year, reports indicated that Tesla was renting overflow parking lots across the US to store unsold vehicles, which included Cybertrucks. Cybertruck production has already been scaled back in 2025, with sales tracking at about half of the previous year’s figures, despite the introduction of cheaper variants, eligibility for federal tax credits, and increased discounts..As of March 2025, fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks had been delivered, and around 10,000 remain unsold across the US. Tesla experienced a 13% year-over-year drop in total deliveries in Q1 2025, which the company attributed partly to the Model Y design refresh causing a production bottleneck. However, current estimates suggest that Q2 2025 deliveries could be down as much as 19% to 20% compared to Q2 2024.

But 2025 is shaping up to be one of the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s most challenging years in recent memory, with its stock facing significant volatility. While Tesla’s rebound from its April lows briefly offered some relief to investors, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan has recently issued a grave warning: Tesla could post its first year of negative free cash flow since 2018..In a recent research note, Langan pointed to multiple headwinds dragging on Tesla’s financial health, including weak delivery numbers, risks to income from regulatory credits, aggressive capital expenditures, and pricing pressures.

With that, let’s get into it!.Tesla (TSLA) is a prominent innovator dedicated to accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy. The Elon Musk-led powerhouse designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. It also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and various other services related to its products. In addition, the company is increasingly focusing on products and services centered around AI, robotics, and automation. Its market cap currently stands at $1.04 trillion..Shares of the EV maker have slumped 12.8% on a year-to-date basis. TSLA stock had a rough start to 2025, tumbling from mid-January highs near $430 per share to a low of $218.80 by early April..The stock was weighed down by slowing EV sales, CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities, and escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. TSLA stock found support around the $220 level as broader market sentiment steadied following President Donald Trump’s decision to pause or reduce most of his tariffs. From a technical analysis standpoint, some traders interpret the price action as forming a triple bottom pattern, while others see an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The price then broke above the slice neckline in late April, climbing as high as $362.89. The upward move was fueled by several factors, including the U.S.-China trade truce, Musk’s pledge to step back from U.S. politics and refocus on Tesla, and renewed investor enthusiasm over the company’s self-driving advancements. However, the positive momentum has since faded, with TSLA shares pulling back and experiencing a sharp drop in early June amid the Trump-Musk feud.

But can Tesla really scale this?,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) just gave Wall Street a new reason to believe in its AI-first future. On Sunday, the company quietly rolled out a limited fleet of robotaxis in Austin, Texas offering $4.20 flat-fee rides without human drivers. It's the first time real passengers have paid to ride fully autonomous Teslas, and on Monday, the market responded in kind: the stock jumped 10%, adding nearly $100 billion to Tesla's valuation. For Elon Musk, it's a critical pivot away from chasing mass EV adoption, and toward a bet-the-company push into autonomy and robotics..Early reactions? Mixed, but promising. Wedbush's Dan Ives took multiple rides and called the experience comfortable and safe, noting how the car handled narrow roads, traffic, and human unpredictability with striking caution. Influencers on X flooded the feed with real-world footage, showing Teslas navigating tight city blocks and reacting to opening car doors without panic. But it's still early. Just 10 cars, front-seat monitors still present, and a Texas law kicking in this September will require a state permit. Plus, Tesla's camera-and-AI-only approach (no lidar or radar) continues to raise red flags with safety advocates especially in fog, rain, or low sun..If the rally holds, Tesla inches back toward its $1 trillion crown. But the stock's still down 12% in 2024, as investors wrestle with slumping EV demand and the brand baggage of Musk's political takes. And at 149x forward earnings? It's priced more like a moonshot AI play than an automaker. Ford (NYSE:F) trades at 9.3x. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) sits at 31.6x.

But lately, the stock hasn’t been moving in step with its usual..At the heart of the issue was Elon Musk’s political fallout with Donald Trump. Things got messy after Musk criticized a congressional spending bill, which led the President to suggest Musk’s outrage stemmed from the bill axing EV tax credits. The noise wasn't just political, it affected the brand and stock alike..Tesla’s Q1 2025 results came in soft, and added fuel to Argus’ downgrade decision. Still, the firm expected Tesla to weather the global EV turbulence. The upcoming Model 2, Tesla’s promised budget option, along with AI ventures like Cybercab and the Optimus robot, may give the stock a lift, at-least in the short term..Yet Argus pointed to a persistent drag: Musk himself. His high-profile feuds and increasingly divisive public image are turning off portions of the market. Cybertrucks piling up without buyers is one indication of that..Even so, Argus stuck by its broader faith in Tesla’s future.

Musk boldly predicts Optimus will become “the biggest product of all time by far.”.Tesla bulls view robotics as crucial for future growth, while skeptics argue the company has abandoned its sustainable transportation mission for uncertain ventures, questioning whether robotics will deliver compared to focusing on affordable EVs with massive market potential..Out of the 41 analysts covering TSLA stock, 14 recommend “Strong Buy,” two recommend “Moderate Buy,” 15 recommend “Hold,” and 10 recommend “Strong Sell.” The average TSLA stock price target is $292, below the current price near $345.

But there were some bumps,Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi service began in Austin Texas for a select group of the company’s fans.,"Tesla’s much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company’s fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat..It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step..Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet..But the start of the Tesla service Sunday was only a fraction of any of that. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March..But the Austin test pressed on regardless..The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives’ team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday..Ives’ note to clients, which cited how a Tesla “safety monitor” sat in the front passenger seat while no person was in the driver’s seat, praised the quality of the rides taken by his team member..“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.”.But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. In one YouTube video, the robotaxi drove on the wrong side of the road after it attempted and abandoned a left turn, only to continue traveling down the street on the opposite side of a double yellow line before making the left turn on the following block. Fortunately, there were no vehicles driving on the other side of the road.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-finally-began-limited-version-162518514.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Yahoo! Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian joins us now on this and of course, guest contributor Jay Woods still with us. So Pras, did the event live up to the hype going into it? .I mean, I I'm looking at this stock move right now, up over 10%. I'm I was shocked because pre-market it was up a percent, a little bit like that. I wasn't huge gains today. I mean, look, it was a small test. 10 to 20 vehicles operating down in Austin. A lot of you seen a lot of videos of people Tesla fans, people like that who are able to get in on the test, tweeting about it, showing their Oh, one guy did 11 trips, he said yesterday, right? No no issues so far. But we, I mean, look, it's a it's a geo fence test, as safety operators, including a teleoperator too. So, uh, not exactly a full robo taxi sort of experience, but but apparently a successful launch yesterday. Uh, I got to ask about, you know, scale. How do you scale this business? That's a question that Dan Levy had like a great test today, but what happens down the line? So I think there's some issues there, but for Tesla Bulls and the stock right now, it's I'm surprised at the 10% move. .Yeah. And so Jay, as we think about that 10% move and how investors are reacting here, we know that for the animal spirits, there's typically a ton of bullishness within the Tesla name. However, we have seen some of the bears have their way with the stock over the year too, given Elon Musk's annexation to the White House, but now reinserting himself in a lot of the day-to-day operations at Tesla. .Yeah, I I'm surprised at this move too, up 10% and climbing. I look at it technically. If this breaks 365, you've got some smooth sailing ahead. Some of the things we haven't talked about is the de-escalation of the war of words between the president and Elon Musk himself. And then as you mentioned, astutely, you know, it was a limited number of rides in a strict area, and it was influencers in the back of the car. What are they going to say? They're they're you know, I don't know if they're paid influencers to go into these cars, but, uh, it was very optimistic, but I still sit back and say, Waymo is in eight cities and they don't have geo fencing. They're going slowly, smoothly along. They just lack the magnanimous leader that is Musk. So I think Musk himself, uh, showing that this is a success, a big step forward, much needed, and then de-escalating the war of words with Trump is really what's got investors excited. But to me, every time I talk negatively about this stock, I don't know. We should talk about this off air. Uh, the internet blows up. Uh, you're you're evil, and it it trades like a cult stock, and right now the cult is very happy. .Yeah, I think that you may have hit the nail on the head right there with the the Musk is back on his main quest, they say, right? He's no longer part of the government. He's he's strictly supposed to be devoted to Tesla and all his other companies, and that's probably a big part of enthusiasm. They they said they're going to launch it in 20 seconds. They actually did it. It's happening. Uh, but like you said, .What about the general public? When are we going to be allowed to do that?

TSLA shares are breaking out above multi-week highs and are up more than 6% in early trading as volume turnover is swelling and tracking to levels of more than 60% above the 50-day average volume..Image Source: TradingView.Silicon Valley legends like Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t get to where they are without massive risk-taking and a ‘move fast, break things’ approach. For instance, after Elon Musk scored his first $175 million fortune with the successful sale of PayPal (PYPL) to eBay (EBAY), he immediately began deploying most (but not all) of his capital to his new endeavors – SpaceX and Tesla. However, when the 2008 Global Financial Crisis hit, Musk was forced to risk all of his capital (and actually had to borrow money) to survive. The bet paid off, and the rest is history – Musk became the wealthiest person on Earth..Whether it’s X.com (formally Twitter) or SpaceX, Musk prefers to move at lightning speed and fix mistakes later. Nevertheless, Musk is wisely taking a measured approach with the robotaxi debut since the stakes are high. With global car sales slumping and Musk’s recent political, reputational damage, Tesla’s robotaxi service must move forward without a hitch. As a result, Tesla is debuting the robotaxi in a geo-fenced-in zone, charging a low fee of $4.20, and has a safety rider in the front passenger seat to ensure the debut goes smoothly. Thus far, investors are cheering the measured side of Elon Musk..The robotaxi launch is invite-only and includes social media personalities and investors. Tesla is using modified Model Y vehicles (the best-selling car currently) with updated software instead of the futuristic Cybercab concept Musk initially pitched. The move to use Model Ys was likely to avoid falling further behind Alphabet’s (GOOGL) rapidly expanding ‘Waymo’ robotaxi service. With Waymo already operating in Austin, investors will be watching to see which service clients choose once Tesla opens up its robotaxi service to the public..Between Musk’s controversies and slowing sales, TSLA still has its fair share of skeptics. For example, prominent short seller Jim Chanos is bearish on the company, citing valuation concerns and competition. However, these skeptics will likely have to eat their words if Musk and his Tesla team can scale its robotaxi service into 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-debuts-pivotal-moment-154300477.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The cars were accompanied by a “safety monitor” who did not sit in the driver’s seat, but did sit in the passenger seat..On the bullish side, the launch was held on time, there were no reports of mishaps with the rides, and it was “unsupervised” as technically there was no one at the steering wheel. For context, Tesla advises users to keep their hands on the steering wheel all the time while using its full self-driving technology (supervised) – the same technology that lays the foundation for the robotaxi. Wedbush analyst and long-time Tesla bull Dan Ives was among those who rode Tesla’s robotaxi and came back impressed, saying it exceeded his expectations..Tesla bears, too, have something to talk about, as it wasn’t “unsupervised” in a strict sense. Moreover, the company seems to have carefully vetted the initial set of passengers to avoid any negative feedback. While both Tesla bulls and bears can claim some victory after the robotaxi launch, the former camp seems to have an upper hand, which is also reflected in today’s price action..That said, by Musk’s assertion, the robotaxi service won’t move the needle for the company financially until next year. During the Q1 2025 earnings call, he “bet” that there would be “millions of Teslas operating autonomously” in the back half of 2026.

Photos and videos of the sleek, self-driving Model Y vehicles quickly surfaced across social media..Each car is equipped with Tesla's advanced Full Self-Driving software, powered by AI and a vision-based system. Unlike rivals that rely on lidar and radar, Tesla is doubling down on its camera-only approach..Despite earlier promises of true autonomy, a Tesla employee is currently seated in the passenger side to monitor rides. The driver's seat remains empty, but the vehicles are restricted to geo-fenced neighborhoods in Austin..CEO Elon Musk confirmed fewer than a dozen cars were deployed for the soft launch. The move comes just days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law requiring autonomous vehicles to receive state permits to operate without human drivers, putting Tesla on the clock, with a deadline looming Sept. 1..The pilot feels more like a preview than a breakthrough, but it could be an early sign Tesla's long-term autonomy vision is starting to take shape..Based on the one year price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average target price for Tesla Inc is $289.30 with a high estimate of $500.00 and a low estimate of $19.05. The average target implies a downside of -10.20% from the current price of $322.16..Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $267.12, suggesting a downside of -17.08% from the current price of $322.16..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-climbs-launching-exclusive-134337601.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The sharp decline was triggered by a public spat between TSLA CEO Elon Musk and President Trump..Musk publicly criticized the President's proposed tax and spending legislation, cheekily called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."".Among other things, the bill has implications for EV subsidies, which are vital to Tesla's business model. The bill would scale back numerous tax credits for the purchase and production of EVs, which also includes the $7,500 consumer credit. The bill would also eliminate tailpipe-emission rules that incentivize car manufacturers to electrify their up and upcoming models over the next decade..Musk, in addition to concerns over EV tax credits and personal attacks on the POTUS, also expressed concerns over the bill's ""potential to increase the national deficit by $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years."" The white house, on the other hand, has disputed the claim..POTUS, in response, threatened to cut off federal contracts with Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX..""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"".However, by the next day, the stock rebounded over 5%, and recovered some of the lost ground. The recovery was due to the reports suggesting a potential de-escalation between Musk and Trump, although the White House later denied any scheduled call..Despite the rebound, analysts remain cautious and noted that the feud could have long-term implications for Musk's companies with the federal government, especially regarding regulatory approvals for innovations like driverless robotaxis..While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Tesla, Inc.'s share was trading at $322.16 as of June 20th. TSLA’s trailing and forward P/E were 184.09 and 166.67, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance..A modern electric vehicle charging at an electric car station..Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report confirmed deep operational challenges, with revenue from its core electric vehicle business plunging 20% year-over-year and falling below 2023 levels. Operating income dropped by two-thirds, with the auto segment slipping into the red. Management has withheld forward guidance, citing uncertainties and transitional disruptions, including a Model Y production shift..Despite these bleak figures, Tesla’s stock has continued its meteoric rise, up 70% from a year ago, driven by investor faith in Elon Musk’s bold AI ambitions. Musk, pledging reduced political engagement and increased CEO focus, maintains Tesla should be viewed not as a carmaker but as a future leader in AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robotics. Tesla plans to launch a limited robotaxi trial in Austin by June with a small fleet of Model Ys aided by remote operators—an approach that resembles Waymo’s model but sans LIDAR, relying solely on cameras and AI..While Musk insists this is scalable, critics argue it's overly ambitious. Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot, is another linchpin in Musk’s vision, with plans for thousands in production by 2025 and over a million sold annually by 2030. However, component export restrictions and regulatory concerns cloud that timeline..Meanwhile, Tesla’s booming energy storage business grew 67% in Q1, though future tariffs may impact it. Valued at $800 billion, Tesla’s stock reflects massive belief in unproven technologies, with its traditional auto business possibly justifying 10% of that figure. Skeptics now expect full-year losses, and short positions are growing. Yet, Musk’s unpredictability means anything—from flying cybercabs to MAGA drones—could reshape the narrative again..Previously we covered a bearish thesis on Tesla, Inc. by Stefan Waldhauser in February 2025, which highlighted brand erosion, internal talent issues, and overreliance on speculative AI promises.

That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

2025-06-23 22:17:00,"Tesla robotaxi finally launches but hiccups include long wait times, Pokemon-style hunts for the car, and even driving in wrong lane","While Tesla attempted to minimize risks in part by inviting out-of-town influencers from the Tesla community, there were some issues.","Elon Musk’s company celebrated its first day officially ferrying passengers through the Texan capital of Austin. While Tesla attempted to minimize risks in part by inviting out-of-town influencers from the Tesla community, there were some issues. “Obviously we’re on the wrong side of the double yellow lines here,” said one rider..For many Tesla investors, Sunday’s launch of its robotaxi pilot in Texas represented a historic day. After years of bold promises, Elon Musk’s company finally began ferrying passengers on their own without a human directly behind the wheel..While the first impressions were heavily positive, that should come as little surprise. The selection of passengers for the invite-only test skewed toward Tesla bulls, including Dan Ives. The Wedbush tech analyst argues the stock should be worth double its current $1 trillion market value, and currently recommends it as a buy with a $500 price target..“Overall, these Robotaxis exceeded our expectations and offered a seamless and personalized travel experience that has lit the spark for autonomous driving,” Ives told his clients in a research note on Sunday, summing up his experience as “very impressive.”.On the one hand, the day marked a historic milestone for Tesla, whose shares are set to open 1.7% higher in a flat market..For the very first time, a manufacturer heavily reliant on hardware sales—the delivery of electric vehicles—demonstrated it was on the path to becoming a company that one day could earn a substantial share of its profits from high-margin software and services..Nevertheless, it wasn’t anywhere near the “ChatGPT moment” the Tesla CEO has promised for the past two years..No switch was flipped that suddenly made millions of Tesla vehicles capable of driving themselves without human supervision, as Musk has prophesied..Instead rides were limited largely to a number of prominent Tesla-friendly influencers, most of whom had traveled from out-of-town to Austin just to participate in the launch..The exact number of cars participating in the pilot on Sunday is unknown. Musk indicated he initially wanted only around a dozen or so to mitigate the risk and ensure maximum safety..Tesla employees serving as safety monitors were seated at all times in the front passenger seat, though it was unclear what influence they had, if any, over the vehicle or whether the vehicle was, at times, being tele-operated remotely..Since the rides were geofenced to an area of southern Austin, the trips charged for the symbolic price of $4.20 each (a marijuana reference Musk often uses) tended to be short. Two livestreams by Tesla promoters Farzad Mesbahi and Sawyer Merritt were just five and three minutes in length, respectively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-finally-launches-hiccups-141739683.html,@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
