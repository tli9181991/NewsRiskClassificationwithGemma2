2025-06-26 18:37:00,Meta’s quest to dominate the AI world,Meta is on a quest to dominate the AI world. One way or another.,"Facebook parent Meta (META) is spending billions of dollars to grab the lead in the AI race, building out the data centers needed to develop and power high-end large language models. And now, the company is pouring billions more into snatching up top talent and technologies to grab the lead in the AI wars..In its latest hiring coup, Meta has poached three OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) researchers — Google DeepMind alums Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — from its Zurich office, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has offered the company's employees upward of $100 million to join his AI efforts..Meanwhile, Meta is reportedly in talks to bag Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross and former Github CEO Nat Friedman for its planned superintelligence lab. Zuckerberg was initially eyeing all of Safe Superintelligence, but was shot down by co-founder Ilya Sutskever, according to CNBC..The moves come after Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI startup Scale AI and hired its CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang. That’s not all: Meta also wanted to buy Perplexity AI (PEAI.PVT) but couldn’t come to terms on a deal..“Meta is doing this because they want to win the AI race, period,” Forrester analyst Mike Proulx told Yahoo Finance. “AI is everything right now.”.All of this follows Meta’s decision to postpone the debut of its massive Llama 4 Behemoth AI model. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company won’t launch the model until later this fall over concerns that it isn’t a big enough upgrade over prior models..“I think this is two things: No. 1 [is] confirmation that Llama is struggling,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “And second, is [it’s] also a sign that Zuckerberg is not OK with that.”.For Meta, the goal is clear: bring in as much fresh talent as possible to push its AI program forward and take the lead in the AI wars..Meta’s effort to rule the AI world differs from its chief rivals, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. Rather than closing off its AI models, the company offers them as open-source software that developers and companies can use on their own..Meta imposes some restrictions on how users can take advantage of its models. For instance, the company requires firms to request a license from Meta if their product has more than 700 million monthly active users..Regardless, Meta’s ultimate goal is to get as many people as it’s comfortable with using and developing products via its AI models. Why not charge everyone who wants to access its software? Because Meta benefits every time a company alters its models, giving it greater insights into how it can improve them down the line.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-quest-to-dominate-the-ai-world-184836143.html," The article reflects a high-risk scenario.

The news, which was expected, arrived just in time to meet the deadline of June 26, after which the iPhone maker would risk new fines. The changes involve both how app developers can communicate with their customers and the fees Apple charges..EU regulators had earlier fined Apple €500 million for noncompliance with the DMA and were threatening to impose further penalties, forcing Apple’s hand..In terms of Apple’s new “anti-steering” rules, which dictate customer communications, EU app developers will now be able to link to alternative ways to pay for subscriptions and other in-app purchases outside the App Store across any channel. That means they can share this link on a website, an alternative app marketplace, within another app, and more. These links can also be accessed outside the app or within the app using a web view or native experience, Apple said, and don’t have to use warning screens or the text that Apple previously required..In addition, instead of dropping its Core Technology Fee (CTF), Apple introduced a more complex fee structure..There’s now an initial acquisition fee (2%) and a store services fee. The latter is either 13% or 5%, depending on the tier the developer chooses. (Small Business program members pay 10%.) Tier 1 developers have access to a more limited set of App Store services, including app reviews, manual updates, and antifraud measures. Tier 2 provides access to marketing tools, automatic updates, curation and personalization features, app insights, and more..Then, for apps that want to link to alternative methods of payment via the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement (EU) Addendum, there’s a Core Technology Commission (CTC). This will ultimately replace the CTF..Before today, the developers paid the CTF of €0.50 for each app install after the app topped 1 million downloads. That will continue for developers on the alternative EU business terms..For developers on the standard terms in the EU, the CTC — a 5% commission — will instead apply. Developers who currently pay the old CTF will move to the new rules by January 1, 2026..“The CTC reflects the value Apple provides developers through ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users,” Apple said in a statement..Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company sued Apple and won the right to use alternative payments without a commission in the U.S., reacted to the news on X, calling it more malicious compliance from Apple..“Apple’s new Digital Markets Act malicious compliance scheme is blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States and makes a mockery of fair competition in digital markets.

Overall, while the news introduces product upgrades and sales tactics, these strategies are likely to enhance rather than mitigate financial risk for MAGEASY."

Rather than being driven by innovation ormeaningful expansion, its stock performance has leaned heavily on financialengineering, primarily being propped up through aggressive share buybacks..While Tim Cook's capital allocation strategy has been highlyeffective, the benefit of buybacks diminishes when shares are richly priced,the fundamental issue with buybacks in this case is 1. They rely on valuationsbeing low enough to act as accretive to earnings (they no longer are at roughly 200 a share) 2. They maskunderlying issues fundamental to the company by propping up the order bookwithout real underlying demand.

2025-06-26 22:17:00,SoundHound AI vs. Cerence: Which Voice AI Stock Holds More Promise?,"SOUN and CRNC battle for voice AI dominance, but only one is scaling fast across sectors beyond autos with strong momentum.","Voice-driven artificial intelligence is emerging as a key battleground in tech, and SoundHound AI, Inc. SOUN and Cerence Inc. CRNC have positioned themselves at the forefront of this niche. SoundHound is a newer entrant leveraging its conversational voice platform across industries from automotive to restaurants, while Cerence is an established leader in in-car voice assistants for automakers. Both companies operate in the voice AI space, and a comparison is timely as generative AI amplifies demand for voice interfaces.Despite their common focus on voice AI, SoundHound and Cerence differ in scope and strategy. SoundHound’s technology spans multiple industries, powering voice ordering in restaurants and voice-enabled customer service, in addition to automotive voice assistants. In contrast, Cerence is focused on the mobility market, supplying voice assistant software to nearly every major car OEM. The broader market reach of SoundHound compared to Cerence’s auto specialization sets the stage for an intriguing comparison. Let’s analyze which voice AI stock offers better upside potential now..SoundHound has emerged as a leader in voice AI by combining advanced speech recognition with large language models to power natural, voice-based interactions. Its Polaris AI engine delivers fast, accurate responses — even in noisy settings — supporting applications across industries. The company’s acquisitions of SYNQ3, Amelia and Allset have expanded its capabilities in restaurant ordering, customer service and voice commerce. Now operating with a three-pronged strategy — enterprise agents, automotive assistants and voice commerce —SoundHound is gaining traction among automakers and tech firms. Its innovation pace and platform versatility position it as a strong independent player in the voice AI space.SoundHound’s broad industry reach opens up significant growth potential. It’s gaining traction in restaurants, with voice ordering in nearly 13,000 locations, and in automotive, powering voice AI for more than 20 car brands. Its enterprise solutions are used by top global banks, reflecting strong B2B adoption. This diversification limits dependence on any single customer. As generative AI demand grows, SoundHound’s independent, brand-friendly platform appeals to companies wary of Big Tech. Partnerships with firms like Lucid Motors and NVIDIA extend its footprint into luxury EVs and edge AI. Overall, SoundHound is well-positioned to scale across multiple high-growth sectors.SoundHound’s first-quarter 2025 results highlight strong momentum, with revenues surging 151% year over year to $29.1 million, driven by organic growth and recent acquisitions. Key contributions came from restaurant and enterprise voice AI solutions, supporting diversification. While the GAAP gross margin fell to 37% due to integration costs, the adjusted gross margin stood at 51%, with management targeting margin improvements over the next 18 to 24 months. The company posted a non-GAAP net loss of $22.3 million but remains well-capitalized, holding $246 million in cash and no debt. The full-year revenue guidance of $157-$177 million implies a near doubling, and SoundHound is targeting adjusted EBITDA breakeven by year-end, signaling a focus on scaling efficiently toward profitability.Despite operational momentum, SoundHound faces formidable competition from deep-pocketed tech giants. Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL dominate the AI-powered voice assistant market. Google Assistant powers Android Automotive and is well integrated into in-car experiences globally. Amazon’s Alexa, backed by AWS and a large developer community, is expanding into vehicles and has an entrenched smart home base. Apple’s Siri benefits from tight integration across its ecosystem, especially via iPhones and CarPlay. These larger players — Alphabet, Amazon and Apple — could leverage their ecosystems to challenge SoundHound’s growth. Another risk is the company’s heavy spend on R&D and marketing (up 66% year over year due to acquisitions), which must eventually translate into sustainable customer wins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhound-ai-vs-cerence-voice-141700782.html," The news concerning SoundHound AI (SOUN) and Cerence (CRNC) involves several key risks:  1. **High Competition in Tech Space**: The battle for dominance in voice AI could lead to resource competition among companies, potentially causing market saturation and price pressures affecting stock prices.  2. **Market Share Concentration**: A significant shift towards one company might result in high concentration risk, making it vulnerable to changes or new entrants.  3. **Operational Challenges from Rapid Growth**: Scaling quickly without adequate infrastructure could lead to operational issues such as supply chain problems or increased costs.  4. **Regulatory Risks**: The expansion into regulated areas like data privacy could expose companies to legal challenges, fines, or reputational damage.  5. **Uncertain Competitive Landscape**: Market shifts and competitive responses could cause further uncertainties affecting both companies' growth trajectories.  Therefore, the risk classification includes competition risks, market concentration, operational risks, regulatory risks, and competitive uncertainty."

He articulated this struggle recently, saying “at some point we ran this calculation and we're like 'alright, if we were able to do all the things we thought were good, between the additional engagement and usage of our apps and the random taxes and stuff, I think we might be twice as profitable as a company as we are now.”.This statement reflects Zuckerberg’s longstanding frustration with platform dependencies, particularly Apple’s (AAPL) iOS ecosystem, which he argues restricts Meta’s innovation and revenue potential. Apple’s control over app distribution — including its 30% fee on in-app purchases and restrictions on features — directly impacts Meta’s bottom line. For instance, he claims Apple’s limitations on tracking and advertising tools have cost Meta billions in lost ad revenue.

Under his direction, Meta has navigated multiple technological shifts — from desktop to mobile, and now toward AI and mixed reality — while maintaining a user base exceeding 3 billion people. His critique of Apple is not merely rhetorical; it aligns with Meta’s aggressive investments in alternative platforms, such as VR headsets and AR glasses, designed to reduce reliance on rivals’ ecosystems..The tension between Meta and Apple extends beyond financials to fundamental values. Zuckerberg champions “open platforms” where third-party developers innovate freely, contrasting sharply with Apple’s “walled garden” approach. This philosophical divide has intensified as both companies compete in mixed reality. While Apple’s Vision Pro targets a premium market, Meta’s Quest headsets prioritize affordability and accessibility, with Zuckerberg declaring them “better and 10 times cheaper.” This divergence underscores a broader strategic clash: Apple leverages its integrated hardware-software model, while Meta bets on democratizing access to capture mass adoption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/might-twice-profitable-company-now-120002721.html, The news relates to **strategic risk**.

2025-06-26 17:30:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030,"Amazon's operating income growth is a vital metric.  Alphabet is drastically undervalued for its performance.  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position.","Apple's stock trades at a premium valuation despite putting up slow growth..Amazon's operating income growth is a vital metric..Alphabet is drastically undervalued for its performance..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the defining stock of the late 2010s and into the early 2020s, but time is up for its leadership position. Although it's still the third-largest company in the world, Microsoft and Nvidia have overtaken Apple, likely for good, as the growth these two are putting up far surpasses Apple's..However, I don't think we've seen the last of companies surpassing Apple in terms of market cap over the next few years. I think we'll see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surpass Apple by 2030. Several key factors play into this prediction, but Amazon's and Alphabet's performances aren't the only reason they'll surpass Apple..Apple's brand may be the most valuable on Earth, but that's about all it has going for it. Apple has posted anemic growth over the past few years, and it could be debated that Apple's growth has been essentially nonexistent when inflation is factored into the calculation..Despite that, Apple's stock trades like a hot growth stock, trading at 28 times forward earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 22.8 times forward earnings, with an average growth rate of about 10% per year. Apple's growth rate is far below that pace, so at most, Apple's stock should receive a market-average multiple, at least from my perspective..If Apple's valuation were to decline to a market-average multiple, it would tumble nearly 20%. That would put Apple's market cap at around $2.44 trillion, which is where we'll start our comparison..Currently, Amazon's market cap is $2.23 trillion and Alphabet's is $2.03 trillion. That's not far from the $2.44 trillion that I think Apple should be trading at, but even if Apple's stock stays at its elevated level, I think these two can catch Apple by 2030..Let's start with Amazon, whose growth rate looks rather slow at first glance, similar to Apple's..However, that's the wrong way to look at Amazon's stock. Amazon can be split into two businesses: commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing. While the consumer-facing commerce division is widely known and what most people value the stock for, the real cash cow is AWS. In the first quarter, AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating profits despite making up just 19% of revenue. Furthermore, AWS's operating income rose 23% year over year in Q1.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-worth-more-093000400.html, No risk.

It’s the third such deal since 2024, and by far the largest. They occurred during periods when the Taiwan dollar tended to appreciate. The moves grant TSMC Global — the vehicle responsible for managing overseas investments and hedging — more capital flexibility in managing exchange rate risks..The capital injection is for general investments, mainly bank deposits and bonds, according to a separate statement from Taiwan’s Department of Investment Review. The purpose was for TSMC to shift its own foreign exchange holdings to the unit to help with hedging costs, the statement said..Recent strength in the Taiwan dollar has caused worries in Taipei about the economy’s heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency notched its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, spurring calls from the central bank to curb speculation. The cost of hedging swings has surged this year, with one-year implied volatility for the local currency hitting the highest since 2011 on Wednesday..“Generally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,” said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco based in Singapore. “Issuing new shares, and bringing in an immediate cash injection, may help companies manage the margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.”.“The US dollar cash can also be useful for companies’ overseas operations, which could also require consistent hedging,” McNicholas added..TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far the island’s biggest company and exporter because the majority of its production is domestic. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would translate into less of the local currency, or they would need to raise their prices overseas and risk denting demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html, The news article about TSMC injecting $10 billion into its overseas unit relates primarily to **Currency Exchange Rate Volatility Risk**.

That combined ecosystem is what some investors are saying will cement its place as a leader in China’s trillion-dollar tech sector..The new offering “not only gives Xiaomi business exposure in the fast growing EV business in China, but more importantly the synergy,” said June Lui, a portfolio manager at Polen Capital. “Globally, there is no one company that can connect your mobile device, your home appliances and your car — and they have all three.”.Over the past 12 months, Xiaomi’s shares have more than tripled, topping a gauge of peers as it leverages its smartphone success into China’s crowded EV market..The rally, which stands out even amid the renaissance in China tech thanks to DeepSeek’s breakthrough, has made Xiaomi one of the country’s most expensive tech stocks. Shares are now trading at nearly 30 times forward earnings, almost double the valuation of Tencent Holdings Ltd. (TCTZF) and even above US giant Apple Inc. (AAPL)..Still, overwhelmingly bullish sell-side analysts hope its sportier and more premium second EV will help Xiaomi capture a new customer segment and drive the stock even higher. Order momentum for the YU7 is also key for boosting production scale, which is critical for improving unit economics in the auto business..Pricing estimates by analysts for the YU7 range from 250,000 yuan ($34,900) to 330,000 yuan. In comparison, Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y starts from 263,500 yuan while the electric version of BYD's (BYDDY, BYDDF) Tang L SUV, which is just slightly smaller than the YU7, sells for between 239,800 and 289,800 yuan.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-xiaomi-launch-first-suv-220000720.html," The article discusses Xiaomi launching its first electric SUV as their shares are near a record high. The potential risks associated with this news fall under the **automotive sector**. Specifically:  - **Market Volatility**: The automotive industry can be volatile, and a significant product launch like an electric SUV could impact Xiaomi's stock performance. - **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in Chinese regulations affecting electric vehicle production or costs could influence Xiaomi's business operations and profitability. - **Competitive Pressure**: Increased competition from other automakers investing in EVs may put pressure on Xiaomi to maintain its market share and innovation.  **Result:** The risk is classified under the automotive sector."

The company is facing weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, which remains a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are also a concern for investors. Nevertheless, Apple is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, is helping Apple sell more of its devices, including iPhone.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)AMD’s shares have gained +17.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s gain of +28%. The company is benefiting from robust Data Center and Client revenues that fully offset sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Data centers are benefiting from solid adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises.New product launches, such as the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D and Radeon 9070 series, have been major growth drivers. Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD’s expanding partner base, including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AMD is also expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. However, AMD has been suffering from stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA. Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)Shares of Applied Materials have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+12.6% vs. +11.3%). The company is benefiting from strength in Semiconductor Systems, owing to a rebound in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the foundry logic space. Consistent progress in the services is aiding Applied Global Services’ performance. Solid momentum in the subscription and display businesses is a plus. Its strength in IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors (ICAPS) is likely to continue aiding its position in the semiconductor industry. Its diversified portfolio remains its key growth driver. Our model estimate indicates revenues will witness a CAGR of 5.7% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, increasing U.S.-China tensions and export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment may undermine its near-term growth prospects.

This microcap company with a market capitalization of $99.29 million is witnessing declines in casino revenue, equity investment losses and compressed EBITDA margins signal near-term risks. Real estate exposure and underperforming pari-mutuel operations may weigh on profitability.Nevertheless, Canterbury Park presents a compelling long-term opportunity, driven by diversified real estate developments, including more than 1,000 residential units, commercial venues and upcoming projects across 50 acres at Canterbury Commons. Strategic joint ventures like Trackside Investments are monetizing land while retaining recurring income streams. Canterbury Park is expanding event-driven revenues amid casino headwinds, achieving 9.3% year-over-year growth in non-gaming segments.

With more than 50 standards and strong client retention, WFCF holds a defensible market position. Tech-enabled audits drive scalability and efficiency, supporting margin stability. However, its core cattle verification business faces long-term pressure from a prolonged herd contraction, weighing on revenues.

Once a day, at a random time, users were prompted to post a picture of whatever they were doing. With a two-minute timer and one shot to make it count, the app’s premise was to capture real moments in real time..But like most viral sensations, the novelty wore off.

The time to buy this beaten-down stock could be now..Nike faces several challenges after some recent missteps by the company. The company is criticised for its lack of innovation and overreliance on popular legacy sneakers. Meanwhile, competition in the space is fierce. According to CEO Elliott Hill, product innovation is a major priority now. The company will reduce the inventory of its older models and introduce new products. One example is the high-performance Pagasus Premium shoe for runners. The initiative will be a challenge as Nike needs to create new products that sneaker lovers will gravitate to and market them effectively. Fortunately, Nike has extensive experience and a strong, long-term track record of success..Nike also overemphasized selling directly to consumers while neglecting retail partnerships. This reduced visibility and connection with customers. The consensus is that Nike vastly underestimated the value of retail shops. The CEO emphasized on the most recent earnings call that the company is reconnecting with its wholesalers, which should be a huge positive in the future..Nike produces a significant portion of its products in China, and the country is also a key market in which the company aims to expand its sales. Unfortunately, tariffs and geopolitical angst hurt costs and sales.

Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms each have market capitalizations of more than $1 trillion, and tend to dominate their markets and investors' attention..Don't get me wrong: All of those are solid investments. But it's also a good strategy for tech investors to look elsewhere for new opportunities. After all, companies like Palantir Technologies were barely a blip on the radar just a few years ago. But Palantir's dynamic growth (showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others..The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems. And each has a market cap of less than $100 billion -- which means there's plenty of room for further growth and profit for your portfolio..DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) got its start in 2013, but it's one of those companies that really took off during the pandemic, as people were much more interested in eating at home than venturing out. That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives..The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns..DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms..If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE).

The company's vast resources give Apple many of options for diversifying and growing its business.","Apple iPhones are used by more than 1 billion customers around the world..Sales of iPhones, however, have been stagnant and growth has been virtually non existent in recent years..The company's vast resources give Apple many of options for diversifying and growing its business..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.It seems like ages ago when BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) was the big name in tech and whose cellphones were in hot demand. But as more innovative technologies emerged and better phones captivated consumers, the company struggled. Today, it has pivoted to focusing on enterprise software and cybersecurity..The tech company whose phones were responsible for taking significant market share from BlackBerry was Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Its iPhones soared in popularity when they first became available, 18 years ago. Lately, however, iPhones no longer look to be cutting-edge phones as the company's rollout of new artificial intelligence (AI) features has been delayed until next year. If Apple doesn't fix this situation soon, could it risk following the same path as BlackBerry?.Apple has delayed the rollout of some AI features for its iPhones, specifically to do with its Siri assistant. And that has many investors worried that rather than leading the way in AI innovation, it's playing catch up. AI capabilities are constantly evolving and the danger is that by the time Apple releases all of its AI features, there could be new ones available on rival devices..While Apple has a large user base and there are around 1.4 billion iPhone users in the world, the company hasn't been seeing a wave of upgrades as consumers are seeing less of a reason to buy a new phone. In the company's most recent fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 28, 2024, iPhone sales totaled $201.2 billion and were flat from the previous year. And when compared to two years ago, their sales were down by a little more than 2%..Demand doesn't look to be all that strong right now. The big question is when it comes time to finally upgrade a device, if Apple users will stick with the iPhone, or if there will be a temptation to leave to another company, whose phones may come equipped with more advanced capabilities..Apple may appear to be falling behind in AI, but that doesn't mean the business is doomed. The biggest reason why Apple may not end up being the next BlackBerry is due to one simple reason: its impressive financials. When in doubt, Apple can acquire a company or invest in a technology to bolster its growth prospects, as it has the vast financial resources to do so.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-next-blackberry-083500489.html, The news reflects a FINANCIAL RISK.

The stock is trading below the $200 mark—about 25% off its all-time highs—making it the worst performer among the top seven tech stocks right now. This is a sharp contrast to the 22% total annualized returns Apple has delivered to shareholders over the past decade..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.While the recent bearishness isn’t entirely unjustified — higher import fees are putting pressure on Apple’s product margins, and sticky interest rates continue to weigh on consumer spending — I don’t believe the stock is doomed for an extended correction. Historically, Apple has proven to be a great stock to own during periods of relative weakness like this, especially when valuations reset to more reasonable levels..That said, when it comes to high-quality stocks like AAPL, buying just because momentum looks weak isn’t always the best strategy. For now, until the trends start to improve, I remain Neutral on AAPL stock..Among the Magnificent 7 stocks, Apple’s recent performance clearly reflects that markets view the company’s thesis as one of the most fragile, mainly due to growing concerns around the ongoing trade war..The possibility of new tariffs on imported products resurfaced after the U.S. president threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. No doubt, this would be a blow to Apple’s bullish case. Growth estimates are likely to be revised downward for the coming quarters—and possibly even years. However, if we step back and look at the bigger picture, these fears might actually be somewhat exaggerated, as TipRanks’ risk analysis shows..For one, history shows that tariff threats are often more a political negotiation tool than something that is actually enforced. Additionally, under the highly efficient leadership of CEO Tim Cook, Apple has consistently demonstrated its ability to navigate supply chain challenges. We saw this play out back in 2018-2019, during Trump’s first administration, when the U.S.-China trade war intensified. Apple responded quickly by expanding its production outside of China, significantly reducing its reliance on the country..Approximately 75% of Apple’s revenue still comes from hardware, which is more susceptible to tariff risks. But here’s the other side of the coin: Apple’s services segment has grown massively and now accounts for around 40% of operating profit. This part of the business—driven by recurring revenue streams like the App Store and licensing deals (think Google) — is far less exposed to trade war impacts. In fact, I believe the services business is still underrated by the market and remains one of Apple’s most powerful growth engines today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-investors-reconsider-buying-dip-013000759.html," The risk associated with the news about Apple's stock performance in 2025 can be classified as **moderate** due to several factors:  1. **Declining Stock Price**: Apple's stock is trading below $200, a significant drop from its historical highs, indicating potential short-term volatility and reduced investor confidence.  2. **Profitability Challenges**: Higher import fees could impose pressure on Apple's margins, affecting its profitability. This factor might be concentrated in specific regions, leading to margin pressures that could persist if widespread.  3. **Economic Factors**: Sticky interest rates may influence consumer spending, particularly for high-end products like iPhones, potentially impacting demand and thus Apple's revenue and profits.  4. **Market Sentiment and Sector Impact**: The dip may reflect short-term factors while also signaling broader concerns within the tech sector, which could affect investor sentiment and market dynamics.  5. **Long-term Business Model Concerns**: If these challenges are structural or long-term, they could have implications beyond the current year, affecting future performance and sustainability of profits.  6. **Investor Reactions**: Potential selling pressure on Apple stock due to the news may lead to increased market volatility, adding another layer of risk related to market impact.  In conclusion, while there are moderate risks tied to short-term factors like import duties and interest rates, they do not necessarily indicate a fundamental shift in Apple's business model. However, investors should remain cautious as these issues could potentially have long-term consequences."

Currently, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) still the default, and lock down some top AI talent before someone else snaps them up. Plus, tighter integration between on-device smarts and cloud AI could unlock new ways to bundle hardware and servicesthink of it as Siri finally earning its keep..But don't get too excited just yet. Merging two companies is always messy: there's integration risk, you've got to keep the Perplexity team happy, and regulators might squint hard at any deal that edges Apple further into search..And even if everything goes smoothly, users still have to actually switch over to the new, souped-up Siri. Worst case, Apple pays up but sees only a trickle of new ad revenue if default-search deals with Google stay intact..At the end of the day, Mohan thinks any sign that Apple's shedding its AI laggard rep would be a mood booster for the stock. A full buyout might give more of a valuation bump than a simple partnership, but either move would signal that Cupertino's serious about catching up in the voice-assistant and search wars..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ai-gambit-under-microscope-203331464.html," The news about Apple's AI Gambit involves several financial risks:  1. **Regulatory Risks**: Potential oversight and transparency requirements could impact their business model. 2. **Competition Risks**: Inadequate performance against established tech giants and startups might create a competitive disadvantage. 3. **Technology Risks**: Negative reception or innovation setbacks could harm adoption rates. 4. **Revenue Fluctuations**: Success of the deal affects hardware sales and profit margins, while failure could reduce revenue streams. 5. **Intellectual Property Risks**: Patent issues from groundbreaking technology could lead to legal battles. 6. **Market Share Risks**: Success might boost market share, while failure could lead to a loss in competitive position. 7. **Operational Risks**: Integration challenges and operational hurdles could affect performance.

META’s trailing and forward P/E were 27.46 and 27.78 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..A marketing manager in a boardroom making decisions about the company's social media management platform..Meta’s dramatic fall from grace in 2022, with its market cap plunging from nearly $1 trillion to just $230 billion, was driven by a confluence of cyclical and secular challenges. Internally, Meta reported its first-ever drop in daily active users and doubled down on a costly, uncertain Metaverse pivot, pouring nearly $30 billion into Reality Labs with little return..Externally, Apple’s iOS privacy changes slashed Meta’s ad targeting ability, costing an estimated $10 billion in lost ad revenue, while competition from TikTok siphoned user engagement. Macro conditions further compounded these issues, as rising interest rates and recession fears pressured advertisers and drove investors toward safer assets. Revenue declined 1% and net income fell 41% in 2022, but even in this difficult environment, Meta’s core business remained robust..The Family of Apps delivered a 37% operating margin on $114.5 billion in revenue, supported by a fortress balance sheet with $30 billion in net cash and $27.9 billion in buybacks. While the capital allocation into the Metaverse raised concerns, Zuckerberg’s strategic pivot in late 2022 marked a turning point.

The feature was previously available on Chrome for iOS, following Apple’s lead in the space..Having learned from Apple’s prior challenges, Google is not forcing the change on all its users, however. Instead, it’s adding a new feature that lets users configure the address bar’s location to their liking..To move the address bar to the bottom of the screen, long-press on the bar and then select the option to move it to the bottom. You can also configure the location of the address bar in Chrome’s Settings menu..Users often prefer this option, as it places the address bar closer to where they’re holding their phone, allowing them to type more comfortably..When Apple first rolled out the update, some users rebelled against the change, complaining that the placement of the bar, which initially floated atop the page’s content, was problematic as it made some websites nearly unusable. The bar would block out various elements that users needed to tap on, they said, which required them to swipe the bar down and out of the way. Others simply didn’t like the change..In response to user feedback, Apple moved the bar to the bottom, below the page content, and made it an optional choice as opposed to the default..Google is approaching the design update in the same way by allowing users to make the decision..The company said the feature will begin to appear on Android devices starting today and will roll out to all users over the weeks ahead.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chrome-android-now-lets-move-170000880.html, The news about Chrome for Android allows users to move the address bar to the bottom is classified as **Low Risk**.
2025-06-25 00:32:00,Apple cofounder Ronald Wayne sold his 10% stake for $800 in 1976—today it’d be worth up to $300 billion,"Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are often known as the brains behind the $3 trillion tech giant, Apple, but the company’s original third cofounder sold out early for just $800.","Apple’s little-known third cofounder, Ronald Wayne, was originally given a 10% stake in the now $3 trillion computer company. He cashed out just 12 days after Apple’s inception for $800 and said at the time he had no regrets. Today, his stake would be worth billions..In some history books, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are known as the two college dropouts-turned-geniuses who founded the Apple Computer Company in 1976. However, for the first 12 days of the business’s existence, there was a lesser-known third cofounder who played a critical role in getting the company off the ground..At the time, Ronald Wayne was in his forties working at the electronics company Atari. As a close friend of Jobs, he agreed to help convince Wozniak to formalize Apple’s launch. As the sense-maker of the group, who even typed up the contract, Wayne was given a 10% share in the tech company, while Jobs and Wozniak each got a 45% stake..But less than two weeks after the ink had dried, Wayne had removed himself from the contract—a decision that might be one of the biggest missed financial opportunities in history..While Wayne sold his stake for $800 at the time and later received $1,500 to forfeit any claim to the company, his 10% share could now be worth between $75 billion and $300 billion, thanks to the company’s now $3 trillion market cap..As new investors came on board and the company went public, the ownership stakes of Jobs and Wozniak were diluted over time—an outcome Ronald Wayne likely would have faced too..Wayne’s decision to cash out may look foolish in hindsight, but in the moment, the then 41-year-old believed he was looking out for his own financial wellbeing..In the company’s first days, Jobs borrowed $15,000 to complete a purchase order of “50 or 100 computers” from the Byte Shop, a retail outlet that had a history of not paying its bills, Wayne recalled to Business Insider in 2017..“If we didn’t get paid, how are we going to pay back $15,000?” he said..“Jobs and Woz didn’t have two nickels to rub together. I, on the other hand, had a house, and a car, and a bank account—which meant that I was on the hook if that thing blew up.”.Perhaps surprisingly, finances were not the only reason Wayne took his name off the contract. He also feared the experience would put the nails in the coffin of his career. After all, Jobs and Woz were bright young stars and nearly half his age at the time. Wayne thought that meant they’d be propelled forwards, while he’d have to watch from the sidelines.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-cofounder-ronald-wayne-sold-163245074.html, No risk.

Specifically, Zuckerberg explained how these companies often restrict Meta’s ability to innovate within their ecosystems, citing Apple’s iMessage as a powerful “lock-in” that discourages users from switching platforms. This competitive environment has influenced Meta’s decision to invest heavily and early in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, even before the market is fully mature..Zuckerberg says the strategy is actually working, as shown by the latest release of Apple Vision Pro, which largely failed due to its poor design, $3,500 price tag, and lack of relevant features or utility. Zuck touted this win, saying “our VR products are better and 10 times cheaper than Apple.”.Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Says the Technology They’re Developing Will ‘See What You See and Hear What You Hear’.The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..'Record-Shattering': Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Has Now Paid $101 Billion in Cumulative Federal Income Tax.Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox.

His vision for the “metaverse” — a persistent, shared virtual space — has driven Meta’s substantial investments in VR and AR, despite significant financial losses in Reality Labs, which have exceeded $60 billion since 2020..Zuckerberg’s assertion about Meta’s VR products being superior and more affordable than Apple’s fits within his broader strategy to democratize access to emerging technologies.

HSBC expects Broadcom to have up to seven ASIC customers by FY27, compared with just three at Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and one at Alchip..Concerns around Apple’s in-sourcing of wireless chips have also eased. HSBC now projects that 88% of Apple products will still use Broadcom-designed parts in FY26, leading the bank to revise its wireless revenue forecasts higher and bring them in line with consensus..Similarly, VMware revenue growth is expected to remain intact through FY26, as customer transitions to subscription models continue..“Broadcom continues to move VMware customers to subscription models for another 18 months at least so we do not expect any imminent slowdown,” Lee points out..With respect to valuation, HSBC assigns a 32x target price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for FY27, reflecting a 10% premium to Broadcom’s peak historical P/E over the past three years..“The ASIC revenue opportunity can drive upside and help re-rate the stock towards a new peak P/E,” the bank said. “With an implied upside to our TP of 58%, we upgrade the stock to a Buy (from Hold).”.Related articles.Broadcom shares jump as HSBC lifts stock to Buy on underestimated ASIC potential",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-shares-jump-hsbc-lifts-144326093.html, No risk.

It’s brought together industry lobbies from the Crypto Council for Innovation to the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Even Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are finding common cause, along with predictable parts of the tech sector including chipmakers and wireless providers..The reason is that chips are now in almost everything: refrigerators and microwaves, tire pressure sensors and navigation systems, electronic bidets and sonar equipment and, of course, smartphones and computers. Tariffs threaten to snarl supply lines and jack up costs for consumers..“There’s a large mismatch between the amount of chips we use in this country in various products and the supply created here in the US,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview. “Putting a tax on those imports will simply raise the cost, and that’s not a good thing for consumers.”.Case in point is the marine association, which warns the impact would be felt by more than 1,300 manufacturers who face higher expenses for essentials like propulsion technology, engines and GPS systems..“These systems are not optional luxuries — they are fundamental to safety, function and performance,” the association said. “Many components have no US equivalent or are only available from highly concentrated suppliers overseas.”.The boating sector’s concerns were among comments from 154 stakeholders submitted to a Commerce Department review of whether to slap tariffs on chips as part of Trump’s campaign to redraw global supply lines and boost domestic manufacturing. Predictable tech sources weighed in, including chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp. But feedback also landed from a wide spectrum of sectors, along with trading partners like Japan and Brazil..The companies, trade groups and individuals who commented on the chips investigation largely signaled support for the president’s vision of deepening the US manufacturing base and expanding the American workforce.

These are some of the world's strongest companies. The index has climbed about 17,000% since 1930..This is also why some investors like to bottom fish for undervalued stocks among the Dow Jones' worst performers each year. So far in 2025, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) are swimming at the bottom. Both stocks are down over 20% year to date..Let's see if either is worth buying right now..Apple stock has slid 21% year to date. Weak iPhone sales, especially in China, have weighed on the stock's performance. The weak growth from its largest product category raises concerns about Apple's strategy to tackle the burgeoning opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI)..Apple launched its AI platform, Apple Intelligence, last year. This brought several new AI features to its Mac and iOS operating system. But Apple Intelligence hasn't translated to the strong sales cycle investors were expecting..In the first half of fiscal 2025, total net sales were $219 billion, up just 4% year over year. This was mostly driven by double-digit growth in services (e.g. apps and subscriptions). Product sales posted just a 2% year-over-year increase in the most recent quarter..Apple has tremendous brand power, and it's loaded with cash. The company hauled in $98 billion of free cash flow over the last year. It certainly has the money to make some moves in AI. But it is concerning that Apple's former chief design officer, Jony Ive -- who was instrumental in designing the iPhone and other products until leaving Apple in 2019 -- recently merged his design company with OpenAI and will consult the AI leader on new hardware products..The fact that Ive is not coming back to Apple, but instead is joining the company that brought us ChatGPT speaks loud and clear that Apple is at risk of being disrupted in the next decade. Apple still has its ""walled garden"" advantage of hardware and services that many people attribute to a quality user experience. But it needs to make a bigger splash in AI than it has so far..Given these developments, the stock doesn't look that attractive from a valuation standpoint. Its forward P/E of 27 looks expensive against analysts' estimates for 10% annualized earnings growth over the long term. Investors looking for better return prospects might want to wait until Apple settles on a more promising AI strategy to grow sales before buying shares.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-2-worst-performing-134500368.html," The news article discusses potential risks related to individual stocks within the Dow Jones Index, specifically mentioning concerns about Apple's AI developments (Business/Financial Risk) and Nike's undervalued shares (Financial Risk).

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is using AI-powered code-completion tools to help developers write code 55% faster. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is leveraging AI to accelerate drug-discovery timelines. IBM (NYSE: IBM) reported over $1 billion in generative AI revenue in a single quarter. These efficiency gains translate directly to the bottom line, creating sustainable cost savings that can flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks..Consider what happens when a company with $100 billion in revenue uses AI to improve efficiency by just 5%.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder saw as the alchemy of collaboration..Jobs told interviewer Bob Cringely that, as a boy, a widower neighbor showed him a homemade tumbler, ""a motor and a coffee can and a little band between them,"" filled with ""regular old ugly rocks,"" water and grit.

Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share..The tumbling, he said, mirrors ""incredibly talented people bumping up against each other, having arguments, having fights sometimes, making some noise"" until both ideas and individuals are refined. Jobs, then running NeXT and poised to return to Apple, argued that the best companies court constructive friction. “...Working together, they polish each other and they polish the ideas,” he remarked..According to an NBC article from 2017, former colleagues say Jobs organized project rooms so engineers and designers could not avoid debate, a practice later echoed in Apple's iPhone and Pixar's story-brain sessions..Why It Matters: Steve Jobs routinely engineered tension to sharpen ideas, whether by ringing Pixar colleagues ""at any time, day or night, three in the morning"" and expecting instant answers, a habit Pete Docter says he now refuses to copy..His intolerance for half-measures surfaced again this month when tech watchers joked that Jobs would ""have fired everyone"" over a lackluster iOS interface, an exaggeration that nonetheless echoed stories of him dismissing teams that failed to hit the mark on the first iPhone's glass swap and other last-minute pivots..Yet the same razor-edged perfectionism often came wrapped in jolts of generosity meant to keep morale high.

Over the weekend, OpenAI pulled promotional materials related to its $6.5 billion acquisition of Jony Ive’s io startup in order to comply with a court order involved in the suit. OpenAI says it’s fighting iyO’s allegations of trademark infringement..For the last year, OpenAI executives and former Apple leaders now working at io have vigorously researched in-ear hardware devices, according to filings submitted in iyO’s lawsuit. In a June 12 filing, lawyers representing OpenAI and io said the companies purchased at least 30 headphone sets from various companies to explore what’s on the market today. In recent months, OpenAI and io executives also met with iyO’s leadership and demoed their in-ear technology, according to emails revealed in the case..That said, OpenAI’s first device in collaboration with io may not be a pair of headphones at all..Tang Tan, a longtime Apple executive who co-founded io and serves as the startup’s chief hardware officer, claims in a declaration to the court that the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io’s launch video “is not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.” Tan notes that the design of said prototype in not yet finalized and that the product is at least a year away from being advertised or offered for sale..The form factor of OpenAI and io’s first hardware device has largely remained a mystery. Altman merely stated in io’s launch video that the startup was working to create a “family” of AI devices with various capabilities, and Ive said io’s first prototype “completely captured” his imagination..Altman had previously told OpenAI’s employees at a meeting that the company’s prototype, when finished, would be able to fit in a pocket or sit on a desk, according to the Wall Street Journal. The OpenAI CEO reportedly said the device would be fully aware of a user’s surroundings and that it would be a “third device” for consumers to use alongside their smartphone and laptop..“Our intent with this collaboration was, and is, to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,” said Altman in a declaration to the court submitted on June 12..Lawyers representing OpenAI also said in a filing that the company has explored a wide range of devices, including ones that were “desktop-based and mobile, wireless and wired, wearable and portable.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/court-filings-reveal-openai-io-234438912.html, **Risk Classification:** High Risk

However, they are indications that Apple is actively listening to early user feedback and making tweaks accordingly.","With Monday’s release of iOS 26 Beta 2, Apple has fixed one of the more glaring issues with Liquid Glass, its divisive new user interface design for the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple devices, announced earlier this month at WWDC 2025..The refreshed user interface modernizes the operating system’s look and feel with a design system inspired by the optical qualities of glass, including the way it refracts light and its translucency..However, early iOS 26 testers, somewhat unfairly, were quick to point out the flaws with the updated look in the early developer beta. Though the beta build is not yet finished, users shared screenshots and criticized areas where Liquid Glass fell short in terms of readability and usability..One of the users’ larger concerns was with how Liquid Glass made the Control Center (the menu accessed by swiping down on the right side of the iPhone’s screen) nearly unreadable. Because of its semi-transparent nature, it was hard to differentiate the Control Center’s buttons and sliders from the icons and widgets on the iPhone’s Home Screen that appeared underneath..In the newly released beta, Apple has addressed the problem with the Control Center by adjusting the background blur, which better obscures the Home Screen content underneath..Notifications in the first beta were also hard to read, as many had pointed out. In the updated beta, they’re a bit sharper but still need work, especially for readability on brighter and lighter backgrounds.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-liquid-glass-interface-improves-195429256.html, No risk.

But with some of that revenue at risk, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said Monday that the government must use that money with an eye on the longer term..“One of my deep lessons from the aftermath of the global financial crisis is, when capital investment is decreased, the costs mount up in the future,” he said at Bloomberg’s Future of Finance in Ireland event in Dublin. “If our growth outlook does change, we will use our fiscal position to try to maintain and support capital investment and do all we can to avoid cutting it back again.”.The rapidly changing global backdrop is also raising concern for employment. Pharmaceutical tariffs, if imposed by President Donald Trump, are a key worry, with Donohoe warning they could cost the economy 75,000 jobs..While Donohoe said Ireland remains an attractive destination for investment, both the government and the country’s central bank have had to acknowledge the threats. Both recently cut their growth forecasts, citing Ireland’s large exposure to US President Donald Trump’s volatile trade policies..The US administration has repeatedly singled out the Irish model, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Ireland runs a surplus at America’s expense. Trump even raised the matter with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin at a St Patrick’s Day White House reception..While Trump’s policies have raised new threats for Ireland and Europe, governments are also sensing an opportunity to take advantage and boost competitiveness. Germany is increasing spending, providing a fiscal boost for the region’s largest economy, while central bankers and politicians on the continent are talking up the euro’s global profile as US policies shake dollar confidence..“Political events in the US have catalyzed something in Europe and have changed things,” said John O’Toole, global head of multi asset solutions at Amundi. “Europe is now on a path to reasserting itself and standing on its own two feet.”.Real progress is going to require Europe to do a lot more on issues like improving its capital markets and pools of liquidity.

We are watching Super Microcomputer, advanced micro devices, also known as AMD, and Apple. First up, Super Microcomputer stock sliding after announcing it plans to offer $2 billion in convertible senior notes, due in 2030. Investors can potentially buy an extra $300 million in bonds within about two weeks of the offering, and some of the funds will be used to protect shareholders from stock dilution during the bond to share conversion. One Bloomberg analyst says that the offering is necessary to support growth and should provide a cash boost to help meet AI demand. They you're taking a look at the movement of shares here. They're moving down in reaction by about 4.2%. But, but Jay, as we think about what this cash is needed for and what this essentially is trying to ensure among investors, is that you have more longer-term interest and participants who are looking to see where this cash .infusion could ultimately help them in carrying out some of the scale that's necessary to continue to compete, especially within the demand profile that we've seen for chips right now, and how generative AI has been one of the core drivers of that addressable market. .Well, that's the hope. But right now, investors have been punished owning this stock. And the ones that got in it, remember, when it was, you know, a $200 billion dollar market cap. Is it $25 billion right now? So, while this could help over the near term and hopefully set them up for the long term, uh they've kind of been left behind in the dust and there's just too much competition in the space where they've all of a sudden become the forgotten player in this space. So, to me, this this is good to strengthen the bottom line, but uh you know, technically, fundamentally, they still have a long way to go. So, uh let's hope that this is another step in the right direction to get back to where they once were. .Yeah, absolutely. And especially how the allegations certainly did put a major dent in investor sentiment around this name, still essentially trying to win back perhaps some of that support as well, to your point here. Next up, we're tracking AMD, upgraded to buy from hold at Melius. The firm also raising its price target to $65 or $65 to $175. So, they've raised that price target, so it's now $175. Melius saying that AMD's development in AI accelerators and computing make it particularly attractive in terms of future growth. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from most hyper-scale cloud computing companies who want to build out artificial intelligence interfacing here. You're taking a look at shares of AMD right now higher by about 1 and a half percent. Where does this sit within your broader evaluation of the chip landscape? .Well, this has been a laggered in the sector for a while. So, to see that upgrade and to see that we've kind of put in a tradeable bottom in the stock to me is good. So, I'm just going to look at this from a trade perspective from a technical perspective because I don't know the ins and outs and I'm not going to profess I do compared to some of the other chip makers in this space. But technically, this just broke a long-term downtrend. Risk reward setup is somewhere where you want to take a shot at this if as long as it stays above that 200 day moving average around 125. I I like it. It looks like it's going to have a little bit more room to run. Uh the target price was about 165 I think you said. 160 looks like a good risk reward setup with a 5 to 10 point downside. So to me, this is a tradeable bottom in the semi space is coming back. And uh there's one big semiconductor stock they've really take them all to another level uh in Nvidia that breaks 150. So to me, I think this is a good place from a risk reward setup to get into the name. .Yeah. One of the other notes within this note or one of the comments within this note, our hunch is that we are in the middle of another move to the upside again, as investors are about to envision even bigger GPU, graphics processing unit, figures in 2026 through 2028. They're counting on a sustainable surge here in inferencing, where investing in AMD's platform seems to be more attractive for hyperscalers and sovereigns. We will see if that comes to fruition here. We got to talk one more name for you though, and that is Apple. Apple potentially looking to make a bid to acquire Perplexity AI. This is according to a Bloomberg report. Perplexity, which was recently valued at $14 billion, would build out Apple's AI infrastructure, specifically an AI search engine. Now, these discussions are in the very early stages, we should note, and it's possible that discussions will not lead to any kind of offer here. And shares of Apple, they're moving lower by about three tenths of a percent, but around that offer too as of right now. You know, as we're seeing this interest from Apple now to make sure that they don't miss out on what the next wave of search engines could look like, powered by generative AI. What does that signal to you about Apple's interest in making its ecosystem even more sticky, and how that would read through to the investor thesis and how that could shift if this does go through? .Well, investors have been waiting for that next big thing from Apple for a long time. But they've been looking on the hardware side. .And that's it. And this this could be it. We we didn't talk about Siri at the last WWDC event which was two weeks ago. It kind of was forgotten where a year ago that's all they focused on was Siri, Siri, Siri. And now it's going to turn on as I say that. I apologize to everyone in the audience. But what is going to happen now is they need to kick the tires on this. And AI perplexity is a known. It's a big name. They have the cash on the sidelines to spend. It's time for them to step up and do something monumental. And if they're going to get into the AI space, this is a name you have to watch carefully. So it could just be talk for now, and I'm sure the price tag is going to be astronomical. But if anyone can afford to do it and anyone needs to change things up, it's Apple. So to have these discussions is a good first step. Let's see where it goes, but they need to shake things up because right now they're just surviving, when they're surviving, they're thriving on their utility metrics and not in the innovation side of things. So let's see if this is a game changer for them. It hovers around 200. It's a nice interesting level. Let's see if you can break it above. .Yeah, to your point, uh what what is, you know, $13, $14 billion in terms of an acquisition when you typically tend to see Apple holding onto hundreds of billions of dollars in cash on hand here. We're going to continue to track all of those names here, and you can too by scanning the QR code on your screen to track all of your Yahoo finances trending tickers throughout the session.

Together, they make up the “Prominent 10.""","Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S..It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy..Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%..Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI..But what about China?.Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services..Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years..The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC..E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10.

These players faced a few difficult months recently due to concerns about a potential economic slowdown. However, some of the uncertainty has passed, suggesting better days may be ahead for AI stocks..Against this backdrop, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are set to soar in the second half. Here's why..President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports weighed on technology stocks, including AI chip giant Nvidia, several weeks ago. This pushed Nvidia down nearly 30% from the start of the year through early April. Though the president initially exempted electronics products, this exemption was temporary, suggesting chips and other items would face tariffs at some point in the near future..But Nvidia has since rebounded, thanks to optimism that tariffs won't be as steep as originally expected and as the company showed the strength of its earnings through the first quarter of the year. Nvidia's revenue surged 69% to $44 billion, demand remained strong, and customer comments indicate that their spending plans for the year remain intact. This bodes well for ongoing growth for Nvidia..On top of this, the chip giant is making investments in U.S. manufacturing to limit any eventual tariff impact and sticks to its plan to update chips on an annual basis -- a move that should keep it ahead of rivals..Today, Nvidia trades for only 33 times forward earnings estimates, down from about 50 times just a few months ago, and this level offers the stock plenty of room to run in the second half..Among all the top tech stocks, Apple may be the one that has suffered the most amid the recent tariff turbulence. Trump, displeased that Apple has generally produced most iPhones abroad, even threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's imported iPhones. Meanwhile, Apple has made efforts to diversify its manufacturing, with a plan to move much of it from China to India..Uncertainty remains as the president wants Apple to bring iPhone production to the U.S., but doing this could result in a drastically higher price for the smartphone. All of this has hurt Apple stock, which is down about 20% since the start of the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stocks-set-soar-second-221000712.html," The news article reflects a risk classified as **market volatility** due to the unpredictability of stock performance based on changing market expectations and external factors such as regulations, supply chain issues, geopolitical events, economic uncertainty, and shifts in investor sentiment."

Boyle told Wired that by using a rig that could hold 20 iPhone Pro Max cameras, the filmmaking team created “basically a poor man’s bullet time,” capturing the brutal action scenes from a variety of angles..Even when he wasn’t using the rig, Boyle (who once directed a biopic of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs) said the iPhone was the movie’s “principal camera,” albeit after disabling settings like automatic focus and adding special accessories..“Filming with iPhones allowed us to move without huge amounts of equipment,” Boyle said, noting that the team shot in parts of Northumbria that look like “it would have looked 1,000 years ago,” so the iPhone allowed them “to move quickly and lightly to areas of the countryside that we wanted to retain their lack of human imprint.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-danny-boyle-shot-28-202200987.html, **Risk Classification:** Technology Risk - Film Production
2025-06-22 22:01:00,Nvidia: How the chipmaker evolved from a gaming startup to an AI giant,"Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI.","Over the past two decades, Nvidia (NVDA) has skyrocketed into global conversation..The semiconductor company is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)..Beyond its strengths in the gaming, data, and AI fields, Nvidia announced plans this March for a quantum research center in Boston, where CEO Jensen Huang said researchers could tackle problems from drug discovery to materials development..Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI..On April 5, 1993, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia with an initial focus on designing and producing 3D graphics processors for computing and video games..The company’s first product release, the multimedia processor NV1, didn’t get the reception the founders were hoping for. What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html," The article discusses Nvidia's evolution from a gaming startup to an AI giant.

The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html," The news discusses three tech giants' potential to reach a $3 trillion market cap, highlighting their growth strategies while acknowledging possible risks:  1. **Amazon**: Risks include competition from other large companies and potential regulatory challenges.  2. **Alphabet (Google)**: Potential issues might be slower-than-expected growth or increased competition in the ad market.  3. **Meta Platforms**: Concerns could involve regulatory pressures, especially regarding data privacy and AI applications.  Additionally, broader risks such as macroeconomic factors like interest rates or inflation affecting consumer spending and advertising revenue are at play. These risks encompass both company-specific challenges and broader market dynamics.

Its stock tanked after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcements, since its iPhones are predominantly made overseas, and its artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades have underwhelmed. Apple stock is trailing the market, down 21% year to date, even as the S&P 500 is starting to climb again..Is it as bad as the market thinks? Here's one metric you should see before you decide..Apple has a wide ecosystem of products and services that generates long-term loyalty and engagement. The company has always been focused on the user experience, with well-designed products that work. The iPhone is its premier product, with more than 2.3 million in circulation, and fans tend to upgrade at high rates..There's been some lumpiness with iPhone sales over the past few years, since customers bought more phones when the pandemic started, and growth has tapered off. In the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended March 29), iPhone sales inched up only 2% over last year. However, these users will be due for new phones over the next few years, steering the growth cycle back to historical norms..Apple has been able to monetize its users with higher-margin services like streaming and fitness apps, which lead to a stronger bottom line. As users engage more with Apple's platform, it reinforces the ecosystem in a positive cycle. Service revenue was up 12% year over year in the second quarter, and earnings per share increased 8%..This may be why Apple has been slower on the AI uptick than investors have been expecting. Unlike other AI companies like Nvidia and Amazon, Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, is a consumer-facing service rather than a platform or product for developers. Like the rest of its ecosystem, its interest is in producing tools that enhance the user interface and keep its customers happy. Apple is not the kind of company that's going to launch new products or features for hype. It's all about quality, which is why its products are expensive, and for most of its users, worth it..This ecosystem creates a ""stickiness"" that makes Apple a great company. Warren Buffett has described it as a ""very, very, very special product, and which has an enormously widespread ecosystem, and the product's extremely sticky.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-apple-slowing-down-1-081200529.html," **Risk Classification:** The article discusses potential risks to Apple's stock due to tariffs and AI issues, which are macroeconomic and technological factors impacting the company.  **Result:** Risk."

He expected Apple to hit the mark first, followed by Nvidia, and then Microsoft. But I think he got the order reversed: Microsoft will reach a $4 trillion valuation first..Both Nvidia and Microsoft currently have market caps around $3.5 trillion, while Apple has seen its stock fall to about $3 trillion in market cap. The leading tech giants have received a clear boost from artificial intelligence (AI) spending, but Apple has struggled to make headway in advanced AI capabilities..As a result, it looks like either Nvidia or Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion valuation threshold first. And despite strong operating results from Nvidia, Microsoft looks to have the edge..Nvidia's strong results over the last few years were driven by unprecedented growth in its data center business. For the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year..The hyperscale customers like Microsoft are buying Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can produce them. In fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year..However, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including Microsoft. If those customers pull back on AI spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth..It faces plenty of challenges from other GPU makers and custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. Several of them are working to build chips for both training and inference that offer better price performance than Nvidia's all-in-one solution..So, while the GPU maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. The stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. That's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as Nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in AI, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-vs-microsoft-stock-reach-075700927.html," The article discusses the competitive status of Nvidia and Microsoft as they approach a $4 trillion valuation milestone.

While venture capitalists funnel billions into speculative start-ups, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to dominate the infrastructure powering the entire industry. A projected 9% annual return may not sound thrilling, but it could be the smartest risk-adjusted investment in tech this decade..According to Coatue Management, an American technology-focused investment firm, Nvidia's market cap could grow from $3.5 trillion today to $5.6 trillion by 2030, implying a 9.6% compound annual growth rate from current levels. That's a far cry from its recent hypergrowth, but it reflects a business that's maturing into its role as the backbone of the AI economy..Here's why Nvidia remains a compelling buy -- even as its pace of growth slows..Think of Nvidia as the Apple of AI. Just as the iPhone represents great hardware backed by an impenetrable ecosystem, Nvidia has built something far more valuable than fast chips -- it has created the core operating system for AI..The company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform has become the default language for AI development, with over 4 million developers now embedded in the ecosystem. Switching to a competitor means rewriting years of code, creating a switching cost that grows stronger every day..But Nvidia isn't stopping at software dominance. The company has systematically expanded into every layer of the AI stack. DGX Cloud lets companies rent AI supercomputers by the hour, democratizing access to massive computing power. New enterprise platforms help businesses deploy AI without armies of data scientists..The Omniverse platform powers everything from factory simulations to digital twins of entire cities, while the majority of automakers now rely on Nvidia's DRIVE platform for autonomous vehicle development..This isn't diversification for its own sake. Each new product strengthens the core GPU business. A company using Nvidia for robotics simulations naturally gravitates toward Nvidia chips for its data centers.

The smartphone and computer giant is down around 10% in the last 12 months, while artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are soaring..Management has made some major missteps in virtual reality and false promises with its Siri and Apple Intelligence services. Revenue is growing slowly, and innovation seems to be lacking for this storied technology brand..Is Apple in trouble? Here's why investors should be concerned about owning shares of this stock..Back in early 2024, Apple released the Vision Pro, an expensive virtual reality headset that it promised was the next evolution in computing. The device sold for $3,500 and had a futuristic ski-goggle look and aimed to replace the personal computer for people working at home. Apple has been researching virtual and augmented reality technologies for years, but this was its first large foray into the cutting-edge computing space..Now in June 2025, the Apple Vision Pro looks like a total flop. The company had to scale back production because of weak demand, failed to attract developers to make applications for the device, and has sold fewer than 1 million devices (reportedly) since its launch. Even if it sold 1 million of these devices a year, that equates to $3.5 billion in annual revenue, compared to $400 billion in consolidated revenue for Apple. The device isn't going to move the needle financially..The Vision Pro can officially be called a flop. New versions may change consumer sentiment, but Apple has failed in its first foray into the virtual reality space. This company is still being driven by the iPhone and iPhone software and services..Speaking of smartphones, Apple has promised customers and investors that new AI-focused updates will be coming to Apple devices shortly. Bullish investors see this as a reason for customers to upgrade their iPhones, which has been a nagging issue for the company, as customers are sticking with older devices for longer..As with the Vision Pro, Apple talked a big game around upgrades for Siri and Apple Intelligence products. However, the actual products released have been lackluster..At its annual developer conference, the company delayed the launch of AI Siri to early next year. At the same time, AI competitors, such as Alphabet and OpenAI, are pushing forward with cutting-edge productivity tools, leaving Apple in the dust.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-trouble-083500043.html, The risk associated with the news is classified as **Operational Risk**.

The talks, reported by Bloomberg and involving senior executives including M&A chief Adrian Perica and services head Eddy Cue, are still at an early stage and may not result in a formal offer..The move underscores Apple’s struggle to keep pace with rivals amid increasing pressure to integrate artificial intelligence across its hardware and software ecosystem. In particular, Apple has faced persistent delays in its efforts to upgrade Siri, leaving the voice assistant trailing competitors such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s Grok..Perplexity, recently valued at $14 billion in a funding round, could significantly accelerate Apple’s ambitions in AI-driven search and user interaction. The acquisition would also represent the largest in Apple’s history, surpassing its previous deals in both scale and impact on the company’s long-term strategy..Apple’s interest in Perplexity also comes as it reassesses its relationship with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose search engine generates an estimated $20 billion a year for Apple as the default option on iPhones and other devices. That deal has come under regulatory scrutiny from U.S. antitrust authorities, fueling uncertainty around its future and prompting Apple to consider building its own AI-based search engine..According to Bloomberg, Apple has not yet contacted Perplexity’s leadership about a potential takeover. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reportedly attempted its own bid earlier this year but could not come to terms, instead pivoting to a $14.3 billion deal for a 49% stake in Scale AI as it builds a team focused on producing a “superintelligence.”.The AI market has become increasingly competitive as Big Tech firms vie for top talent and cutting-edge capabilities to stay ahead in the generative AI race. For Apple, generally conservative about large-scale acquisitions, a move on Perplexity would signal a strategic departure, highlighting the urgency of closing its AI gap..Related articles.Apple internally weighs bid for ChatGPT rival Perplexity, Bloomberg says.This sector is uniquely positioned to capture infrastructure spend growth: analyst.Caloric reset driven by GLP-1 drugs could cut food volumes by over 10%",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-internally-weighs-bid-chatgpt-220653076.html," The news about Apple considering an internal acquisition of Perplexity AI involves multiple potential financial risks:  1. **Market Competition**: The tech industry is highly competitive, and acquiring a startup may not provide a significant competitive edge.  2. **Regulatory Hurdles**: There could be regulatory scrutiny or legal challenges affecting the deal's feasibility.  3. **Intellectual Property Issues**: Integration without infringing on patents or causing IP conflicts is a risk.  4. **Financial Investment**: The acquisition might require substantial investment, which could affect Apple's cash reserves despite its liquidity.  5. **Strategic Fit**: Integration may face challenges due to differing strategies and cultures between Apple and Perplexity AI.  6. **Integration Risks**: Cultural clashes, communication issues, and operational inefficiencies post-merger are potential pitfalls.  These risks indicate that the acquisition poses a significant financial risk that requires careful assessment."

China’s system is improving but remains cumbersome, they said, contrary to Trump’s assurances rare earths would flow “up front” after a June 11 accord struck in London..The delays are holding an array of American industries hostage to the rocky US-China relationship, as some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China. That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing in Geneva last month, and triggering fresh rounds of retaliation..Interviews with multiple Western buyers, industry insiders and officials familiar with discussions revealed frustration over vague policies in both countries and lingering confusion about what level of magnet approvals from China would trigger Trump to abandon his tit-for-tat export curbs..“Even if export approvals accelerate, there are so many unknowns about the licensing regime that it’s impossible for companies to have a strong sense of certainty about future supply,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “At a minimum, they need to factor in a real possibility that talks could break down again, and exports will be halted.”.In response to China’s sluggishness on magnets, Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China until President Xi Jinping restores rare-earth exports. Companies subject to Washington’s curbs have halted billions of dollars in planned shipments as they wait for players in unrelated sectors to secure permits from Beijing, which could take weeks or even months to process, given the current pace..Corporate chiefs affected by the export-control spat have sought clarity from the administration on its strategy, according to people familiar with the matter.

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +5.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.67 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-trending-stock-130002356.html, No risk

But it’s getting better in ways that point to a broader future for spatial computing.","In 2023, the flagship reveal at Apple’s WWDC keynote was unquestionably the debut of the Vision Pro. The headset wasn’t just Apple’s first all-new platform since the Apple Watch. It was also the company’s opportunity to define what, exactly, a computer you strap to your head should do..Most Read from Fast Company.Kroger is closing 60 stores: See the list of locations that are reportedly shuttering in 2025 so far.Housing market map: Zillow just released its updated home price forecast for 400-plus housing markets.What’s behind the rise in interim CEOs.Being Apple, it purposefully steered clear of existing concepts such as the metaverse and virtual reality. Instead, it embraced a term it stood a shot of owning: spatial computing. Rather than aiming to nail one or two experiences—movie-watching or gaming or even industrial-strength applications such as training—the Vision Pro would aspire to deliver general-purpose utility reminiscent of the Mac. Just in a radically new, immersive form..Flash-forward to this year’s WWDC. No longer the keynote’s headliner, Vision Pro took its place among the Apple platforms getting operating system updates in the fall—in its case, VisionOS 26. That’s not a sign of diminished relevance, though. Those yearly software upgrades keep Apple gear evolving and improving; over time, they contribute more to a product’s relevance than even the biggest-bang hardware introductions. And VisionOS 26’s meatiness makes for a striking contrast with the barely evolving Apple TV box, a product that still feels like a hobby at best more than 18 years after Steve Jobs described it as one..Last week, after watching the keynote at Apple Park, I got some eyes- and hands-on experience with the Vision Pro’s new features and discussed them with Steve Sinclair, senior director of Apple Vision Pro product marketing, and Jeff Norris, senior director of apps and content for the Vision Products Group. The two executives emphasized the practical ways VisionOS 26 expands on the Vision Pro’s capabilities. The upgrade, Sinclair told me, “adds new ways to connect. It adds new ways to be more immersed. It unlocks new methods to interact with the spatial digital content that we have. And it makes Vision Pro something that users can enjoy using every single day.”.Increasing the everyday value of an existing product is always worthwhile, particularly when the product in question costs $3,500 and is still in the process of establishing itself. But VisionOS 26 is part of a longer-term bet. In April, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is working on two new headsets and that CEO Tim Cook is eager to release something in a more glasses-like form factor when the technology is ready. Nobody at Apple is going to speak publicly about such unannounced products. But just the plurality of the “Vision Products Group” in Norris’s title indicates that the company doesn’t see the Vision Pro as a one-off.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visionos-26-proves-apple-isn-113000834.html," The news pertains to Apple's continued challenges with the Vision Pro and its operating system, VisionOS 26. This relates to ** existential risk** due to potential risks such as: - **Market Penetration**: Slow adoption may reduce revenue streams. - **Competitive Risk**: Increased competition in spatial computing could affect market share. - **Investment Risk**: Subpar technology might necessitate costly investments or partnerships.  There is no mention of financial losses or direct financial impact, so while there are risks, they don't fall under a specific predefined category."

Even with the wide stock market indices approaching new all-time highs, shares of Apple are down 25%, making it one of the worst-performing large-cap technology stocks in 2025..Investors are worried about tariffs, slowing revenue growth, and antitrust lawsuits that may impact the smartphone maker's future earnings power..Is now the right time to buy the dip on Apple stock? Let's put the numbers to the test and show why Apple is a risky big tech stock to purchase today..The iPhone is still a blockbuster consumer product. Over the last six months alone, the segment has generated more than $100 billion in revenue for Apple, making it the most popular smartphone in the world by revenue..The problem for investors is the fact sales have stagnated for the last few years. Apple has been able to consistently raise the price of new iPhones, but upgrade cycles are proving longer and longer for consumers, meaning they are going more years before buying the latest device. This is a major headwind to revenue growth..In order to expand its ecosystems of devices, Apple has made inroads into wearables like the Apple Watch and AirPods. These are successful products, but will not move the needle for Apple's $400 billion in consolidated annual revenue. To do that, Apple made its largest hardware launch since the iPhone with the Vision Pro virtual reality headset. A device that costs $3,500, the headset was supposed to be Apple's next big computing paradigm, giving its users more advanced computing tools for work and pleasure..So far, it looks like the Vision Pro has been a flop. Estimates are that unit sales are cumulatively less than 1 million, with many purchasers reportedly stopping using the device after a trial period..Apple remains a hardware provider tethered to iPhone sales, a product category that has matured. Expect more struggles to grow revenue on the hardware side of things in the years ahead unless Apple can come up with a breakthrough new computing device..The golden goose of Apple's business in the last few years has been its software and services segment. Including App Store revenue, licensing deals, and revenue from its first-party apps such as Apple Music, services revenue has grown from $13 billion in 2012 to $102 billion over the last 12 months.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-dip-apple-stock-085500976.html," The article discusses factors affecting Apple's stock, such as weak product launches, declining prices in a bear market, economic issues like tariffs and slower growth, and legal risks from antitrust lawsuits.

Some platform operators had questioned whether a user’s age could be reliably established using current technology..The results of the government-backed trial clear the way for the law to come into force by the end of the year. The findings also potentially allow other jurisdictions to follow Australia’s lead as countries around the world grapple with ways to protect children from harmful content online..“Age assurance can be done in Australia and can be private, robust and effective,” the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial said in a statement Friday announcing its preliminary findings..The trial’s project director, Tony Allen, said there were “no significant technological barriers” to stopping under-16s gaining social media accounts. “These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said..Under the new law, digital platforms including Snapchat, Meta-owned Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches..The trial tested a range of methods and technologies, including facial scans, inferring a user’s age based on their behavior, age verification, as well as parental controls. The tests also took into account the ways teenagers might try to circumvent age checks..“We found a plethora of approaches that fit different use cases in different ways, but we didn’t find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,” the trial said in its statement..More than 50 companies participated in the trial, while Apple Inc. and Google, developers of the most popular mobile-phone operating systems, are also contributing, Allen said on a video conference call on Friday..The trial didn’t assess public acceptance for any particular technology or the costs involved. The accuracy of the different methods, for example the margin of error for facial analysis, wasn’t made available.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-moves-closer-011443922.html," The news pertains to Australia's progress toward implementing a social media ban for under-16s. This development carries several risks:  1. **Regulatory Impact on Tech Companies**: The potential shift towards stricter age restrictions could alter market dynamics, prompting tech companies to adapt their strategies or face reputational risks.  2. **User Experience Concerns**: Implementation challenges might affect user experience, potentially frustrising users or parents.  3. **Potential Pressure from Other Nations**: The ban may attract similar regulations elsewhere, placing pressure on global tech companies to adjust their products.  Thus, the risk classification is: **Positive Development with Regulatory and Market Impact Risks**"

2025-06-20 01:36:00,"The Week in AI: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked.""","A new civil war in AI, Andreessen's rant, and Zuck splashes the pot.","Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: ""We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.""CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system -- NVIDIA NVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find ""product-market fit"" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in ""the revolution"" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up after Apple AAPL researchers released their paper ""The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.""We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models ""give up"" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply ""token prediction"" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the ""vibe-coding"" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the ""limitations"" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled ""The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking."" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the ""top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted"" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article ""This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.""And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work ""as fast as possible""...""Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.""Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the ""Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.""I have several posts in the comments of the ""The Week in AI"" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: ""All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.""Translation: AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: ""The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle."" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled ""The Gentle Singularity.""I call it his ""love letter"" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a ""symbiosis between people and AI"" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of ""post-labor economics"" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the ""not-so-gentle"" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be ""hip.""On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing that Alphabet GOOGL is ""firing on all cylinders across AI"" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last ""search is dead"" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta Platforms META plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be ""mined and modeled"" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough, Advanced Micro Devices AMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...""The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?""It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.""I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer ""thinking."" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other ""intelligence experts"" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line: To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor can benefit from increased spending on AI computer chips.  Both semiconductor-related companies are projected to grow faster than Apple this year.","Apple is falling behind in the artificial intelligence field, and the business is growing slowly..ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor can benefit from increased spending on AI computer chips..Both semiconductor-related companies are projected to grow faster than Apple this year..10 stocks we like better than ASML ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a huge winner in the smartphone era, which it pioneered with the iPhone. Now, it looks to be at risk of falling behind in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and mixed reality. The tech giant failed with the launch of its Vision Pro product and has struggled to release any products related to consumer AI while the competition pushes ahead aggressively..It is time to forget Apple stock. Here's why you should buy two AI beneficiaries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), for your portfolio instead..Revenue growth has been stagnant at Apple for many years now. The iPhone is maturing, and while it is still a great product, there are only so many dollars floating around the world that can be dedicated to buying a smartphone. In the last decade it has released some successful ancillary products such as the Apple Watch and Air Pods, but these are not large enough to move the needle for a company with a market capitalization of $3 trillion..Management claims the company has not been resting on its laurels, but the results so far have been underwhelming. The iPhone is increasingly similar with each yearly update, minimal AI features have been added to its branded ""Apple Intelligence"" products, and the Vision Pro virtual reality headset was a flop. Other big technology companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are pushing ahead with these cutting-edge technologies, leaving Apple in the dust..Unsurprisingly, Apple's revenue growth has slowed down quite a bit as a result. This year, analysts project just 4% revenue growth for the technology giant, which will mostly come from software and services revenue. The stock trades at an expensive price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31 even though it is barely growing anymore. This leaves much to be desired with the stock's valuation. There is not much upside to owning Apple stock today versus other fast-growing technology players around the world..Speaking of fast-growing technology companies, we have ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC, for short). These are two players in the computer chip and semiconductor supply chains -- suppliers to Apple, it should be noted -- that are benefiting immensely from the rising spend on AI.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-buy-2-artificial-120000731.html, **Risk Classification:** Investment-specific

With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: What Does Mamdani’s Primary Win Mean for New York Real Estate? and Shell Dismisses BP Takeover Talks as Mere ‘Speculation’.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots). Another option might be to simply expand the Magnificent 7 to a Magnificent 8..This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

While this indicates strong financial health, potential risks include:  1. **Overvaluation**: As the stock continues to rise, there may be a risk of valuations becoming inflated relative to earnings, leading to market correction or value decline.  2. **Operational Risks**: Rapid expansion into new markets or acquisitions could introduce challenges such as integration issues or increased competition for resources.  3. **Revenue Diversification Risks**: Dependency on key clients or product lines could be vulnerable to downturns in specific sectors.  4. **Macroeconomic Sensitivity**: The tech sector's reliance on broader economic conditions, including interest rates and inflation, poses indirect risks affecting performance.  5. **Cybersecurity Risks**: As a major provider of semiconductors for critical infrastructure, potential vulnerabilities could result in significant impacts or reputational damage.  In summary, while Broadcom's growth is positive, these factors suggest that careful management is essential to mitigate associated risks."
2025-06-19 18:05:00,Why UBS Is the Only Wirehouse to Allow Podcasting,"For years, Mitch Slater urged UBS to let its advisors launch their own shows. Now, more than 50 advisors have them.","The future is here, and it’s now available wherever you get your podcasts..For the past several years, UBS has built out its podcasting program to help its advisors launch their own shows, expand their online reach and connect with younger audiences. The initiative is designed to help advisors connect with the next generation of wealth management clients and bring in new assets, according to Mitch Slater, executive director of digital communications for the wirehouse’s national sales. A recent report found that every dollar spent on podcasting may generate an additional dollar in new revenue, and that podcasts’ ability to attract clients increases over time..“The fact is, it’s $80 trillion being moved over from my generation to the generations below,” said Slater. “If you’re not skating to where the puck is, and the puck is [phones]… we just got to get there. To me, the podcast seems to be a really great way to do this.”.READ ALSO: Morningstar’s CEO Kunal Kapoor on Private Assets and ‘Extracting Gold’ and Succession Planning Vacuum Risks Alienating RIA Clients, Next-Gen Leaders.Podcasting in general is in its heyday, with the number of Americans who listened to one in the past month jumping to 158 million in 2025 from 135 million a year earlier, according to data from Backlinko. More than half of the US population are now monthly listeners, an important fact to consider amid the Great Wealth Transfer, Slater said..UBS is the only wirehouse that lets its advisors market their businesses via podcast, Slater said, adding that every episode, before it gets uploaded to Apple Podcasts or Spotify, is subject to regulatory approval based on the Series 9, 10 and 24 exams advisors take. Although only about 1% of UBS’s advisor workforce — roughly 60 out of 6,000 advisors — are podcasting, he expects the venture to expand quickly and said there are another 10 to 15 podcasts in the works. UBS now has dozens of podcasts that speak to such niches, including:.“Lightning in a Bottle,” a podcast led by the UBS advisors Josh Pottinger and Jason Chirogianis, which focuses on how advisors can monetize their ownership positions..“Huvane Wealth Management Conversations,” another show led by a New York-based UBS team, which focuses on portfolio strategies, taxes, next-gen investors and sustainable investing..But First, Lemme Take a Selfie (Video). Slater is also involved with the firm’s “selfie video program,” in which advisors learn how to film themselves vertically, primarily for LinkedIn. At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, he said, the videos helped calm nervous clients. “Everyone has to have some form of marketing,” Slater said. “Whether it’s podcasts, whether it’s videos, whether it’s a better LinkedIn engagement program — there’s something that’s right for everybody.”.This post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

These factors suggest that while Podcasting could offer value, the associated risks require careful management for UBS."

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has disappointed investors this year.,"Apple's valuation has nosedived this year as it has fallen behind its peers on next-gen technologies..The company's researchers aren't convinced that generative artificial intelligence can reason like humans..The business has struggled to generate much growth in recent quarters..10 stocks we like better than Apple ›.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has disappointed investors this year. It has delayed some artificial intelligence (AI) features for its iPhones until next year, and that has resulted in a lot of bearishness around the business as there are rival phones with advanced AI capabilities already available..Shares of Apple are down more than 21% thus far in 2025 (as of June 13), with its valuation dipping below the $3 trillion mark..AI is a hot topic these days, with consumers seeking the latest tech on their phones to help with many day-to-day tasks. However, Apple recently published a report about AI that could shed some light as to why it may not be leading the charge and investing as heavily in next-gen technologies as other tech companies..Researchers at Apple have been testing multiple AI reasoning models, and while they have seen that they can perform better than standard models, they fail as tasks become more complex..As a result, the researchers believe that there are limits to the reasoning that AI can achieve, and they don't appear to be as convinced of its abilities as the general public. They found that the models couldn't follow steps in complex tasks and appeared to rely heavily on the familiarity of data, as opposed to applying advanced reasoning skills..AI chatbots have become more sophisticated because they have been trained on existing data, but the ability for them to truly reason like humans is by no means a certainty. If Apple isn't convinced of the potential that AI possesses, that may be part of the reason it hasn't been investing as heavily in these types of technologies as its peers..Whether or not AI can reason like a human doesn't excuse the fact that Apple has fallen well behind other companies in terms of innovation. While Apple has made changes to the look and feel of its icons with its Liquid Glass design, the company's newest iPhones haven't given consumers a compelling reason to upgrade their devices. Apple's product sales over the six-month period ending March 29 have totaled $166.7 billion -- up just 2% from the same period last year. And iPhone revenue during that stretch was nearly unchanged.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/real-reason-apple-far-behind-085000525.html, The risk associated with this news falls under **Technology - AI/ML Risks**.

From 1965 through 2024, Buffett guided Berkshire Hathaway stock to an astounding 5,502,284% cumulative return, smashing the S&P 500 index's 39,054% return..Although Buffett will be retiring at the end of this year, Berkshire's stock holdings are full of competitively strong companies that can grow your savings. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are dominant tech firms with millions of loyal customers. If you have $1,000 to invest right now, these are excellent stocks to anchor a well-diversified portfolio..Berkshire has held a stake in the leading e-commerce and cloud computing provider since 2019. Amazon has multiple high-margin revenue streams that make it a solid investment for a long-term investor. The stock has returned 66% over the last five years and should continue to grow in value..Amazon's e-commerce and cloud services form a potent combination. It's important to understand that e-commerce is the largest revenue driver, totaling 38% of the company's $650 billion of trailing-12-month revenue, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) generates most of the company's $71 billion of trailing operating profit..AWS is seeing strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) services for enterprises, but Amazon is also leveraging this technology for its e-commerce business..For example, the company uses AI to forecast demand for products and allocate its inventory where it is needed most. This ultimately leads to faster delivery speeds, satisfied customers, and greater cost efficiencies that benefit profit margin..Amazon's operating income increased 20% year over year in the first quarter. The strong growth it is seeing in other profitable businesses like advertising and third-party fulfillment services is also having an impact on Amazon's bottom line and could justify a higher share price..Berkshire still held 10 million shares of Amazon in the first quarter. The stock's price-to-earnings multiple of 35 is the lowest in over 10 years, making it a compelling buy right now..Buffett originally invested in Apple stock in 2016, and it's been one of Berkshire's most successful investments in its history. Even after Berkshire reduced its stake last year, Apple remains its largest investment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-074500527.html," The news regarding Warren Buffett's recommended stocks involves several risks:  1. **Selection Bias**: The advice may focus on high-growth sectors without considering all possible investment options or strategies that cater to different risk tolerances.  2. **Time Horizon Mismatch**: Buffet's long-term focus might not align with someone seeking quicker returns or needing liquidity sooner than the recommended timeframe.  3. **Market Timing Risks**: Recommendations could be based on current market conditions, which may not hold as markets shift or face unexpected downturns.  4. **Concentration Risk**: Recommendations in tech sectors can lead to overexposure if those investments underperform unexpectedly.  These risks highlight the need for careful consideration when applying such investment advice to specific amounts and time frames."

A U.S. federal appeals court has tossed out a $300 million jury verdict that found Apple liable for infringing wireless patents held by Optis Wireless Technology. The court flagged a key flaw in how the trial judge bundled all the patents into a single infringement questionstripping Apple of its right to a unanimous jury decision on each individual claim. As a result, the case now heads back to Texas for yet another trial, covering both infringement and damages..The battle dates back to 2019, when Optis sued Apple over LTE standard-essential patents used in iPhones and other devices. The original jury handed down a $506 million verdict. That was later reduced to $300 million in a retrialonly for the latest ruling to wipe the slate clean again. Meanwhile, Optis isn't backing down. The firm insists its patents are critical for high-speed connectivity and says it remains highly confident that the court will eventually recognize their value. Apple hasn't responded publicly to this latest development..But that's not the only front where Apple is fighting. Just last month, a UK court separately ruled that Apple owes Optis $502 million for violating similar patentsa decision the company plans to appeal. While Apple's win this week could ease near-term legal pressure in the U.S., the broader IP battle is far from resolved. For investors, the key takeaway: this is a reminder that when it comes to standard-essential patents, courtroom wins can flip fastand nothing is final until it's final..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-just-erased-300-million-165333628.html, The news pertains to **Regulatory/Legal Risks** due to potential future litigation issues and ongoing legal complexities despite resolving an initial problem.

TI says it’s working with the Trump administration to help produce the critical chips that power everything from smartphones to data centers and cars domestically. It’s part of the White House’s push to keep the United States ahead of China in the technology industry while promoting American manufacturing..TI, which partners with tech and auto giants like Apple, Nvidia and Ford, claims this is the “largest investment in foundational semiconductor manufacturing in US history.”.“President Trump has made it a priority to increase semiconductor manufacturing in America – including these foundational semiconductors that go into the electronics that people use every day,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a press release. “Our partnership with TI will support US chip manufacturing for decades to come.”.The announcement marks the latest major planned investment in the United States by an American company as Trump pushes industries like tech to onshore more production. Earlier this month, General Motors said it would invest $4 billion to increase US production. Apple said in February that it would invest $500 billion to expand its US facilities. Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank announced in January that they would team up to create a new company called Stargate to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in America..However, some of these tech giants – including Apple and TSMC – were expanding in the United States long before Trump’s second administration..Reviving US manufacturing has been a tentpole goal of Trump’s presidency. For the first three months of his second term, he went on a tariff blitz, promising to impose levies on nearly every product made abroad. He claimed these efforts would boost jobs in the US and rebalance what he saw as unfair practices by America’s trading partners..Trump Mobile, a new venture from the Trump Organization, plans to launch a new smartphone in September that it claims will be “proudly designed and built” in the United States. But experts have said manufacturing products like iPhones domestically would be a daunting challenge even if the United States had the necessary fabrication plants.

One of the biggest selling points of the device, which will be priced at $499, is that it will be made in America..But the announcement, made by Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. on Monday, leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Chief among them: How the company plans to manufacture a smartphone in America in the first place..According to Trump Mobile, the T1 Phone will be available in September. But experts are throwing cold water on the idea that the device can be built in the US by that time, or even within the coming years..IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said the T1 will likely be based on an existing phone manufactured overseas..“Smartphones are not like you decide to print a few more T-shirts or a few [types of] other merchandise,” Jeronimo told Yahoo Finance. “They are complex products. So first, I doubt they are manufacturing or building phones themselves.”.“This looks like a typical white label product that you go to change and buy it from someone, put the logo on top, but that's it,” he said..Counterpoint Research analyst Blake Przesmicki offered a similar assessment of the T1 phone, saying in an email that it “is likely that this device will be initially produced by a Chinese [original device manufacturer].”.Todd Weaver is the developer of Purism’s Liberty Phone, a privacy-centric smartphone that uses US-built electronics. Weaver it took his company years to set up the facilities and source the necessary components to ensure the phone’s processing and communications features all come from America..“There’s a lot of challenges, many years, to even get to the scale that we’re at, which is only thousands of phones and not hundreds of thousands of phones,” he told Yahoo Finance..In an interview with conservative YouTube personality Benny Johnson, Eric Trump held up what he claimed was a golden Trump phone, though it struck more than a passing resemblance to an iPhone..Trump later added that “eventually all the phones can be built in the United States of America.”.Yahoo Finance reached out to Trump Mobile for clarification on the phone’s origins but didn’t receive a response by deadline..The Trump Mobile site lists the T1 Phone as sporting a 6.8-inch AMOLED display and 256GB of storage. The company also oddly lists its RAM as 12GB of storage. RAM and storage are different forms of memory..The phone will also come with a triple lens, set up with a 50MP main camera, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro lens.

The probes are widely expected to result in levies on a range of foreign-made products in those industries..President Donald Trump is already using that authority, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, to impose import taxes on steel and aluminum he launched in 2018. Recently, he’s widened the scope by targeting consumer goods that contain the metals..By one estimate from Michigan State University, Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, currently set at 50%, are hitting almost $200 billion worth of steel, aluminum and household items such as fishing reels and brooms — nearly quadruple the amount during his first term..The effort comes as Trump’s April tariffs on major trading partners stand on shakier legal ground, with the Supreme Court asked on Tuesday to consider striking them down. Some administration officials believe the 232 levies could effectively supplant the country-by-country duties that have drawn legal scrutiny and bogged down negotiations with US allies and adversaries alike trying to strike deals..Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner at Wiley Rein and former senior Commerce official during Trump’s first term, said the 232 measures are shaping up to amount to “something close to global tariffs.”.“These 232 actions are very likely going to result in import restrictions on almost every good entering the US, and the size and scale of these restrictions will be so massive because China’s distortion has been so massive,” she added..Speaking to reporters this week while returning from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said pharmaceutical tariffs will be coming “very soon” and they will encourage companies to reshore production. “It’s going to bring most of them back into, at least partially back in,” he said..The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment..The latest example of Trump’s wider targeting under his 232 powers came last week when the Commerce Department announced that 50% duties on steel and aluminum products would be expanded to cover home appliances including dishwashers, dryers and washing machines.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed more than 220,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997.","Amazon's recent stock performance and growth are much better than Apple's..Apple seems to be stronger financially and has a more attractive valuation than Amazon..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Two of the largest companies on the planet have also been among the biggest winners for investors over the years. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed more than 220,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) share price has soared more than 59,000% since its IPO in 1980..However, accolades achieved in previous decades don't necessarily translate to future success. Just ask Blockbuster Video or Blackberry..Which is the best stock to buy right now -- Amazon or Apple? Here's how the two stocks stack up against each other..If you're a fan of momentum trading, Amazon will probably be more to your liking than Apple. Sure, shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant tumbled earlier in the year over concerns about President Trump's tariffs. However, Amazon has been on a roll since late April, jumping nearly 30%..What about Apple? The story isn't as positive. Apple stock also fell sharply over tariff worries. Although shares of the iPhone maker have rebounded somewhat, they remain down around 20% year to date..Unsurprisingly, both Amazon and Apple are strong financially. Deciding which company is stronger, though, might depend on the financial metric you prioritize the most..For example, Amazon has a larger cash position. Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as of March 31, 2025, totaled over $94.5 billion. By comparison, Apple reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $48.5 billion, as of March 29, 2025..However, Amazon also has a larger debt load of $157.9 billion, compared to $98.2 billion for Apple. If you focus more on net cash position adjusted for debt, Apple comes out on top..One of the best measures of financial strength, in my opinion, is how much free cash flow a company generates. Apple's free cash flow over the last 12 months totaled $98.5 billion, much higher than Amazon's free cash flow of $25.9 billion..Amazon is the clear leader when it comes to recent growth. In its most recent quarter, the company's revenue increased by 9% year over year and earnings soared 64% year over year. Apple's growth pales in comparison. The consumer-tech giant's revenue and earnings increased by around 5% year over year in its latest quarter..Both Amazon and Apple could have solid growth prospects in the future. Amazon's cloud unit should remain a key growth driver for the company as organizations build and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models in the cloud. The company also continues to expand into new areas, such as healthcare and satellite internet services.

The same investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period.

As a result, he doesn't invest in technology stocks very often, and he certainly doesn't chase hot trends like artificial intelligence (AI)..However, there is one AI stock that could be a great fit in Berkshire's portfolio because it meets most of Buffett's investment criteria, and he has even expressed regret for not investing in it during its early years..Buffett is a value investor who likes to buy good companies when they are trading cheap, but he doesn't shy away from picking up shares of spectacular companies at a fair price..When considering a potential investment, Buffett looks for companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams. He also likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback programs. But time is Buffett's most important weapon because compound growth amplifies his results over the long term -- he has often been quoted as saying his preferred holding period is forever..Buffett oversees numerous wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, including Duracell, Dairy Queen, and GEICO Insurance. But he also helps manage its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, which currently includes holdings in 38 companies and is worth around $278 billion today. As I mentioned earlier, he generally avoids technology stocks like those in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but he has made exceptions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-isnt-081600959.html," The article discusses an AI stock that aligns with many of Warren Buffett's investment criteria but isn't part of his portfolio. The potential risks associated with this news include:  1. **Competition**: The presence of established tech giants like Apple and Amazon may pose competition for the new AI company, potentially affecting its market position.  2. **Lack of Competitive Edge**: If the new AI company doesn't offer a significant competitive advantage over these established companies, it could face challenges in sustaining growth.  3. **Market Volatility**: The high-growth sector of AI technology is subject to market volatility, which can impact investor sentiment and stock performance.  4. **Regulatory Risks**: Unforeseen regulatory changes or hurdles could affect the company's operations and profitability.  5. **Economic Sensitivity**: As a new entrant in the AI market, it might not have as much institutional support or brand recognition compared to established companies.  These risks highlight the need for careful consideration before investing in such a technology stock that follows Buffett's criteria but isn't included in his portfolio."

However, its revenue growth over the past few years has been modest, while much of its stock gains have come from multiple expansions, as its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been increasing..The company also appears to have fallen behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, with Apple Intelligence features reportedly consistently running into delays. In addition, some high-gross-margin revenue from a revenue-sharing agreement that allows Google to be the exclusive search engine for Safari on Apple devices is at risk after Alphabet lost an antitrust trial where the agreement was at the center of the case. While the company likely wouldn't lose all of this revenue, there is a risk that some of it would go away if it gave users the option to choose their default search engine..Against this background, the upside for Apple may be limited over the next several years, opening the door for other companies to become larger than Apple. Let's look at two companies that could exceed Apple's market cap in the next five years..With a market cap of roughly $2.3 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is well-positioned to overtake Apple in size over the next few years. The company is the market-share leader in two important segments: e-commerce and cloud computing. And while Apple has lagged on the AI front, Amazon has gone all in, incorporating AI throughout its businesses to help make them more efficient and drive growth..Its e-commerce business has settled into being a high single-digit, low double-digit percentage revenue grower. The segment is seeing strong margin expansion and operating leverage, which are powering profitability growth. Its high-gross margin, sponsored-ad business is playing a big part, with revenue climbing 19% year over year last quarter to $13.9 billion..Amazon is also seeing a lot of operational efficiencies. The company now incorporates AI throughout its warehouse and logistics operations to improve efficiencies and lower costs. It is developing AI-powered robots that can perform multiple tasks and even detect damaged items, helping the company save money on labor and costly returns. Meanwhile, it's using AI in its logistics business to help drivers save time and fuel by planning better routes and helping them more easily locate hard-to-find addresses in places like large apartment complexes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-thatll-worth-074500784.html, No risk.
2025-06-18 15:15:00,Apple WWDC25 – Enhancing ecosystem value over single AI agent,Apple’s WWDC25 was about enhancing its user interface with AI capabilities instead of a singular agentic experience. It steered clear of Siri and seems to have learned from its marketing snafus of 2024.,"Apple maintained a subdued tone during its WWDC 2025 announcements, focusing on what it excels at: simplifying user interfaces (UI) for everyday interactions and enhancing the seamless integration and consistent appearance of its devices across various platforms..Key highlights from the event included the adoption of a streamlined operating system (OS) naming convention that aligns with the current year (iOS 26, iPadOS 26, etc.), enhancements to continuity features throughout its ecosystem, the unveiling of a new design aesthetic termed Liquid Glass across products (a Vision Pro feature), and incremental advancements in Apple Intelligence..Apple Intelligence was peppered throughout the announcements. The company acknowledged the need for additional time to meet its quality standards – the nonchalant manner of the announcement reflected Apple's confidence in its ongoing development, despite recent discussions around AI advancements in the industry. This approach may also serve as a strategy to deflect unwelcome inquiries following the critical scrutiny Apple Intelligence has faced from the tech media. Among the notable AI features showcased were the new Live Translate function, which leverages on-device intelligence, Visual Intelligence capabilities, and a contextual search feature called Spotlight, exclusive to MacBook users..The most significant updates were for iPadOS 26, which now offers improved multitasking capabilities, including the ability to resize windows, and AI-driven features such as Live Translation in iPhone, FaceTime, and Messages. Apple appears to be diminishing the distinction between iPads and MacBooks with its new windowing system, Mac-like controls, and a menu bar. This enhancement renders the iPad experience more potent and versatile, potentially obscuring the traditional demarcation between the two devices, especially the iPad Pro and the MacBook Air. This convergence may lead to a degree of cannibalization between the two product lines, however..Apple has changed its UI for the first time since iOS 7 launched 12 years ago. Liquid Glass, a Vision Pro UI aesthetic, stands out for its unique design, which leverages the optical properties of glass to create a visually striking, slightly raised UI icons. The update to Liquid Glass is not merely a cosmetic change but a move to modernise Apple's OS..This modernisation seems to be laying the groundwork for compatibility with future devices, such as AR glasses. These glasses overlay an enhanced, or ‘elevated’ UI onto the real-world environment, suggesting Apple's potential foray into this sector.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-wwdc25-enhancing-ecosystem-value-071546946.html, No risk

When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L). ""As a result, we’re seeing many of the biggest and best AIM companies moving to a main market listing.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-uk-aim-struggling-alternative-investment-050024609.html, The risk classification for the UK's AIM market includes:  1.

It was the first time Taiwanese officials have used that blacklist to sanction major Chinese firms, taking a cue from a longstanding US approach of blocking access to advanced technologies..The move also marks Taipei’s first public action on semiconductor restrictions since President Lai Ching-te pledged in April to address unspecified concerns from Washington about export controls. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, people familiar with the matter said, with a particular focus on enforcement of existing curbs. They requested anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly..A congressional committee focused on China, meanwhile, said after Taipei’s move that the US “must continue working with our partners to ensure the CCP’s attempts to illegally transfer tech are stopped cold.”.Taipei’s decision may be the first of a series of measures tightening the flow of technology to China, marking a departure from a policy of nurturing cross-Strait business ties. The longer-term goal may be to throttle supply of the vital components, silicon materials and plant construction expertise that helped transform Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. into the world’s most advanced chip operation..“This recent shift marks a substantive move toward strategic technological competition with China,” said Chiang Min-yen, an analyst at Taiwan’s government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology. “Compared to other tech democracies with similar industrial structures — such as Japan and South Korea — Taiwan is now taking a more decisive stance.”.Lai didn’t specify in his April comments what steps Taiwan would take in response to US concerns, but instead described a broader strategy to boost trade relations with the US. It’s unclear whether the Huawei and SMIC sanctions are related to ongoing tariff negotiations with Washington, or whether the US requested that specific step.

Is the Trump family’s entrance into the mobile phone market a cause for concern for AAPL investors?.Make no mistake, Apple has problems, and some of them are Trump-centric. The president made his displeasure particularly clear with Apple’s plans to move production of most of the iPhones used in the United States to India, remarking about CEO Tim Cook, “I said to him, ‘my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India.’ I don’t want you building in India.”.Apple has pledged to invest $500 billion across the United States over the coming four years, including through building an advanced server manufacturing hub in Texas. These initiatives are expected to help mitigate Apple’s exposure to tariffs while simultaneously generating political goodwill through localized production..At the same time, Apple has stepped up its efforts to diversify its manufacturing footprint. As of the second quarter of its fiscal 2025, around half of the iPhones intended for U.S. consumers are now assembled in India, which is an outcome of a notable strategic shift. In addition, a substantial share of iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods for the American market are now manufactured in Vietnam..As for the potential challenge posed by Trump Mobile, Apple appears well-insulated. With a global installed base of more than 2 billion active devices, a brand identity that is unrivaled in the tech world, and a deeply integrated ecosystem that creates substantial user lock-in, it is hard to envision a scenario where a nascent competitor like T1 Mobile poses any meaningful disruption.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-family-betting-big-mobile-202734808.html," The news about the Trump family's investment in T1 Mobile presents several risks that could impact Apple Inc.'s position in the competitive mobile phone market.   **Risk Classification: Direct Competition with Major Players**  This news primarily falls under the category of **competition risk**, specifically involving direct competition with established firms like Apple Inc. T1 Mobile's entry into the mobile phone market, which already features a strong presence from companies like Apple, can lead to increased market saturation and potentially affect consumer choice and preferences. This could result in reduced market share for Apple if T1 Mobile succeeds or underperforms.  Additionally, while other factors such as regulatory risks, financial commitment, and competitive strategy are also relevant, the primary concern from an investment perspective is the direct threat posed by competition within the mobile phone industry."

Shares have declined 22% against the industry’s 4.3% growth..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Considering the current weakness of ARM shares, investors may wonder if now is the right time to invest in the stock. Let’s delve deeper..ARM’s core strength in power-efficient chip architecture remains central to its leadership in mobile computing. Its designs power sleek, energy-saving devices from Apple AAPL, Qualcomm QCOM, and Samsung, making ARM the foundation of today’s mobile innovation. As demand for performance on minimal power rises, Arm Holdings’ chips continue to dominate smartphones and tablets..Apple leverages ARM’s architecture for its M-series chips, while Qualcomm depends on it to power its Snapdragon lineup. Samsung integrates ARM designs across mobile and consumer electronics, further affirming its critical role. ARM’s proven ability to balance high efficiency and low power draw has solidified its status in the mobile era..ARM is rapidly emerging as a foundational player in the age of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). As Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung pursue AI-driven innovation, they increasingly rely on ARM’s flexible, energy-efficient architecture. AI models are being embedded into everything from wearables to cloud data centers, and ARM’s chips are built to meet these growing demands..Apple continues to scale its AI integration on ARM-based silicon, Qualcomm expands its AI capabilities in mobile and automotive, and Samsung explores next-gen IoT through Exynos chips powered by ARM. With machine learning and edge computing at the forefront, ARM is becoming an indispensable infrastructure for the next wave of tech advancement..ARM faces notable risks due to its significant exposure to China, its second-largest market. Growth in the region has been sluggish, and one potential reason is the rising adoption of RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture increasingly favored by Chinese firms. This trend may soon accelerate, as the Chinese government is preparing to issue formal guidelines aimed at promoting the development and widespread use of RISC-V technology. Such state-backed support could further weaken ARM’s position in the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem over the coming years..Given China's strategic focus on reducing dependence on foreign chip architectures, Arm’s reliance on this market presents a long-term concern. If RISC-V adoption continues to gain traction, Arm Holdings’ growth prospects in China could remain muted, affecting its broader global momentum.

This development represents a significant step toward bringing Apple Intelligence features to the Chinese market, though regulatory headwinds continue to cloud the partnership's future..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The technical integration of Alibaba's AI models with Apple devices marks meaningful progress in their collaboration to deliver AI-powered features to Chinese consumers. Apple Intelligence encompasses various AI tools, including Genmoji and Writing Tools, which require local partnership to comply with Chinese regulations. The partnership has gained strategic importance as Apple's iPhone sales captured the top position in China during May, with global sales rising 15% year over year in April and May according to Counterpoint Research data.However, the collaboration faces mounting pressure from U.S. officials who have been scrutinizing the arrangement. Reports indicate that White House and congressional officials are examining Apple's plans to integrate Alibaba's AI technology into iPhones sold in China, reflecting broader tensions in U.S.-China technology relations. This scrutiny introduces uncertainty about the partnership's timeline and ultimate implementation, potentially affecting both companies' strategic plans in the crucial Chinese market..Alibaba's fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results presented a mixed picture that disappointed investors. Total revenues reached RMB 236.5 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth, though this figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.49%. The company's adjusted EBITA showed stronger performance with 36% year-over-year growth to RMB 32.6 billion, indicating operational efficiency improvements.The Taobao and Tmall Group demonstrated resilience with customer management revenues growing 12% year over year, primarily driven by improved take rates. Meanwhile, the Cloud Intelligence Group accelerated growth to 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This cloud performance underscores the potential value of the Apple partnership, though regulatory uncertainties may limit near-term benefits.However, various business segments showed mixed results, with some areas like Cainiao Smart Logistics experiencing revenue declines due to operational restructuring.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicates a downward revision of 1.5% over the past 60 days to $10.62 per share, the market appears to be pessimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baba-down-8-month-partnership-155900688.html," The news about Alibaba's stock performance and potential partnership challenges can be classified into several financial risks:  1. **Regulatory Headwinds**: The ongoing regulatory issues may persist, affecting not just Alibaba but potentially other companies in the industry.  2. **Operational Challenges with Partnerships**: The partnership with Apple might not deliver as expected, posing an operational risk to Alibaba's growth and revenue streams.  3. **Mixed Quarterly Results**: Inconsistent performance could lead to investor sentiment swings and affect future stock movements.  4. **Uncertainty on Future Growth**: The cautious approach in waiting for better entry points introduces uncertainty about future profitability and market positioning.

The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint earlier this year, and the judge found the new arguments sufficient to deny Apple’s request to dismiss the case..The plaintiffs claim that Apple holds a monopoly in the cloud-based storage market for iPhones, both in terms of revenue and user numbers..For context, Apple lets users of its devices back up data like photos, videos, and other documents from their devices to any cloud storage service of their choice, but users can’t backup devices’ core data to these services, nor restore them..In its motion to dismiss, Apple defended its decision to limit third-party cloud apps from accessing core data, including app data and device settings, citing security reasons..“That design decision was and always has been a feature grounded in security and privacy considerations, given the sensitivity of the data required to restore one’s Apple device,” the company wrote..Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-court-denies-apple-request-121820223.html," The risk category is ""Antitrust and Competition Law."""

Berkshire Hathway has delivered a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over 59 years, while the benchmark has registered a 10% gain over that time period.","Buffett hasn’t been known to invest in the latest hot technologies, but you still can apply his techniques to tech investing..The investing giant has delivered market-beating gains for nearly 60 years..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Warren Buffett, as chairman, has helped Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio grow to more than $258 billion -- and it's even beaten the S&P 500 index along the way. Berkshire Hathway has delivered a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over 59 years, while the benchmark has registered a 10% gain over that time period. This isn't thanks to investing in the latest technologies or hot trends but rather to choosing a variety of quality companies in often slower-moving industries, such as consumer goods or financial services..But this doesn't mean you can't apply Buffett's techniques and investing principles to an area he wouldn't necessarily dive into today, such as artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, it's a fantastic idea to consider AI stocks that fit Buffett's playbook, as we know that elements this top investor looks for often lead to investing success..Now the ironic thing about the following two stocks is they actually are ones Buffett owns. But it's key to point out he didn't buy them as AI investments -- he picked up shares of each well before the AI boom -- and I wouldn't expect Buffett to scoop up any stock as an AI bet just yet. But if the billionaire were to change his mind and start shopping for AI players, he probably would add to his holdings of the following two companies..Several years ago, before Buffett picked up Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares, the investing giant said he regretted passing on the stock earlier on. He said he hadn't imagined it was possible to build such an e-commerce empire. Shortly after making those comments, in 2019, one of Buffett's managers added Amazon shares to the portfolio, and the rest is history..Buffett may have bought Amazon for its leading e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses, and today these strong businesses continue to make Amazon a great buy. But on top of this, Amazon is also winning in AI: The company has applied AI tools to its operations to gain in efficiency, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells AI products and services to AI customers..Why is Amazon a Buffett-style buy? This is thanks to the company's solid moat, or competitive advantage, and it takes the form of AWS' leadership. It's easy and logical for current customers to turn to AWS for their AI needs. Considering that AWS is the world's No. 1 cloud-services provider, this means many potential AI customers are ready and waiting. Amazon's e-commerce business also has a strong moat.

Designed for DIY installation, the U200 Lite features a retrofit design compatible with most Euro mortise locks. It also supports Matter over Thread to ensure compatibility with a wide range of connected devices and seamless integration into users’ existing smart home setup..Built upon the Thread protocol, which is purposely developed for IoT devices, the Smart Lock U200 Lite is Matter-certified and integrates with major platforms – including Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, Home Assistant, and SmartThings – without the need for a proprietary hub1. As an integral part of a connected home, the U200 Lite can be integrated with a variety of smart devices, from video doorbells, surveillance cameras to smart sensors, enabling users to create a customized and enhanced smart security system..The U200 Lite is compatible with Euro mortise locks with the Emergency Function2, and supports EU profile and select Scandi profile cylinders. Its hassle-free retrofit design offers homeowners and renters an instant update to their existing locks, without the need for complex installations, key changes, or door modification..Multiple secure door entry options are offered by the U200 Lite. Family members can conveniently unlock it using mobile apps (Aqara Home and other Matter-enabled apps) or voice commands via Siri and Alexa. More intuitively, they can also unlock by simply tapping their iOS and Android phones on the provided NFC Sticker Card, which can be placed on the outside of the front door. Even when away, homeowners can remotely open the door for visitors using the mobile app. All remote functionalities, such as real-time alerts, device logs, and remote unlocking, are provided subscription-free..With its built-in gyroscope, the U200 Lite provides acoustic reminders if the door is not properly closed, ensuring it is never left unsecured. Once closed, it automatically locks, and there is no need for an external door sensor —offering a more aesthetically pleasing and cost-effective solution3.
