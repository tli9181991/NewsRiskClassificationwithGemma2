2025-06-17 12:03:00,Stock-Split Watch: Is This AI Stock That's Soared 300% Next on the List?,"Only one ""Magnificent Seven"" company hasn’t yet split its stock.  Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares.  Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such as Nvidia and Amazon -- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed.","Only one ""Magnificent Seven"" company hasn’t yet split its stock..Stock splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy the shares..10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›.Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such as Nvidia and Amazon -- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed. But one AI stock, in particular, hasn't ever launched a split, and that's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Here's why this company, which has soared more than 300% over the past three years, could be next on the list..Before diving in, though, let's take a closer look at how and why companies split their stocks. These operations are used to lower the price of each individual share -- so companies generally do this after their stock prices have made significant gains and have arrived at a price that may discourage some investors from buying..For example, as stocks approach the $1,000 mark, even if valuation looks fine, they still may be viewed as expensive by certain investors. And investors who don't have access to fractional shares might find it difficult to buy a stock at these levels. These two elements could weigh on demand for the company's stock, limiting its potential for further gains..Companies split their stock by simply offering more shares to current holders -- the number of shares depends on the ratio of the split. So, for example, in a 10-for-1 split, if you originally held one share, you would hold 10 post-split. The value of each share would be worth less than it was prior to the operation, but the total value of your holding would remain the same..All of this means a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about the company or the stock, but it does make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy..As mentioned, Nvidia and Amazon completed splits, along with other technology giants such as Broadcom and Alphabet. And, over time, almost every member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- a group of tech stocks that led the stock market higher last year -- has completed a stock split. The exception is social media and AI powerhouse Meta..Like its fellow Magnificent Seven players, Meta has delivered impressive stock performance -- and actually is the second-best performer over the past three years, after AI chip giant Nvidia..Today, Meta shares trade for more than $600, outpacing the rest of these star tech stocks -- Microsoft is the closest, with shares trading for about $470.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-watch-ai-stock-081000729.html

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday. He raised his price target to $215, well short of its close at $322.16 last week..Explainer: Why Tesla’s Valuation Rests on Musk More Than Reality.Videos of the robotaxi launch posted Sunday were mostly mundane, showing Model Y SUVs driving short distances, navigating intersections, avoiding pedestrians and parking — all with no one sitting in the driver’s seat. The debut was “largely uneventful” and free of major missteps, with the start of revenue service marking a “critical milestone” for bulls in the stock, Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a note.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-starts-long-awaited-robotaxi-003252048.html

The company’s top line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. A strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon’s expanding global presence, growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are key positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus. The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to increase 8.5% from 2024. However, Amazon announced mixed guidance for the second quarter. High tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods imported from China have cast uncertainty on retailers such as Amazon. AMZN's free cash flow has decreased significantly.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Home Depot’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (+2.2% vs. -2.5%). The company’s performance is supported by strong execution across key growth initiatives. Home Depot continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings. These factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects. However, HD faces softer demand in big-ticket discretionary categories, reflecting consumer caution amid high interest rates. Margin pressure, currency headwinds, and macroeconomic uncertainty also remain key risks. HD is also navigating a complex global trade environment, with rising tariffs.(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)Shares of Cisco Systems have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+44.7% vs. +43.5%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in recurring revenue bases bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances the recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio. However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.(You can read the full research report on Cisco Systems here >>>)United Homes’ shares have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (-37.4% vs. -5.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $193.97 million is facing challenges which include persistent margin pressure, declining orders and execution risk tied to unproven strategies. Despite this, shares trade at deep discounts, suggesting an upside if execution improves.Nevertheless, United Homes is executing a strategic transformation focused on margin expansion and operational efficiency. A shift toward refreshed home designs, now yielding 24% gross margins, supports profitability and reduces reliance on discounting. UHG’s pre-sale strategy improves margin visibility and working capital efficiency while rebidding efforts and faster build cycles enhances cost control. Though volume and margin remain under pressure amid soft demand, UHG is expanding into high-growth Southeastern markets, with a land-light model supporting disciplined capital returns. The recent debt refinancing improves liquidity and reduces dilution risk.(You can read the full research report on United Homes here >>>)Shares of Eastern have underperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the past year (-1.3% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $142.05 million has risks like elevated SG&A amid restructuring, cyclical reliance on Class 8 OEMs, weak R&D investment, and recent negative cash flow due to working capital drag. Valuation remains attractive at 0.62X EV/S and 6.88X EV/EBITDA versus peers. Nevertheless, Eastern Company’s performance is driven by Velvac’s market share gains and operational enhancements in the Class 8 truck segment, including vertical integration and aftermarket expansion. Despite industry softness, Eastern sustains profitability, posting Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and net income of $2 million, with a gross margin of 22.4%. A leaner balance sheet and improved working capital reinforce financial flexibility. Strategic manufacturing footprints across the United States, Mexico, and China support tariff agility and local sourcing trends.

2025-06-17 12:03:00,Jeff Bezos famously neglected to sign a prenup in his first marriage. He’s not making the same mistake twice,"The Amazon founder, who is worth nearly $224 billion, is set to wed fiancée Lauren Sanchez this week.","Jeff Bezos’ upcoming marriage to Lauren Sanchez has been complicated by his immense wealth. After losing billions in his split from his first wife, the Amazon mogul’s second chance at love comes with new layers of legal protections..When Jeff Bezos says “I do” for the second time, the real vows may be in his prenuptial agreement. With billions on the line and a famously public divorce behind him, the Amazon founder’s pending nuptials with former news anchor Lauren Sanchez are raising speculation about the legal fine print behind the mogul’s highly anticipated wedding. Bezos, who is the fourth richest person in the world and currently worth $223.7 billion, stands to lose a significant amount of his fortune without the proper legal protections should his second marriage fail..Bezos and Sanchez’s three-day Venetian wedding celebration kicks off on June 24 and is said to be costing the couple upwards of $10 million. The couple announced their engagement in 2023, but ultimately delayed tying the knot due to delays with the prenup. According to The Hollywood Reporter, an insider said that the Bezos-Sanchez marriage was originally planned for the winter of 2024 in Aspen, but adjustments to the legal agreement pushed the date back, with Bezos’ lawyers allegedly forbidding the billionaire from moving forward until the prenup was settled..Bezos’ and Sanchez’ prenup comes after the Amazon founder’s divorce in 2019 from MacKenzie Scott in which no such agreement existed. Scott walked away with more than $38 billion in Amazon shares, making the split one of the costliest separations in history. The divorce included explosive cheating allegations that accused Bezos of having an affair with now-fiancée Sanchez. The pair’s 25-year marriage long predated Bezos’ financial success; indeed, Scott worked as the first Amazon employee and witnessed Bezos usher Amazon into its iconic position. She also has four children with Bezos..Bezos’ decision to protect his assets the second time around isn’t shocking to high-profile divorce attorney Robert Cohen, of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer & Simpson, who has handled the divorces of Melinda French Gates and Michael Bloomberg. “They’ve likely been through a nightmare before, which is litigation over their prior divorce and how much you’re giving the other side, or getting, and they don’t want to do that,” he tells Fortune..Sanchez, who was married to her first husband Patrick Whitesell until 2019, allegedly signed a prenup with her former spouse with whom she shares two children. When the couple split, their assets and properties were divided per the agreement.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-famously-neglected-sign-184734141.html

Non-Prime users will be able to use the service for $19.99 per month after it publicly launches..Amazon earlier this year noted that invites to try out the new system would roll out in waves in the months ahead. As of May 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that Alexa+ had so far reached over 100,000 users, representing only a tiny fraction of the 600 million Alexa devices that had been sold. That number has grown significantly in the weeks since..Alexa+ represents a serious attempt by Amazon to create a generative AI experience for consumers that it can eventually monetize..Though Amazon created a market for smart home-connected, voice-based assistants through its Alexa-powered Echo devices, it wasn’t able to turn that traction into a revenue-generating business. Meanwhile, Alexa lost its shine in more recent years as generative AI services, like ChatGPT, took off. Compared with modern-day AI, Alexa began to feel clunky, constrained, and underpowered..Alexa+ aims to bring the digital assistant new capabilities. The service allows users to chat with the digital assistant using more natural language, where you can phrase requests your own way. For instance, you could tell Alexa, “It’s too cold in here,” to have Alexa adjust your smart thermostat. You’ll also more easily be able to create routines, search across your Ring camera footage, interrupt or pivot the conversation with the assistant, and more..The experience is more personalized, too, as it saves your preferences and remembers what you like, from favorite songs to recipes and beyond..With its generative AI component, Alexa can do things like summarize long emails you share with the service, create unique bedtime stories, generate quizzes from study guides, make travel itineraries, provide summaries of your smart home activity, and answer other questions, similar to how an AI chatbot might respond.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-million-people-now-access-173840255.html

CEO Elon Musk confirmed the robotaxi launch, while social media influencers shared videos of their inaugural rides. The pilot is considered a key step toward Musk's broader vision of autonomous mobility as a major revenue driver for the company.A small fleet of around 10 Tesla vehicles was seen operating in the South Congress area without a driver, but a passenger in the front seat acting as a safety monitor. However, the extent of their control over the vehicles remains unclear. Tesla had invited a select group of influencers to participate in the trial, which was tightly controlled and restricted to a specific area. Per Musk’s post on X, rides were priced at a flat rate of $4.20.As the launch approached, Texas lawmakers passed new legislation regulating autonomous vehicles. Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring companies to obtain state permits to operate driverless cars. The law, set to take effect on Sept. 1, 2025, indicates that state leaders from both political parties are urging the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed with caution.Tesla’s high-profile launch comes as other players in the space are also racing to expand robotaxi services.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Facilities Dive newsletter. .The rapid data center buildout is an opportunity for nearby facilities managers to make their own operations more efficient using the computing hubs’ waste heat, according to data center and district energy experts..The practice is already common in Europe, where urban district energy systems plug into data centers to pull heat off servers and provide efficient climate control for homes, businesses and campuses, Rob Thornton, president and CEO of the International District Energy Association, said in an interview..Data center heat recovery is less common in the U.S., but a nearly 10-year-old system that supplies heat to Amazon’s downtown Seattle campus highlights the potential in campus or dense urban environments, Thornton said..The Seattle system pulls waste heat from a 34-story “carrier hotel” that serves hundreds of telecom and internet companies. The system then runs the waste heat through five heat-reclaiming chillers that heat water to about 130 degrees, according to Amazon. .The resulting hot water is potent enough that the 5 million square-foot campus rarely needs to use its backup boilers, Amazon said in 2017. The tech giant estimated the project will save 80 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and avoid 65 million pounds of carbon emissions over its 25-year service life..A district energy system serving a suburban commercial district near Toronto also tapped an Equinix data center to provide space heat to “multiple residential buildings and a nearby hotel, hospital and local shopping center” and year-round hot water to “multiple buildings” in the area, Equinix Senior Manager of SustainabilityNoah Nkonge wrote in a blog post last year..Equinix also supplies heat to a swimming pool built for the 2024 Paris Olympics and surrounding nearby buildings, according to Nkonge, who serves as heat export lead at Equinix..“District energy systems have scale to assimilate and utilize large volumes of heat that would otherwise simply be rejected into the local environment as waste, sometimes exacerbating the heat island effect in cities,” Thornton said..The heat expelled by data center cooling systems is much lower-grade than the heat coming off gas-fired boilers, so it generally needs to be concentrated in chiller systems like Amazon’s and may not be useful for industrial processes that require higher temperatures. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-center-heat-could-us-105059799.html

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks skyrocketed in 2024 amid excitement about this technology that could revolutionize businesses, saving time and money and leading to important discoveries.  Against this backdrop, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are set to soar in the second half.","Artificial intelligence is an area of enormous potential for companies and investors..After a few difficult months, AI stocks could resume their 2024 momentum and soar in the second half..Three in particular could lead the way..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks skyrocketed in 2024 amid excitement about this technology that could revolutionize businesses, saving time and money and leading to important discoveries. These players faced a few difficult months recently due to concerns about a potential economic slowdown. However, some of the uncertainty has passed, suggesting better days may be ahead for AI stocks..Against this backdrop, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are set to soar in the second half. Here's why..President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports weighed on technology stocks, including AI chip giant Nvidia, several weeks ago. This pushed Nvidia down nearly 30% from the start of the year through early April. Though the president initially exempted electronics products, this exemption was temporary, suggesting chips and other items would face tariffs at some point in the near future..But Nvidia has since rebounded, thanks to optimism that tariffs won't be as steep as originally expected and as the company showed the strength of its earnings through the first quarter of the year. Nvidia's revenue surged 69% to $44 billion, demand remained strong, and customer comments indicate that their spending plans for the year remain intact. This bodes well for ongoing growth for Nvidia..On top of this, the chip giant is making investments in U.S. manufacturing to limit any eventual tariff impact and sticks to its plan to update chips on an annual basis -- a move that should keep it ahead of rivals..Today, Nvidia trades for only 33 times forward earnings estimates, down from about 50 times just a few months ago, and this level offers the stock plenty of room to run in the second half..Among all the top tech stocks, Apple may be the one that has suffered the most amid the recent tariff turbulence. Trump, displeased that Apple has generally produced most iPhones abroad, even threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's imported iPhones. Meanwhile, Apple has made efforts to diversify its manufacturing, with a plan to move much of it from China to India..Uncertainty remains as the president wants Apple to bring iPhone production to the U.S., but doing this could result in a drastically higher price for the smartphone. All of this has hurt Apple stock, which is down about 20% since the start of the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stocks-set-soar-second-221000712.html

It exceeds the number of homes in Burnley, which stood at 41,955 after the most recent Census in 2021..Planning documents show the two data centres in the development will include 42 back-up diesel generators, each around 25 metres tall, that need to be fired up fortnightly to check they are working..It is estimated this will produce the same emissions as 1,079 homes heated by gas..The plans were lodged with Central Bedfordshire Council by Colliers Properties, a known partner of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the retail giant’s cloud computing division. The documents name Amazon Data Services UK as the site’s eventual operator..Known as Linmere Island, the project would sit on an empty 22-acre greenfield site. While the plans also include 140 solar panels, it is not clear how much power they will supply to the data centres..It comes amid growing pushback against a slew of “hyperscale” data centre projects being lined up across Britain – a central part of the Prime Minister’s strategy to boost economic growth – with campaigners raising concerns over their environmental impact..One complex near Blyth, Northumberland, is forecast to produce more greenhouse gas emissions than Birmingham Airport, which carries 12m passengers per year. Another in Elsham, Lincolnshire, is predicted to generate five times the carbon dioxide of the same airport..It underscores the challenge faced by Sir Keir Starmer as he battles to restore economic growth while hitting net zero targets. Data centres are vital to artificial intelligence, and were classed as critical national infrastructure last September, with Sir Keir establishing “AI growth zones” to speed up such building projects..AWS set out plans last September to invest £8bn in the UK to build data centres. At the time, Tanuja Randery of AWS, said its strategy would help meet the “growing needs” of its customers and “support the transformation of the UK’s digital economy”..The investment was hailed by Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, as “the start of the economic revival”, and that it showed “Britain is a place to do business”.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-data-centres-consume-much-170923631.html

But Amazon isn't just playing host; it's also developing its quantum hardware, creating two distinct paths to profit from what could become a trillion-dollar market. This dual approach makes Amazon the most overlooked opportunity in the market for quantum computing..Conventional wisdom says practical quantum computing remains decades away. Most experts point to persistent challenges with error rates, qubit stability, and the need for near-absolute-zero operating temperatures. They're probably wrong..What skeptics often overlook is the recursive learning potential of artificial intelligence (AI). When AI systems can design better AI systems, progress compounds exponentially. DeepMind's AlphaFold solved protein folding -- a 50-year challenge -- in months. The same recursive improvement cycle is about to hit quantum computing..IBM plans to deliver its fault-tolerant quantum computer, Starling, by 2029 -- years ahead of previous predictions. The company says its breakthrough error-correction techniques will enable a system 20,000 times more powerful than today's quantum computers. This accelerated timeline reflects how AI is helping solve quantum's biggest challenges faster than expected..While pure-play quantum companies race to build better hardware, Amazon has taken a different approach. AWS Braket, launched in 2019, enables developers to access quantum computers from D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and others through the cloud. Think of it as the App Store for quantum computing -- Amazon profits regardless of which hardware ultimately wins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartest-way-play-quantum-computing-143000201.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,Nvidia: How the chipmaker evolved from a gaming startup to an AI giant,"Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI.","Over the past two decades, Nvidia (NVDA) has skyrocketed into global conversation..The semiconductor company is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)..Beyond its strengths in the gaming, data, and AI fields, Nvidia announced plans this March for a quantum research center in Boston, where CEO Jensen Huang said researchers could tackle problems from drug discovery to materials development..Here’s a look at Nvidia’s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI..On April 5, 1993, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia with an initial focus on designing and producing 3D graphics processors for computing and video games..The company’s first product release, the multimedia processor NV1, didn’t get the reception the founders were hoping for. What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to its unofficial motto: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”.In addition to the NV1’s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Sega invested $5 million in Nvidia — funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business..Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and over a million units were sold in its first four months of sales..With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, on Jan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000th graphics processor..Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world’s first “Graphics Processing Unit.” By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, the company popularized the term “GPU.”.With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-how-the-chipmaker-evolved-from-a-gaming-startup-to-an-ai-giant-140140110.html

Meanwhile, a $1,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago would now be worth more than $265,000..While investing in stocks typically comes with a much higher level of risk compared to bonds and other fixed-income investments, the potential for explosive returns is also much higher. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors identified these two companies as top investment candidates to put $1,000 into right now..Keith Noonan (Micron Technology): Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking the world by storm, and it seems virtually certain that its transformative impacts are still in the very stages of unfolding. Along with software advances from a wide variety of players, it's likely that high-powered hardware from a smaller group of providers will continue to play a central role in pushing the technology forward..Nvidia will likely continue to lead the high end of the graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies that help power advanced training and inference applications for AI, but it also looks like Advanced Micro Devices could be making some significant inroads in the space. While both of these processing specialists could be worth betting on, I think that investors should also take a close look at one of the key components providers for their most advanced hardware -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)..Micron is a designer and manufacturer of memory chips and storage solutions that's playing an important role in the AI revolution. While the company's business has historically revolved mostly around the consumer market, that's changed rapidly -- and memory chips used in GPUs, accelerators, and other hardware for data centers are now central to its growth story. The company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions are used by both Nvidia and AMD for advanced AI processors, and the demand outlook for these technologies is very promising..In addition to being a pick-and-shovel play that should allow investors to benefit from rising demand for GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, and other players in the AI processors space, Micron could be poised to benefit from geopolitical trends. Due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, leading domestic tech companies will likely be less inclined to rely on memory chips and storage solutions from Chinese providers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-invest-1-000-124500590.html

As I'm writing this on June 20, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index is up only 1.5% year to date. But this mellow return included a deep dip in April, so the index has gained 24% from the bottom of its 52-week low..So, things are extra volatile this year, and I understand if you'd rather keep some cash on hand right now. But even now, a few stocks can inspire me to put my extra cash to work. Read on to see why my hand hovers over the ""buy"" button for Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Costco (NASDAQ: COST), and Target (NYSE: TGT) in June 2025..Media-streaming technology veteran Roku has had quite a ride lately. Its stock price shot up by 50% over the past year but has taken a slight detour more recently, dropping 3% in the last six months..The growth story is still alive and well, with excitement over new deals, such as the recent Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ad partnership, keeping optimism afloat. However, the company still isn't showing a profit, so valuation ratios based on profitability don't make any sense. Instead, you can look at Roku's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which sits at a reasonable 2.8. That metric floated in double-digit territory four years ago..For now, Roku is acting a bit like the kid in class who has tons of potential but hasn't quite turned in the homework -- yet. The platform is growing, and recent partnerships could be a game changer, but the market wants to see proof that all these moves will translate to real, scalable profits. That's why Roku's stock looks cheap in this period of growth-focused operations and limited profits..If you're in it for the long haul and don't mind a few twists and turns, Roku still looks like a compelling candidate for a growth-focused portfolio. It's one of the few stocks I don't mind buying right now since its short-term price moves tend to be unpredictable anyway. This is a long-term growth idea..Wholesale warehouse retailer Costco is a different story. The stock has been soaring for years, lifting the P/S ratio to a lofty 1.6. That would be low in the high-growth media-streaming market, but Costco's valuation looks luxurious next to other large-scale retailers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-favorite-stocks-buy-now-115300904.html

The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)..Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there..With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising..The company is the market leader in two important fields: cloud computing and e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter..AWS is benefiting from the trend in artificial intelligence (AI) in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage..Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment..With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-giants-could-cross-105500246.html

However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting..While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia..Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom..While the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-083000803.html

The development raises serious questions about the future of traditional payment networks, especially as retailers become increasingly frustrated with the fees associated with them..Let's examine Visa's stance on stablecoins, its recent earnings, and valuation to determine whether its stock is a buy, sell, or hold..Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a steady value by being pegged to traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Backed by reserves of cash or cash-equivalent assets such as Treasury securities, they are primarily used to hold value or facilitate transactions within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem..For retailers like Amazon and Walmart, the idea is that stablecoins could reduce settlement delays, eliminate interchange fees, and ultimately become less dependent on payment processors such as Visa and its closest competitor, Mastercard..Visa's management isn't blind to the shifting landscape. The company offers a seven-day-a-week stablecoin settlement, having recently surpassed $200 million in cumulative stablecoin volume. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney described the nascent, but fast-growing opportunity:.It's still early, but we do see real potential, which is why we've been investing in the crypto space broadly in the stablecoin space specifically for many years now. We've built up a team of real experts that I think are very well respected among the ecosystem, but it's early. On the one hand, $200 million is a great kind of milestone. On the other hand, it's still a relatively, a very small portion of our overall settlement volume..Additionally, Visa is actively exploring programmable finance through initiatives like its Tokenized Asset Platform, which aims to help banks securely issue and manage stablecoins. One of its early partners, BBVA Argentina, plans to roll out the pilot stablecoin project with Visa sometime in 2025..While it remains unclear whether stablecoins will achieve widespread adoption, Visa is taking steps to ensure it maintains a central role if they do.

Anyone who regularly saves and invests their money in the stock market can build wealth.,"Amazon is the leader in two huge growth industries..MercadoLibre still has a lot of room for growth in both e-commerce and fintech..Axon is improving public safety and delivering monster returns to investors in the process..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Anyone who regularly saves and invests their money in the stock market can build wealth. Time in the market is more important than how much money you have to start. But dollar-cost averaging into a well-chosen portfolio of growth stocks can increase in value significantly over a few decades..To give you some ideas to get started, three Motley Fool contributors recently selected three competitively positioned companies to invest in today. Here's why they like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON)..Jennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon has changed many lives in many ways, from providing essential e-commerce services that have reimagined shopping habits to creating incredible shareholder wealth for early investors. That kind of growth isn't likely to happen again, but there's so much more opportunity for Amazon, and smart investors can still buy shares today to see their investments thrive..Amazon is the top name in two different industries, an incredible feat for a company that started out as an online bookseller. It has the lead in U.S. e-commerce by a wide margin, with no chance of any competitor taking over in the foreseeable future. Plus, it's continually upgrading its platform to keep it that way. Deliveries are getting faster; it's adding new products and brands to the marketplace, including luxury brands Michael Kors and Laura Mercier in the first quarter, and it's using technology like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its systems..Speaking of AI, Amazon is pioneering many of the most potent generative AI programs, primarily through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment. The second growth business where it has a lead is cloud computing, and this segment continues to grow at robust rates. AWS sales increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, and this high-margin business is also padding the bottom line, accounting for 63% of the total company operating income..CEO Andy Jassy is always talking about how massive the AI opportunity is, and it's already generating billions of dollars in sales for Amazon. He says that 85% of information technology spending is still on the premises, but he sees it as a given that it will flip in the next decade or two. ""Before this generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi-hundred-billion-dollar revenue run rate business,"" Jassy said on the first-quarter earnings call. ""We now think it could be even larger.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-life-changing-stocks-buy-120000693.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,"If I Could Buy Only 1 ""Magnificent 7"" Stock Over the Next Year, Alphabet Would Be It, but Here's the Key Reason","Alphabet stock is lagging behind other Magnificent 7 stocks, but is that a buying opportunity?","Alphabet shares have dipped 2% over the past year, while most ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks posted double-digit percentage gains..Market leaders like Nvidia and Microsoft may look flashier, but Alphabet could offer better value..A tasty combination of affordable shares and artificial intelligence (AI) expertise sets this stock apart from the rest..10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›.The ""Magnificent Seven"" moniker was originally intended as a warning to long-term investors. Remember, the movie by the same name doesn't have the happiest of endings, and the tragedy made sense as a metaphor for potential market bubbles. Still, the Magnificent Seven group keeps setting the tone for the overall stock market, and most of these stocks are market darlings in 2025, with double-digit price gains over the last 52 weeks..But Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is lagging behind with a 2% price dip over the last year, and the stock looks downright undervalued in many ways. It's the only Magnificent Seven stock I have bought this year, for one simple reason: It's the best combination of affordable shares and unbeatable artificial intelligence (AI) expertise in this elite group..The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running circles around Google Cloud..But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices. Nvidia stock trades at 47 times earnings and 49 times free cash flows today. Microsoft and Amazon have P/E ratios in the mid-30s and cash flow multiples well above Nvidia's. At the same time, Alphabet stock looks affordable at 19 times earnings and 28 times free cash flows..The numbers never tell the whole story, and there's more to say about Alphabet's long-term growth opportunities. From AI services to quantum computing systems, the company was built to thrive amid ever-changing markets and unexpected economy jolts. But the modest stock valuation is a great starting point for further research..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2025-06-17 12:03:00,"Nvidia Stock Prediction, From Someone Who Has Invested for Decades","The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia.  As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit.  In the span of only a few years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the largest stocks in the world.","The big winner of the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has clearly been Nvidia..As competition heats up in the AI chips market, cloud services providers could benefit..10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›.In the span of only a few years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the largest stocks in the world. Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailing Microsoft as the world's largest company by market cap..The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are favored by artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. .However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia. Aside from the inevitable battle for GPU market share, other companies may be better positioned to benefit from the next phases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch..There are two things that stand out about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth..First, the company's revenue has simply gone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight. In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion in revenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue. That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reason most often cited for why Nvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%..However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened. In 2022, the company's gross margin stood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors like Advance Micro Devices and Intel..However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance will to come to an end at some point, as competition heats up. Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple are all at work on their own AI chip designs that might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins..So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips..Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chips fall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-prediction-someone-invested-110000215.html

That should continue as its CUDA software program has created a wide moat, helping it attain a 92% market share in the GPU space in the first quarter. With AI infrastructure demand continuing to rise, Nvidia is well-positioned for years of continued growth..Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending..While Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips. It projects that its three furthest along customers in this area will be a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity in fiscal 2027 alone. Meanwhile, it has added other big customers since then, including Apple. Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending..Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, producing chips for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. Its technological expertise and scale have made it an invaluable part of the semiconductor value chain, allowing it to increase prices and expand margins. As AI infrastructure spending and other chip consumption grows, TSMC is set to be one of the biggest winners in the years ahead..Biggest risks: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending and/or Intel being a more viable competitor..Originally a data-gathering and analytics company serving the U.S government, Palantir Technologies' (NASDAQ: PLTR) AI platform (AIP) has been gaining strong momentum in the U.S. commercial sector. The platform helps organizations gather data from a variety of sources and organize it into an ""ontology"" that connects the data to real-world assets and processes.

Investors have their choice of growth stocks these days, especially with a surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI).","Amazon holds 30% of the cloud computing market and 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market..The company's expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) cloud services and advertising is already paying off..Amazon's stock isn't cheap, but it looks well-priced, given the company's long-term opportunities..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Investors have their choice of growth stocks these days, especially with a surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI). But not all growth stocks are young tech start-ups. Some are established players that have dug wide moats around their businesses. And one of the best long-term growth stocks is a household name: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)..The company continues to expand its revenue and earnings, maintains its enviable lead in e-commerce, and is even benefiting from the rise of AI. Here's why it's worth spending $1,000 to buy Amazon stock right now..Amazon has been such a dominant leader in the e-commerce market for so many years that it can be easy to forget just how far ahead of the competition it really is. Amazon currently holds 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, while its next-closest competitor, Walmart, has just over 6%. Amazon's ability to attract online customers, give them good customer service, and make their shopping experience relatively seamless is why the company has an estimated 180 million Prime members in the U.S. (and 220 million globally)..That huge pool of customers has led to continued e-commerce sales growth for Amazon, with North American revenue rising 8% in the most recent quarter to nearly $93 billion. And there's likely more growth coming. The company's management is guiding for sales to rise nearly 9% year over year in the second quarter to $161.5 billion, at the midpoint of guidance..Most people probably don't think of Amazon as an AI company, but it's certainly benefiting from the surging need for artificial intelligence services. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud computing provider with 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft with 21%..This means that companies of all shapes and sizes use AWS for its data center services, including AI-focused capabilities that help companies use and develop their own AI services. Amazon's lead in cloud computing is helping it tap into the AI cloud services market that Goldman Sachs estimates will be worth $2 trillion by 2030..To put Amazon's potential for AI into perspective, consider that in the first quarter of this year, Amazon's AWS operating income was $11.5 billion -- double the amount it earned from its North American e-commerce segment. To stay ahead of the competition, Amazon said it will increase its capital expenditures (capex) spending to $100 billion this year, with much of it going to AI infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ultimate-growth-stock-buy-1-093500343.html

The competitive advantage and growth strategy of a company can be misunderstood, leading to depressed valuations and underperforming share prices..Investors who can see through the stock volatility and focus on the key signals that set a company up for long-term success can be rewarded with outsize gains over time..Here are two stocks of market-leading brands that are trading well off their previous highs and could be significantly undervalued..RH (NYSE: RH), the company formerly known as Restoration Hardware, emerged as a prominent luxury furniture brand over the past decade. In the past year, however, the business struggled with several macroeconomic headwinds, such as a weak housing market and uncertainties over tariffs..Questions about near-term demand have sent the stock down 52% this year, but this is a great buying opportunity for a long-term investor..RH's trailing-12-month revenue of $3.3 billion is below its previous peak of $3.9 billion a few years ago, but it just reported a strong first quarter. Revenue grew 12% year over year in the quarter, outperforming the rest of the industry..RH is expanding its addressable market to hospitality offerings in its design galleries, such as restaurants and wine bars, which has elevated the shopping experience to something that cannot be replicated by e-commerce competitors..Moreover, the company entered the $200 billion North American hotel industry with RH Guesthouses, and it offers much more, including private jets and luxury yachts for charter in the Caribbean and Mediterranean. All this creates an ecosystem of services meant to showcase the RH lifestyle and raise the brand to something more than just furniture products..It's for these reasons that RH has a history of reporting much higher margins than the average furniture store. Its adjusted operating margin was 7% in the first quarter, below its previous 10-year average of 12%. It should return to those higher margins in a strong housing market, and this is not reflected in the stock's valuation..Over the last 10 years, the stock traded at a price-to-sales multiple ranging from 0.48 to 6.59. The average was just over 2 times sales, with the stock currently trading at a multiple of 1.16. Investors who buy shares at these lower discounted prices and hold until the housing market is fully recovered should be well rewarded.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-stocks-buy-now-081000878.html

The goal? Resilience, security, and control—values often missing from the current data ecosystem..When most investors hear the word “crypto,” they think price charts, digital assets, and decentralized finance. But according to Marta Belcher, President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation, that’s only scratching the surface..“Crypto isn’t just about finance,” Belcher said. “The real innovation is in programmable money.”.Filecoin is showing what that means—starting with decentralized file storage. At first glance, the network looks like a Web3 challenger to Amazon Web Services, allowing anyone in the world to rent out unused storage space and get paid in FIL tokens. But it’s the how that’s revolutionary: payments on Filecoin are automated, granular, and permissionless..“You can write a smart contract to pay a storage provider in real time, based on their uptime and performance,” said Belcher. “Or pay a songwriter a fraction of a cent for every second a song is streamed. These kinds of micro-transactions were never possible before crypto.”.It’s a bold reframe of what blockchain technology can do. Instead of speculative hype or abstract decentralization, Filecoin is highlighting a tangible use case: letting people earn, store, and interact with data and payments in programmable ways—no middlemen required..“Web3 lets us build systems where rules are baked into code,” Belcher added. “That opens up entirely new business models—ones where creators, consumers, and infrastructure providers are all directly connected.”.As regulators and investors continue to debate the future of digital assets, Filecoin is already shipping it. For Belcher and her team, the message is simple: crypto isn’t a bet on finance. It’s a bet on the programmable economy..Filecoin is building the 'Airbnb for file storage', says exec first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 20, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 20, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/filecoin-building-airbnb-file-storage-215818126.html

Disney owns vastly popular intellectual property such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Mickey Mouse, and Star Wars, among others..Commanding a market cap of $211.9 billion, DIS stock is up about 5.6% on a YTD basis and 15.5% over the past year. While the stock currently offers a dividend yield of 0.85%, Disney's payout ratio of just 15.8% leaves enough room for growth..Disney continues to demonstrate meaningful operational momentum under CEO Bob Iger, with recent results pointing to a sustained recovery. Since Iger resumed his role, the entertainment giant has posted compound annual growth rates of 7.07% in revenue and 43.76% in earnings, an indication that the restructuring efforts are beginning to deliver..Notably, in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025, Disney reported a top-line beat with revenue reaching $23.6 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago period. The company also returned to profitability, swinging from a loss of $0.01 per share last year to earnings of $1.81 per share this quarter, comfortably surpassing analyst expectations..Cash flow metrics came in strong. Operating cash flow surged to $6.8 billion, up from $3.7 billion in the same quarter last year, while free cash flow rose to $4.9 billion from $2.4 billion. Overall, Disney’s liquidity position remained solid as the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $5.95 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-just-struck-deal-amazon-193518990.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,"The Smartest Growth Stock to Buy With $5,000 Right Now",It's been a good week for Roku shareholders. The next few quarters could be even better.,"An exclusive TV advertising partnership between Roku and Amazon is a big win for everyone..At least three analysts pushed their price targets on Roku higher following the news, including one outright upgrade..Roku stock is rolling over the past year, but it should turn even more heads as it returns to profitability later this year..10 stocks we like better than Roku ›.It's been quite the week for Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and its shareholders. The country's leader in getting folks streaming from their TVs kicked off the fireworks by announcing a transformative deal with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) on Monday. An analyst upgrade and a pair of other firms jacking up their price targets followed..The stock is up nearly 10% heading into the final trading day of the week. Roku is a name that has fallen off of many growth investing radars, but the shares are now up 55% over the past year. With its solid growth, continuing niche dominance, and projected return to profitability for the second half of this year, it's a name you should probably start paying attention to again..At its frenzied peak in 2021, a $5,000 investment could barely be exchanged for 10 shares. That same $5,000 today could have you walking away with 60 shares. This is the kind of math that can burn investors if they're buying a falling stock with dim prospects, but today's Roku is in much better shape than it was four years ago..Roku's revenue and time spent on its platform have both nearly doubled since the shares peaked six times higher four summers ago. However, just saying that Roku is a larger company than it was back in 2021 isn't enough to convince you that this is the smartest growth stock for your next investment. Roku's success in continuing to gain market share as North America's leading streaming operating system for TVs will continue to open doors; doors like the one that was slammed off its hinges on Monday with its new partnership with Amazon..The leading online retailer runs a popular programmatic demand-side ad buying platform, and this week it turned heads by striking an integration deal with Roku. The two companies are typically competitors in the streaming space; Roku's platform competes with Amazon's Fire TV. But despite the wide gap in market cap -- Roku at $12 million and Amazon at $2.3 billion -- the online retailer doesn't attract the same captive U.S. audience as the pioneer..In the spirit of the ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" adage, Amazon advertisers will now have access to Roku's massive reach of roughly 80 million U.S. households spending an average of more than four hours a day cradling the Roku remote. The early tests were fruitful. Amazon found that teaming up with Roku would deliver its connected TV clients 40% more unique viewers with the same budget. With better ad targeting and the ability to lower the instances of viewers seeing the same ads repeatedly, Amazon points out that its advertisers can generate a lot more value on Roku through this partnership.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartest-growth-stock-buy-5-185037246.html

Perplexity recently closed a new round of funding at a $14 billion valuation..Meta also attempted to hire Perplexity Chief Executive Officer Aravind Srinivas to join the social media company’s new “superintelligence” team, which is focused on building more powerful AI systems, the people said..The talks with Meta, which have not previously been reported, highlight Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s willingness to use deals and big hires to catch up in the AI race. The talks took place before Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that gives it a 49% stake in the data-labeling startup..Meta and Perplexity didn’t respond to requests for comment..Founded in 2022, Perplexity has emerged as one of the most prominent startups using generative AI to rethink core internet services.

It accessed the platform since July of 2022 after Anthropic allegedly said it had blocked its bots from doing so. We sat down with the COO of Reddit to discuss the suit. .What's important to us is that um that we are able to protect our users privacy, their deletion rights, like we have policies um that ensure that, you know, when users take down a post, like the post is taken down. And so it's really important and as we said in our terms of service that, you know, we have a conversation with folks who have access to our data because that's a commitment that we have in terms of our policies. .Our next guest has crunched the numbers on the size and scope of AI scraping by bots and helps publishers profit from this scraping. Joining us now, we've got Toit Fenagrahi, who is the Tolbit CEO and co-founder. Tolbit is a New York based startup that helps news publishers monitor and make money when AI companies scrape their content, uh by acting almost like a toll booth of the internet. Did we get that right, Toit? .Yes, that's correct. Thanks for having me. .Absolutely. So take us into your business and and what you're seeing more broadly here, especially as we're knowing and knowledge of knowledgeable of how much scraping these AI engines need to do in order to get either knowledge sets that can then be used for generative AI efforts and they reach to basically every source part of the web that they can essentially get their hands on for free. .Absolutely. So Tolbit is a platform that helps uh websites of all sizes monitor, manage, and monetize their AI bot traffic, which essentially means we give them tools to to get an idea of how uh rampant the scraping might be on their site. We give them tools to block it and enforce content access rights. And then we give them uh a real innovation is our bot paywall, a tool that allows these AI bots to come in and actually pay for sanctioned access to that content um and and data, right? And I think one of the things that we're seeing, right, especially in the last quarter, is the demand for not for uh uh content for training, content for retrieval at inference time. When people ask a question, the bots have to go out and read and answer your question. .Is AI training as it stands right now ethical from the standard practices that users expect when they're on the internet? .I think this is a question that's bigger than all of us. I think we're uh uh definitely looking to some of the courts to set to decide and set some precedents as to whether or not training is fair use. But I think uh us as a business, right, and I think where some of the conversation should be going should be around, you know, these bots who are who have to go out when you and I ask a question on any of these platforms to go read that content, right? They don't know what happened today. They don't know what the price of a ticket was if you wanted to go to France, right? They actually have to go out and access those sites to get that information. That will be a far bigger use case than than uh just training as these tools continue to evolve. .And so what what is the revenue model like? How how does the business make money? .So essentially what with the technology that we built, we have built a gateway that any AI application, agent, bot can come in through and actually pay uh through the form of micro payments for access to content and data, right? So it could be anything from what happened today, right? You want to you want to read um what happened on the news today to I want to know, you know, what the price of a hotel is today in New York and I want you to go uh book it for me, right? And so we are able to uh let the websites set those rules, set the the access protocols for what that content data should cost. And then we take a transaction fee on top of that for enabling this faster, cleaner, licensed access to that content data. .To a really fascinating business and I'm sure there's a very large total addressable market that just continues to grow at this juncture. Thanks so much for breaking this down. We appreciate it. .Thank you. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/startup-helping-publishers-profit-ai-170000967.html

Should You Buy AMZN Stock Here?,"With Amazon reportedly exploring the launch of its own stablecoin, should you buy AMZN stock here?","The cryptocurrency landscape is heating up in 2025, driven in large part by President Donald Trump’s public embrace of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and crypto-friendly policies, as well as the recent blockbuster IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL). Amid this shifting backdrop, stablecoins — cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to stable assets, typically the U.S. dollar — have caught the attention of global giants seeking to streamline their payment processes and significantly reduce transaction fees..Amazon (AMZN), one of the world’s largest e-commerce and cloud computing companies, is reportedly exploring its own entry into this space by launching a stablecoin for online transactions.

In this article, we’ll examine the potential impact of Amazon issuing its own stablecoin, evaluate the risks and opportunities involved, and determine whether now is the right time for investors to buy AMZN stock. Let’s dive in!.Amazon (AMZN) is a global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company operates a diverse business model, encompassing retail sales of consumer products through its online and physical stores, cloud services through AWS, and advertising and subscription offerings. AMZN currently has a market cap of $2.26 trillion..Shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant are down just 4.2% on a year-to-date basis. AMZN stock has had a turbulent ride this year. After climbing above $240 in February, the stock dropped more than 30% to just under $170 by early April, largely due to Trump’s aggressive tariff agenda. However, as Trump paused or lowered the majority of his levies, the stock began trending upward, forming higher highs and higher lows, and most recently holding near the $210 support level. AMZN stock remains highly sensitive to tariff headlines, which is unsurprising given its massive e-commerce business, where tariffs can squeeze both revenue and profit margins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-wants-launch-own-stablecoin-160902302.html

(AMZN) is ending an experiment that saw drivers in Kia (000270.KS) Souls make same-day deliveries and will rely on its network of gig-economy workers instead..In the test, Amazon contract delivery firms in several US states deployed drivers for four- or five-hours shifts in the boxy little Kia Corp. hatchbacks. The trial, which began to roll out in 2023, gave the world’s largest online retailer more control over deliveries. If widely deployed, it also could have reduced the company’s reliance on Amazon Flex drivers, who use their own cars to ferry orders to customers’ homes. Those gig workers will now pick up the affected routes..Owners of the participating Delivery Service Partners, as Amazon calls its contract delivery firms, were recently notified that the quick-delivery program will be winding down over the next few months, the company confirmed..“After more than a year of gathering feedback from customers, DSPs, and teams at Same-Day Delivery facilities, we’ve determined that the DSP model isn’t currently the right fit for Same-Day Delivery and we’ll be moving away from it,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate the contributions from participating DSPs and their teams, and we’ll provide support throughout this transition.”.Amazon tested the concept in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas and Washington. Kelly said the affected DSPs can operate other Amazon routes and that the company will help drivers get jobs with other firms, if necessary. The program’s vehicles were rentals and will be returned to the vendor, he said..Amazon, which started out relying exclusively on the US Postal Service and other carriers to get goods to customers, in the last decade built a sprawling logistics operation centered around small businesses. These DSPs lease blue Amazon Prime-branded vans and employ the drivers, who might deliver 200 or more packages a day..Flex drivers opt in via a smartphone app and typically deliver packages from Amazon’s same-day delivery depots..Both programs have been criticized by workers’ advocates who contend that the drivers, operating at Amazon’s direction, should be classified as company employees..©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ends-speedy-delivery-kia-154028075.html

While Realty Income isn't pioneering new technologies, its business model is stable and recession-proof.  Let's explore why a $1,000 bet on shares in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Realty Income (NYSE: O) could help investors preserve and grow their portfolios in this rapidly evolving economic landscape.","Amazon's workforce reduction could be going into hyperdrive. Equity ownership will be key in an AI-driven world..While Realty Income isn't pioneering new technologies, its business model is stable and recession-proof..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.We are in a pivotal moment where new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics could dramatically change the job market and make it harder to build wealth through employment. It is still unclear how this will play out over the long term. But this trend means it is more important than ever for people to acquire equity in public stocks to maintain access to the wealth-creating potential of big businesses. .Let's explore why a $1,000 bet on shares in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Realty Income (NYSE: O) could help investors preserve and grow their portfolios in this rapidly evolving economic landscape..With a market cap of $2.29 trillion, Amazon is already one of the largest companies in the world, and it isn't hard to see why. The diversified technology giant has had its fingers in many different megatrends, ranging from e-commerce to cloud computing, allowing it to achieve an incredible level of scale. Generative AI could unlock the next leg of growth. .Amazon's AI strategy has two parts. One side focuses on providing computing power to other enterprises through its cloud services segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The second involves using AI technology internally to boost business efficiency and customer satisfaction. .According to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon is already using generative AI in ""virtually every corner"" of its operations. Much of these efforts focus on relatively minor improvements like shopping assistants and automated product detail pages. But investors should probably be most excited about the potential for workforce reductions. Management believes AI will allow Amazon to shrink its workforce even further over the coming years, allowing for dramatic profit growth even if its top line plateaus..With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33, Amazon stock trades for a slight premium over the S&P 500's average of 29. But that looks fair, considering the company's dominant brand and profit growth potential..Unlike Amazon, Realty Income probably won't get a massive direct boost from AI technology -- although it has partnered with Digital Realty to build data centers. Nevertheless, the company is an excellent bet in this changing economy because its stable and diversified real estate portfolio helps ensure its business can thrive, no matter what happens.

The two are joining forces to create the largest authenticated footprint in connected TV..Amazon Ads and Roku are to enable advertisers to reach an estimated 80 million US households through the Amazon demand-side platform. The partnership aims to enable unprecedented precision at scale by allowing markets to access logged-in users across all apps and devices in a way that was not possible before..Early tests following the integration have already shown a 40% increase in unique reach and a 30% reduction in over-frequency. Consequently, advertisers delivered three times more value from their campaigns..Advertisers are set to benefit from better performance, planning, optimization, and measurement due to the extraordinary scale. Addressability across popular streaming apps, such as The Roku Channel, Prime Video, and other top CTV streaming services on Roku and Fire TV operating systems, has also received a boost owing to the exclusive alliance between two industry leaders in CTV..Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started as an online bookselling company. It has since morphed into an internet-based business enterprise that provides cloud computing, digital streaming and AI services, and an e-commerce platform. The platform operates in more than 20 countries worldwide..While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this online retailer have returned +4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%..The consensus earnings estimate of $6.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.15 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-amzn-trending-130004834.html

The stock, which took a tumble due to China-related issues, primarily related to the emergence of DeepSeek and new tariffs under President Donald Trump, has made a strong comeback and is just about 5% off from its record highs..Touted as the “Godfather of AI” by celebrated tech analyst Dan Ives, CEO Jensen Huang and his company are critical to not only the U.S.’s global prowess in chips, but are increasingly becoming key to diplomatic negotiations..2 Outstanding Stocks Under $50 to Buy and Hold Now.3 ETFs with Dividend Yields of 12% or Higher for Your Income Portfolio.Nvidia’s Bringing Sovereign AI to Germany.

Let’s find out..Not even a decade ago, Nvidia was a niche company, mostly popular among gamers for its GPUs. Now, after 10 years its shares have soared more than 28,000%, driving the company to a valuation above $3.5 trillion. Nvidia is also closing in on new record highs as it is just 5% shy of the record $153.13 set early in January..The company that designs and sells advanced chips and software platforms — primarily for AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous systems – counts tech majors such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and nearly every major AI and cloud company as its customer..From hyperscalers to sovereign AI, Nvidia is becoming more and more irreplaceable. Central to this are Nvidia’s Blackwell chips..According to Huang’s keynote at GTC 2025, “The Blackwell architecture significantly enhances AI model training and inference, enabling more efficient and scalable AI applications. And the next evolution of the Nvidia Blackwell AI factory platform, Blackwell Ultra, will be coming to systems in the second half of this year.”.Further bolstering its dominance in the GPU industry, where it already commands a near-monopoly with a-greater-than-90% market share, Nvidia has outlined a compelling product roadmap that is expected to reinforce its leadership position even more firmly. In addition to the Blackwell Ultra platform, the company is progressing toward launching next-generation GPU systems such as the Vera Rubin NVL144, which is anticipated in the second half of 2026, and the Rubin Ultra NVL576, scheduled for release a year later in late 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-quickly-approaching-record-high-113002880.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,Data center spending soared amid rising GPU demand in Q1,"AI infrastructure buildouts drove a 53% increase in capital expenditures, despite some project cancellations and tariff concerns, Dell’Oro Group said.","This story was originally published on CIO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter. .Data center capital expenditures increased 53% year over year to $134 billion during the first three months of 2025, according to Dell’Oro Group research published Tuesday. The spike was driven by a surge in hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure, particularly Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and custom accelerators, the research firm said..The four companies with the largest cloud footprints — AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft — accounted for 44% of Q1 data center capital investments. Enterprise infrastructure spending — the second biggest category — accounted for one-third of the total, according to Dell’Oro..“Despite some project cancellations by U.S. cloud providers, overall CapEx remains on track, with hyperscalers adjusting capacity rather than cutting investments,” Dell’Oro Group Senior Research Director Baron Fung said in the report. “Enterprises, facing tighter budgets and tariff-related risks, are more cautious, prompting slight downward revisions to their CapEx forecasts.”.An ongoing data center building boom sparked by generative AI adoption showed no signs of an early-year slowdown as hyperscalers raced to add compute capacity..Amazon reported $24.3 billion in Q1 capital expenditures, primarily to expand AWS’ AI cloud infrastructure. Microsoft and Google weren’t far behind, reporting $21.4 billion and $17 billion in CapEx for the first three months of the year, respectively..Dell’Oro Group expects the trend to continue. The firm forecasted a 30% year-over-year bump in data center investments for 2025, despite mixed economic signals triggered by tariff concerns and supply chain challenges. Last year, data center infrastructure capital expenditures grew 51% year over year to $455 billion..“Tariff-related uncertainties are not expected to materially alter hyperscaler spending plans given their diversified global supply chains,” Fung said in the report..AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud plan to invest more than $250 billion in buildouts this year, in part to ease capacity constraints and satisfy growing customer demand for AI processing power..“The availability of GPU and supporting infrastructure is supply constrained,” Fung said in an email. “Demand is so strong that the top 4 U.S. cloud service providers have had to turn away smaller customers.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-center-spending-soared-amid-111829996.html

Basically, all the puts would expire worthless and the trader keeps the $215 premium..A tent-shaped profit zone exists between $190 and $200 with the maximum gain occurring at $195 and is around $600..This is what the trade looks like as of today:.You can see the main risk in the trade is a drop in price early on. The blue line is the profit and loss at expiration and the purple line is the T+0 line. T+0 just means “today”..So, we don’t want the stock to get into the profit tent too early..What about in three weeks’ time? How does the trade look then?.Looking a lot better for any price above $195..One advantage of this trade type is it takes advantage of option skew. Notice the contract we are buying has lower volatility (65.16%) than the contract we are selling (64.45%). Buy low, sell high..Not that the trade starts with a delta of 9, which means the initial position is roughly equivalent to being long 9 shares of AMZN stock, although this will change as the trade progresses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ratio-spread-targets-profit-110002445.html

These are the types of companies that investors are drawn to because if they're growing, they are expanding their operations and likely innovating and potentially diversifying along the way. .Names like Amazon and Nvidia are two exceptional examples. Over the past 20 years, the former has produced returns of 12,000% while the latter is up more than 60,000%. Investing $30,000 into either one of the stocks back then would have made you millions of dollars. .Picking the next big growth stock is easier said than done. But the good news is that you don't have to pick the next Amazon or Nvidia to achieve great results. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will give you exposure to the top 100 nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq exchange, also known as the Nasdaq 100. Amazon, Nvidia, and many other top tech names are included in that list. .Here's how a $30,000 investment in the fund might grow over the long haul..The best growth stocks in the world are often found on the Nasdaq. And by targeting the top 100 nonfinancial companies, you won't have to worry about keeping an eye on which growth stocks to buy. The Invesco fund will adjust its holdings over time, removing poor-performing stocks and replacing them with rising stars..Some of the top holdings in the ETF today include Costco Wholesale, Netflix, and Broadcom. While it is a tech-heavy fund (tech stocks account for 57% of its holdings), about 20% of the portfolio is also in consumer discretionary stocks, followed by smaller positions in other sectors. And more than 97% of the holdings are U.S. stocks, which can minimize your exposure to international markets..It's little surprise, with so much focus on growth, that the Invesco QQQ Trust widely outperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade. At 430%, it has averaged a compound annual growth rate of more than 18%..As impressive as the Invesco ETF's returns have been over the past decade, they've also been skewed in recent years by a flurry of tech spending, which may not persist in the very long term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-30-000-investment-103000071.html

 .For corporations, the mood is growth, productivity, and shareholder value. But the news added fuel to the fiery concerns that AI will massively displace workers..The concern that machines will take jobs isn't new, of course. But the scope of change, and the potential for new modes of labor and invention, are driving the latest bout of anxiety in workers — amid the corporate excitement for employers..The current labor market, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed Wednesday, is solid. But the Fed is watching this space closely..Board Governor Michael Barr, in a speech at the Reykjavík Economic Conference last month, outlined a scenario where AI doesn't just inspire incremental progress but overhauls the economy, prompting sweeping social change..""The amazing potential capabilities and breadth of applications associated with AI — many of which are already apparent — make it worth asking whether this time may be different,"" Barr said. ""But alongside the kinds of labor market disruptions seen in past episodes of revolutionary technological change, we will need to consider the possibility of more sweeping changes in the way we work."".In his press conference Wednesday, responding to a question about the Amazon news, Fed Chair Powell stressed that the question is about whether the technology will ""augment"" or ""replace"" labor, which is ""really hard to know."".But, Powell stressed, ""I wouldn't overread a couple of data points, because AI should be creating jobs at the same time."".It's not clear yet how drastic the AI-inspired labor changes will be, but the data points are coming in and will continue..And the Fed, again in the ""wait and see"" mode afforded by a healthy labor market, can count them..""We don't have a house view on [AI taking jobs],"" Powell said.

It's up nearly 200,000% over its lifetime and 900% over the past 10 years..Everyone is talking about what it's doing in artificial intelligence (AI) today and how that could jump-start sales growth. There's a huge long-term opportunity, but can Amazon stock double over the next five years?.With all of the AI hype, let's not forget that Amazon's main business, for now at least, is e-commerce, where sales were $94 billion in the 2025 first quarter, accounting for more than 60% of total revenue..The company has a hold on U.S. e-commerce, and it's taking many actions to protect that moat and keep its dominant spot. Its Prime members count on that part of the business for their essentials purchases and more. It controls about 40% of the total U.S. e-commerce market, with the next-highest competitor, Walmart, at only around 6%..CEO Andy Jassy said that although it could be affected by new tariffs, shoppers tend to choose retailers they trust when there's uncertainty. And its huge base of sellers and product assortment mean that shoppers are likely to find the items they need at the price they want on its platform..As usual, Amazon reported increasing delivery speed in the 2025 first quarter, and it has made a number of changes to its logistics network to keep that up. It changed from a national network to a regional one, it keeps more of its highest-selling products closer to more shoppers, and uses AI throughout its business to determine fast and cheap shipping options..The company is testing new processes in a pilot distribution center that's cutting 25% of processing time and is on track to deliver 25% cost savings at peak times..E-commerce overall is expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% through 2029, according to Statista, and as the leader in the industry, much of that will land on Amazon's platform..Beyond e-commerce, the company has launched a hugely successful advertising business that leverages its unmatched e-commerce platform for consumer exposure to ads. It also now offers an ad-supported streaming tier on Prime Video through its ad business, with strong results so far.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-double-2030-095200618.html

2025-06-17 12:03:00,Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Amazon's share price and market cap are likely to increase significantly over the next five years.  Key growth drivers include AI, e-commerce penetration, advertising, and expansion into new markets.  It's definitely the answer to where Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock will be in five years.","Amazon's share price and market cap are likely to increase significantly over the next five years..Key growth drivers include AI, e-commerce penetration, advertising, and expansion into new markets..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.I don't know for sure. That's the answer to many questions I'm asked. It's definitely the answer to where Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock will be in five years..However, I think I have a pretty good overall take on where Amazon stock will be in 2030. If I'm right, the outlook looks highly encouraging for Amazon shareholders..I'll be quite surprised if Amazon's share price isn't significantly higher five years from now. Are we talking about a market cap of $3 trillion? $4 trillion? Even $5 trillion? Maybe, maybe, and maybe..Going back to Amazon's initial public offering in May 1997, there have only been two five-year periods during which the stock didn't deliver strong gains. Both occurred during the dot-com bubble burst in the early 21st century. In most of the other five-year periods in Amazon's history, its share price at least doubled and often skyrocketed threefold or more..As the mutual fund disclosures say, ""Past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future results."" That's true with Amazon (and any other stock, for that matter). In some ways, it gets increasingly difficult for companies like Amazon to extend their successful track records. Delivering robust growth is harder when your market cap is $2.3 trillion than when it's $100 billion..However, I'm reasonably confident predicting that Amazon will be bigger five years from now. Why? The same culture that was largely responsible for the company's success over the last nearly three decades is still in place today..I'll go beyond culture as a reason Amazon should grow significantly, though. There are five specific reasons I think Amazon stock will perform well over the next five years..First, I suspect we've only seen the tip of the iceberg of how artificial intelligence (AI) will transform the world. I expect the second half of this decade will be filled with one AI advance after another. Amazon will probably be one of the companies achieving those advances. And it will almost certainly be a big beneficiary of AI progress, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) ranking as the world's largest cloud services provider..Second, there's more room for Amazon to grow in its core e-commerce business than meets the eye. Sure, e-commerce is no longer new -- and Amazon is already the 800-pound gorilla in the market. However, CEO Andy Jassy hit the nail on the head in Amazon's October 2024 quarterly update when he pointed out that his company owned only around 1% of the global retail market. I think Jassy was also correct that a lot more retail will be done online in the next 10 to 20 years than is done now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-amazon-stock-5-years-085100009.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,Both of these stocks will benefit from increased AI spending in the years to come.,"The growth in AI spending is not slowing down, presenting an opportunity for cloud computing stocks..Amazon is the leading cloud provider and is seeing fast revenue growth..Alphabet can benefit from both consumer and cloud AI in the future..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.The artificial intelligence (AI) train shows no signs of slowing down. Spending on the category is expected to grow 5x over the next five years, according to a recent report from Grand View Research. That increased AI spending has been and will continue to be a boon for the cloud computing giants. That's because start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic perform AI model training and run inference for consumer usage through cloud computing systems. And huge capital expenditures on data centers should help growth continue at this blistering pace in 2025..But who are the cloud computing giants benefiting from this AI surge? Two of them happen to be well-known for other reasons and have a history of being millionaire-maker stocks. Here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can continue to be millionaire-maker stocks going forward with the help of AI and the cloud..Amazon is making investments on the consumer side of AI with its e-commerce platform, but the majority of its investments are with its cloud computing division, called Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the premier partner for Anthropic, one of the leading start-ups in the AI space, where Amazon has invested billions of dollars. With these investments, Anthropic will pour money into training and running AI systems on AWS. A long-term partnership such as this will be vital for AWS. Anthropic may spend tens of billions of dollars on cloud computing credits in the years to come..Revenue growth accelerated for AWS in recent quarters as companies flock to the cloud computing leader to host their AI systems. AWS revenue grew 17% year over year last quarter to $29.3 billion, bringing annualized revenue to $117 billion. Profits are soaring because of this spending, sending operating income to $42 billion over the last 12 months just for the AWS segment..Growth should continue in 2025 and beyond. Amazon said it plans to spend $100 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, mostly related to AI at AWS. This increased data center capacity will help revenue keep scaling at a rapid clip. Accompanied by strong profit margins, this will be a huge earnings growth driver for Amazon over the next few years..Add in the durable growth in e-commerce, and Amazon stock looks like a perfect stock to own over the long term. It has a slightly expensive forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35, but that should come down quickly with better margins at e-commerce and steady growth at AWS. Buy Amazon stock and sit tight; you likely will be well rewarded in the future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-millionaire-maker-artificial-intelligence-082000858.html

The company has aggressively pursued faster shipping speeds through the years as it aims to separate itself from retail rivals like Walmart and spur more customer orders..To deliver fast, Amazon first needs to accurately forecast demand and position the right amount of inventory in the right location..The company's previous forecasting systems used sales history to guide planning decisions, but its new foundational AI forecasting model — currently used in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil — leans additional data to strengthen accuracy. This includes factoring in regional differences, like demand for ski goggles in Boulder, Colorado, during the peak ski season..""These forecasts have contributed to a 10% improvement in long-term national forecasts for deal events, and a 20% improvement in regional forecasts for millions of popular items,"" Amazon said..When items are delivered, drivers are now tapping into Wellspring, Amazon's generative AI mapping technology.

Though these companies have helped shareholders score a major win quarter after quarter and could continue to climb, some investors now are looking beyond these names that have constantly been on center stage. They aim to find the next big AI success story, and one that has emerged in recent times is CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV)..This tech company is new to the market, having launched its initial public offering in March, and the stock already has soared more than 320% from that point. Investors are excited about this new AI investing opportunity, especially considering the company has been delivering triple-digit revenue growth. Could investing $10,000 in CoreWeave make you a millionaire? Let's find out..So, first, let's talk a little bit about this new-to-the-market company that's outperformed well-established tech giants such as the Magnificent Seven companies so far this year. CoreWeave actually is closely linked to the world's most talked-about AI company, Nvidia, and this may be part of the reason why investors are so excited about its future..This company's main business is offering customers access to its giant fleet -- 250,000 to be exact -- of Nvidia chips across more than 30 data centers. These graphics processing units (GPUs) may be rented for long periods of time or simply by hour, offering customers great flexibility for their AI workloads. Since demand has been extremely high, even surpassing supply, for Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture and chip, investors clearly are optimistic about CoreWeave's prospects too. CoreWeave even was the first to make this new architecture generally available to customers, highlighting its ability to serve customers fast with the latest innovations..And the fact that market giant Nvidia holds a 7% stake in CoreWeave is another element that could appeal to investors. Nvidia's backing suggests this young company is set to play a key role in the next phases of the AI story..A look at CoreWeave's growth so far shows great momentum, with revenue soaring more than 400% in the first quarter. And even considering uncertainties in recent months that have pressured the stock market, CoreWeave says customer demand still increased. In fact, the big challenge right now is to scale up and meet demand. This requires significant investment, and that means investors should expect spending to increase moving forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-investing-10-000-coreweave-071500434.html

The 40% plunge from the same month last year marks a sharp reversal for a booming trade route, coming just as the US government eliminated a long-standing tariff loophole..The policy shift is upending the business models of fast-fashion titan Shein and its rival Temu, which relied on the exemption to send goods directly to US customers free of tariffs. It’s also squeezing thousands of small merchants who relied on the model as a low-cost entry into the world’s largest consumer market..“Without the exemption, it would mean tougher business to us, and much fewer options for consumers, and potentially higher prices,” said Wang Yuhao, whose Kunming-based incense company, Shantivale, recently began selling to the US. “This is a lose-lose situation.”.For the entrepreneur, the new tariffs and logistical fees of direct shipping now would mean losing $2 on every parcel. To avoid the additional cost, Wang said he has pivoted to bulk shipments to US warehouses, a move that demanded an upfront investment of more than 100,000 yuan ($13,800) for inventory and storage..The source of the disruption is the end of the “de minimis” rule exemption for Chinese and Hong Kong shipments. Previously, packages valued under $800 could enter the US duty-free. Since May 2, those parcels face tariffs as high as 54% after the Trump administration moved to close what it deemed an unfair trade loophole..The impact on the largest players was swift. Shein raised US prices on items from dresses to kitchenware ahead of the hike to cover the costs of the higher tariffs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. In the week after the tariffs took effect, both Shein and Temu saw double-digit sales declines, an early sign the punitive measures are eroding their popularity..Even with the drop, the US remained the largest single destination for China’s small parcels, the data showed.

The streaming landscape continues evolving rapidly, with both companies investing heavily in content, technology, and new revenue streams like advertising and live events.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Netflix's investment thesis centers on its position as the dominant pure-play streaming platform with significant operating leverage and multiple emerging growth drivers. The company's first-quarter 2025 performance demonstrated strong fundamentals, with healthy subscriber growth and robust retention metrics despite economic headwinds. Management emphasized that engagement remains strong, with no significant changes in plan mix or churn patterns, showcasing the platform's resilience.The advertising opportunity represents Netflix's most compelling growth catalyst. The company expects to roughly double its advertising revenues in 2025, driven by its proprietary ad tech platform rollout across markets. With ads currently representing a small fraction of total revenues, this business line offers substantial upside as Netflix expands programmatic capabilities and enhanced targeting features. The ad-supported tier starting at $7.99 provides accessibility during economic uncertainty while creating new monetization avenues.Netflix's content strategy continues to strengthen its competitive moat. Recent announcements include major investments exceeding 1 billion euros in Spain through 2028, new partnerships like the TF1 Group distribution deal in France, and an expanding pipeline of original content across multiple genres and regions. The company's live events strategy, including the successful NFL Christmas games and upcoming Taylor-Serrano fight, demonstrates its ability to create water-cooler moments that drive subscriber acquisition and retention.The gaming initiative, while still nascent, represents another growth vector with minimal cannibalization risk. Netflix's approach focuses on premium, ad-free gaming experiences tied to popular IP, potentially unlocking value from the $140 billion gaming market over time.Management has also set ambitious but achievable targets, including doubling revenues by 2030 and achieving $9 billion in annual advertising revenues by the same year. The company's advertising business represents a significant growth opportunity, with the successful launch of Netflix's Ad Suite in the United States on April 1 and international expansion planned for this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025, creating a new revenue stream that complements its successful subscription model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.32 per share, indicating 27.69% growth year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-vs-amazon-streaming-giant-154400134.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,Shoppers say they’re ‘not interested’ in Amazon’s longer Prime Day sale,Could making the 2025 Amazon Prime Day event four days long backfire? Here’s what retail analysts think.,"Is this really a prime time for a shopping event?.After all, U.S. retail sales took a hit for a second straight month in May. The trade wars remain largely in effect, with President Donald Trump’s tariff pause due to end in July. Plus, there’s now a major conflict between Israel and Iran, which is already causing some global economic jitters..‘I’m at my wit’s end’: My niece paid off her husband’s credit card but fell behind on her taxes. How can I help her?.Why the biggest-ever ‘triple witching’ options expiration could deliver a jolt to Friday’s trading.Israel-Iran clash delivers a fresh shock to investors.

How do I cut her out of her will?.I’m 75 and have a reverse mortgage. Should I pay it off with my $200K savings — and live off Social Security instead?.And yet, Amazon AMZN is set to expand its July Prime Day shopping event from two to four days, banking on consumer sentiment to be strong enough in spite of all these obstacles..Retail analysts and experts who spoke with MarketWatch are fairly bullish on Amazon’s  strategy. But shoppers appear to be signaling some caution, based on survey data..Amazon announced the Prime Day expansion this week, setting the event for July 8-11 and saying it’s a boon for shoppers. “With an extended four-day event, our Prime members will have more time and flexibility to conveniently shop, while enjoying exclusive deals and incredible savings,” an Amazon spokesperson told MarketWatch..Certainly, the company has fared very well over the years with its summertime retail extravaganza. Last year’s two-day event saw consumers spend $14.2 billion, setting a new record for the event, according to data from Adobe Analytics. Prime Day 2024 was subsequently described by Amazon as its “biggest Prime Day shopping event ever.”.But there are certainly headwinds going into the expanded summer 2025 event — and that perhaps explains why consumers seem skittish..A new RetailMeNot survey found that interest in Prime Day should remain strong — 84% of U.S. shoppers say they plan to participate, up from 81% in 2024. But the survey also showed that those shoppers won’t be digging as deep into their wallets, with the anticipated spend at Amazon being $242 during the event, a decline of $58 from the previous year..Polls conducted by MarketWatch on various social-media platforms Tuesday showed limited enthusiasm for a four-day Prime Day event. On X, far more respondents said they were “not interested” in the extended sale versus those who said they “love” the idea. MarketWatch polls on both Instagram and WhatsApp found that the majority of survey respondents voted “Not interested [in the expanded Prime Day event] because I need to save money right now.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shoppers-not-interested-amazon-longer-173500566.html

It’s already happening, quietly and behind the scenes. The tactic is called surveillance pricing, and it uses your personal data to determine how much you’re charged. “Businesses may be using this trove of personal information to charge each of us a different price for the exact same product or service,” she explained..Our phones and computers collect huge amounts of data on us every day. Companies tap into that data—like your location, income level, browsing habits, even your mouse movements—to figure out your “pain point,” or the highest price you’re likely to pay..“And unlike being in a physical store where you generally see the same price tag as everyone else,” Khan said, “online shopping is an individualized experience.”.The goal?

What's unique, however, is that the usual suspects of Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon aren't really pegged to the rising interest in quantum computing technology..Rather, a new cohort of rising stars such as Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) are among the most popular quantum computing stocks right now. With shares down by 25% from their peak over the last year, IonQ stock trades for roughly $40 as of this writing. Is now a good opportunity to pounce on the stock?.Quantum computing is not a widely used application in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Yet despite its developmental stage, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that quantum computing could be a $131 billion opportunity in the coming decades. With the potential for such enormous upside, it's not entirely surprising that investors were quick to look at which companies are involved with quantum computing development..One reason that I think IonQ has emerged as a favorite in the quantum computing market is the company's impressive partnerships with cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. With the stock sliding as of late, investors may be wondering if the sell-off is an opportunity to buy the dip..Despite working with major AI developers, IonQ has little to show in terms of tangible growth. Over the last year, the company has only generated $43 million in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's net losses are in the hundreds of millions (and worsening)..In a way, this financial profile actually makes some sense. As I alluded to above, quantum computing is not yet commercially used in AI development. Given those dynamics, IonQ's revenue potential is fairly limited for the time being. The unfortunate reality is that the company will likely remain a high-cash-burn operation as it continues building out its platform..But still, for just $40 could IonQ be worth a look? Well, smart investors understand that the stock price alone does not determine the worth of a business. As of this writing, IonQ boasts a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. This implies that IonQ is trading for a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 195.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-25-now-time-pounce-110000459.html

With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: Novo Nordisk Backs Away From Hims & Hers Partnership and Fiserv Connecting Thousands of Banks to Crypto with New Stablecoin Platform.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

Digital media has transformed advertising. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are the biggest winners in the industry, but there are others benefiting as well, including ad tech companies taking advantage of continued growth in areas such as connected TV, retail media, better ad targeting, and improvements enabled by AI..Keep reading for more details on two of these ad tech stocks that can make investors a fortune..There's no getting around it: Roku's (NASDAQ: ROKU) performance disappointed investors in recent years. Roku's stock price remains down more than 80% from its peak in 2021. That's when the pandemic-driven boom quickly faded as the economy reopened and the streaming industry's surging growth hit a wall..Roku was forced to do several rounds of layoffs, having overspent during the pandemic. But the business and the streaming industry more broadly underwent a reset and are prepared for growth. Netflix's stock soared to an all-time high recently as its ad tier has taken off. Walt Disney is now making a profit in its streaming division, and the stock recently hit a 52-week high, while Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, one focused on studios and the other on streaming..Streaming services appear to be moving past their post-pandemic struggles, and Roku should benefit. Despite the stock's woes, the business continues to deliver solid growth, with revenue up 16% year over year in the first quarter to $1.02 billion, and its bottom line is improving as well. The company also expects to report an operating profit using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) metrics..There are also other signs of building momentum. The stock price jumped on Monday after the company announced an exclusive integration with Amazon's demand side platform, and it's also gaining share of listings on retail sites such as Amazon and Target, a sign that it's probably gaining market share as well..As the leading streaming distribution platform, Roku is well-positioned to capitalize on continued growth in connected TV, and at a market cap of $11 billion, the stock could easily double, triple, or better from here, especially if it hits its profit goal.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ad-tech-stocks-could-080000461.html

Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time.,"Amazon is using artificial intelligence to strengthen its e-commerce business..Apple has a growing installed base of devices and is generating nearly $100 billion in annual profit..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time. From 1965 through 2024, Buffett guided Berkshire Hathaway stock to an astounding 5,502,284% cumulative return, smashing the S&P 500 index's 39,054% return..Although Buffett will be retiring at the end of this year, Berkshire's stock holdings are full of competitively strong companies that can grow your savings. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are dominant tech firms with millions of loyal customers. If you have $1,000 to invest right now, these are excellent stocks to anchor a well-diversified portfolio..Berkshire has held a stake in the leading e-commerce and cloud computing provider since 2019. Amazon has multiple high-margin revenue streams that make it a solid investment for a long-term investor. The stock has returned 66% over the last five years and should continue to grow in value..Amazon's e-commerce and cloud services form a potent combination. It's important to understand that e-commerce is the largest revenue driver, totaling 38% of the company's $650 billion of trailing-12-month revenue, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) generates most of the company's $71 billion of trailing operating profit..AWS is seeing strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) services for enterprises, but Amazon is also leveraging this technology for its e-commerce business..For example, the company uses AI to forecast demand for products and allocate its inventory where it is needed most. This ultimately leads to faster delivery speeds, satisfied customers, and greater cost efficiencies that benefit profit margin..Amazon's operating income increased 20% year over year in the first quarter. The strong growth it is seeing in other profitable businesses like advertising and third-party fulfillment services is also having an impact on Amazon's bottom line and could justify a higher share price..Berkshire still held 10 million shares of Amazon in the first quarter. The stock's price-to-earnings multiple of 35 is the lowest in over 10 years, making it a compelling buy right now..Buffett originally invested in Apple stock in 2016, and it's been one of Berkshire's most successful investments in its history.

These include smarter voice assistants, AI-driven shopping features, and advanced developer tools for AI model training and deployment..The company’s AI-powered shopping assistant is now used by tens of millions globally, while half a million sellers are making use of AI support to optimise listings..Internally, generative AI is being applied to areas such as inventory placement, forecasting, robotics, and customer service chatbots. These tools are credited with improving efficiency and reducing operational costs..Jassy stated that the shift toward AI will change how work is carried out at Amazon, likely reducing the number of employees required for certain corporate roles..He did not specify which departments will be affected or when reductions might begin but emphasised that the company will require more workers in areas aligned with AI development and oversight..“As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.”.Jassy highlighted the potential of generative AI agents—systems capable of performing complex tasks on behalf of users—as a central focus of Amazon’s innovation strategy..These agents are expected to support customers and staff by automating tasks such as summarising research, writing code, and generating insights..Amazon aims to operate “like the world’s largest start-up,” according to Jassy, pushing for faster innovation, leaner teams, and increased ownership at all levels..Employees are being encouraged to engage with AI tools, attend training sessions, and contribute to the company’s evolving technology initiatives.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-reduces-staff-ai-grows-071544576.html

However, the index has historically rebounded sharply following those incidences, producing an average 12-month return of 21% following corrections since 2010..More broadly, the Nasdaq Composite has returned 11% annually over the last four decades. That suggests the index is headed much higher in the future..Buying stock in The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is a smart way for patient investors to lean into that possibility. Wall Street's median target price of $84 per share implies 23% upside from the current share price of $68..Here are the important details..The Trade Desk is an adtech company that operates the largest independent demand-side platform (DSP), software that helps businesses plan, measure, and optimize data-driven advertising campaigns across digital channels. The company has a particularly strong presence in two of the fastest-growing advertising verticals: connected TV (CTV) and retail media..The Trade Desk's independent business model -- meaning it does not own media content and has no reason to steer clients toward specific advertising inventory -- is an important advantage. It distinguishes the company from rivals like Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, all of which have an incentive to sell their own ad inventory to media buyers, whether or not it's the best option..Frost & Sullivan analysts recently recognized The Trade Desk as the most technologically sophisticated DSP on the market. The company has been building artificial intelligence (AI) into its software for years. Its 2023 launch of the Kokai platform introduced new AI features that let agencies manage budgets, prioritize ad impressions, and target consumers..CEO Jeff Green said Kokai adoption was ""ahead of schedule"" on the first-quarter earnings call, and he thinks all clients will be using the platform by year-end. The Trade Desk is monetizing AI in other ways as well. Its recent partnership with Rembrand will allow brands to use generative AI to create advertising content. That partnership expands its existing generative AI marketplace.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-says-nasdaq-soar-1-071200158.html

The proposal, already tucked into the House version of Trump's budget bill, is being sold as a way to avoid a messy patchwork of state-level rules that could slow innovation and leave the U.S. trailing China. Their message: keep regulation federal, uniform, and minimalfor now.

Chip Pickering, INCOMPAS CEO, said the move is about safeguarding America's lead in AI..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN..But not everyone's buying that narrative. Criticsincluding academics, policy analysts, and even some in Silicon Valleyargue this could be less about innovation and more about locking in dominance. MIT's Max Tegmark called it a power grab, while voices from the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator warned that defanging state oversight now could make AI's societal risks harder to manage later.

Others, like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Josh Hawley, say tying states' hands for a decadewhen no one knows where AI is headedcould backfire hard..The Senate is now weighing how to fit this moratorium into a budget reconciliation bill, which bypasses the need for Democratic votes. Senator Ted Cruz has floated a workaround: cut broadband funding to states that refuse to comply. But the clock is ticking, and the political ground is far from firm.

We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a memo to employees..“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”.Jassy said Amazon is “using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations” for tasks like inventory management and demand forecasting in its delivery system..The CEO said, because of AI, “We’ll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.” The comments were met with backlash from employees..Some of Amazon's corporate employees are facing an order to relocate closer to their managers and teams, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

(AMZN) is ordering some corporate employees to move closer to their managers and teams, roiling a workforce already worried about job cuts and warnings from the top that artificial intelligence will shrink their ranks in the coming years..Most Read from Bloomberg.Security Concerns Hit Some of the World’s ‘Most Livable Cities’.JFK AirTrain Cuts Fares 50% This Summer to Lure Riders Off Roads.Taser-Maker Axon Triggers a NIMBY Backlash in its Hometown.How E-Scooters Conquered (Most of) Europe.NYC Congestion Toll Cuts Manhattan Gridlock by 25%, RPA Reports.Workers are being told to relocate to such cities as Seattle; Arlington, Virginia; and Washington DC, which in some cases would require them to move across the country, according to people familiar with the situation. Amazon is mostly rolling out the mandate in one-on-one meetings and town halls rather than sending out a mass email, said the people, who requested anonymity because they aren’t authorized to discuss company plans..One of the people said the relocation policy will affect thousands of employees on several teams. Mid-career professionals with children in school and partners in established careers are reluctant to make big moves in light of Amazon’s belt-tightening efforts..An Amazon spokesperson said “for more than a year now, some teams have been working to bring their teammates closer together to help them be as effective as possible, but there isn’t a one-size-fits all approach and there hasn’t been a change in our approach as a company.”.Amazon employees have been sharing information about the relocation mandate on the company’s internal slack channels, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. One employee said their manager informed the team of the need to relocate and told them they had 30 days to make a decision. Then they had 60 days to either resign or begin their relocation process, according to the person, who said they were told there would be no severance for employees who resigned in lieu of relocating..The company spokesperson said “we hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances.”.When Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy ordered employees to return to the office five days a week beginning earlier this year, there was no requirement that they move to specific offices. Amazon has satellite workplaces around the country, including major metropolitan areas like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Dallas and Austin, giving workers some flexibility about where they lived. Many employees were hired to fully remote positions during the pandemic.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-orders-employees-relocate-seattle-212945920.html

It's likely investors believe Amazon's AI-forward message will be beneficial for Symbotic, too.","Today, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that Amazon's workforce would shrink going forward due to AI and automation..While Amazon isn't a Symbotic customer, its competitors Walmart and Target are..It's likely investors believe Amazon's AI-forward message will be beneficial for Symbotic, too..10 stocks we like better than Symbotic ›.Shares of robotics giant Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) rallied about 16% on Wednesday as of 3 p.m. EDT..There wasn't much in the way of company-specific news today; however, a comment from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy may have made investors more bullish on the future of warehouse automation and robotics. Considering Symbotic's leadership in the space and low public float, the stock made a dramatic move higher on the news..Today, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a memo to employees, describing how Amazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to its benefit across its entire business empire, from the Amazon retail site to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, to its fulfillment network. Over time, Jassy stated, ""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs."".Specifically regarding Amazon's warehouses, Jassy noted, ""In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots--all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed."".Why would that lead to such a big surge in Symbotic's stock? Well, for all its big customers, including Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Target, and grocery chain Albertsons, investors may have been a bit unsure exactly how big Symbotic's business can get. So, Jassy's comments today may have increased conviction that fully automated warehouses are, in fact, the future..In addition, Symbotic's publicly traded float accounts for a relatively small amount of total shares outstanding. As of last September's annual report, the company's public A shares only comprise 18% of all shares outstanding, with the remainder held by the company's founders and large customer Walmart. Additionally, that small float had a high short interest on it, with roughly 40% of the public float and 15% of total shares outstanding sold short. So, today's positive sentiment change may be forcing short sellers to cover, turbo-charging the rally..When factoring in the non-public shares, Symbotic trades at about 10 times trailing-12-month sales, while profitability is still a touch below breakeven.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-symbotic-rocketed-16-higher-193300936.html

The company expects the plant will create hundreds of jobs in the region as it grows..“The reality is we are just ready,” Zoox Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech on Wednesday. The strategy is to start “putting the capacity in place and then turning it on little by little as we go city by city” with commercial launches, she said..Zoox is one of several companies vying to secure a foothold in the market for autonomous ridehailing. Competitors include Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit and Tesla Inc., which plans to begin offering rides in Austin with no driver behind the wheel as early as Sunday..The Amazon-owned company’s purpose-built robotaxi is akin to a shuttle and has no steering wheel or pedals, with four inward-facing seats. Zoox would need an exemption from US auto safety rules that require vehicles to have driver controls, though the Trump administration has said it’s working on changes to provide those approvals faster..Zoox is “very grateful” to the administration’s work in preparing the US for robotaxis and talks with regulatory bodies are “going well”, Evans said..Zoox is testing or operating robotaxis on a limited basis in San Fransisco and Las Vegas, where it plans to launch its service. Waymo, which uses vehicles made by other automakers that it rigs with self-driving software and sensors, is seen as the market leader and charges fares for rides in multiple US markets..To start, Zoox has a dozen of its robotaxis driving on the Las Vegas Strip, Evans said.

2025-06-17 12:03:00,Disney's New Amazon Deal: Does Ad Targeting Upgrade Justify a Buy?,"DIS' Amazon partnership enhances ad targeting, but the impact is delayed until 2026. Strong Q2 shows progress, yet competition persists. Hold or wait for 2025 entry.","Disney's DIS recent partnership with Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Ads represents a strategic move to enhance its advertising capabilities, but investors should exercise patience before adding shares to their portfolios. While the integration of Disney's Real-Time Ad Exchange with Amazon's demand-side platform promises improved ad targeting and revenue optimization, the deal alone does not constitute a compelling reason to buy Disney stock at current levels.The partnership, announced at the Cannes Lions Festival, grants Amazon DSP direct access to premium inventory across Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu platforms. This makes Amazon only the third demand-side platform, alongside Google and The Trade Desk, to integrate with Disney's DRAX system. The collaboration enables advertisers to combine Disney's audience data with Amazon's extensive commerce insights, creating more precise targeting capabilities that could theoretically command higher advertising rates..The Amazon partnership addresses a critical need for Disney's advertising business as the company seeks to maximize revenues from its ad-supported streaming tiers. By leveraging Amazon's commerce data, Disney can offer advertisers more sophisticated targeting options, potentially reducing ad frequency for consumers while improving campaign effectiveness. This enhanced capability could prove valuable as Madison Avenue grapples with an oversupply of connected TV inventory, particularly as more streaming services introduce ad-supported options.However, the integration's impact on Disney's financial performance remains uncertain. The partnership will launch with select advertisers in the third quarter of 2025, meaning meaningful revenue contributions are unlikely to materialize until fiscal 2026. Additionally, while the deal expands Disney's addressable advertising market internationally to countries, including France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, the advertising business remains a relatively small portion of Disney's overall revenues compared to its Experiences and traditional content businesses.The announcement follows Disney's solid second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance, which demonstrated the company's continued execution across its strategic priorities. Revenues increased 7% to $23.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share grew 20% compared to the prior year. The Entertainment segment showed particular strength with operating income rising 61 percent, driven by improved Direct-to-Consumer results and Content Sales/Licensing performance.Disney's streaming business continues its trajectory toward profitability, with Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer operating income reaching $336 million in the quarter. The company ended the period with more than 180 million Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, representing an increase of 2.5 million from the previous quarter.

The chairman’s net worth surged by more than $40 billion, outpacing the wealth of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and reaching a high of $250.9 billion. But he’ll have a hard time topping the riches of his close friend Elon Musk, who sits on a cool $405.8 billion fortune..No one was in a better mood last week than Larry Ellison—the Oracle cofounder shot up Forbes’ billionaire rankings list, reaching the number two spot, right below his close friend Elon Musk..Ellison’s net worth now stands tall at $250.9 billion after Oracle’s recent earnings report triggered its shares to skyrocket..With approximately 41% of Oracle’s shares in his name, the cloud-computing mogul saw his net worth climb by over $40 billion in a matter of days. On Thursday last week, his fortune grew by $25 billion, and increased by another $16 billion on Friday: easily two of the largest daily swells in billionaire net worth that week, according to Forbes. .Now Ellison has overtaken Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, who is currently worth $229 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg, who has a $240 billion net worth, in the billionaires club..The one person he hasn’t topped yet is Elon Musk—Ellison’s close friend, who is still the world’s wealthiest man with $405 billion in riches. There’s nearly a $155 billion difference between their respective net worths, so Ellison has his work cut out for him if he ever hopes to reach number one..Last Wednesday, the afternoon earnings report was dubbed a “watershed” moment for the cloud-computing company. It was also a big moment for Ellison’s wallet..The report shows Oracle’s total revenue for the 2025 fiscal year rose by 8%, reaching a whopping $57.4 billion. The $1.70 adjusted earnings per share outperformed Wall Street’s expectations, alongside its unprecedented $15.9 billion in sales. One day after these figures were released, Oracle’s stock soared by 13%—and by midafternoon Friday, it rose another 7% to a record of $215 per share..Ellison, the chairman and CTO of Oracle, subsequently enjoyed an 11-figure surge in net worth. Last Tuesday afternoon, the day before the cloud-computing titan released its earnings report, Ellison’s net worth stood at $213 billion..While the 80-year-old entrepreneur may feel on top of the world right now, there’s no telling where he’ll be in 2026. Billionaires’ wealth fluctuates all the time—Bernard Arnault, founder and CEO of luxury fashion house LVMH, was the world’s richest person at the start of 2024 with $231 billion.

2025-06-17 12:03:00,Amazon CEO: AI agents will shrink staff but improve CX,"Generative AI’s ability to remove rote work could help the retailer focus on the user experience, but will reduce the number of people required for today’s jobs, along the way.","This story was originally published on CX Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CX Dive newsletter. .Amazon expects its generative AI investments to continue improving its customers’ experience — and eventually shrink its workforce, CEO Andy Jassy in a blog post Tuesday..Jassy highlighted several existing customer-facing applications of the technology, including Alexa+, an updated version of the Alexa personal assistant; Buy for Me, a tool that can purchase eligible products from third-party sites without customers leaving the Amazon Shopping app; and Rufus, its AI shopping assistant..The company will also deploy AI agents to help employees do their jobs. These “agents are going to change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers,” Jassy wrote. “We’ll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.”.Amazon has said what many other businesses deploying AI to improve CX haven’t: AI advancements will likely lead to job cuts..“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”.But by building AI agents, the company will be able to make customers’ lives easier, “and it’s going to make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today,” Jassy said..Amazon has rebuilt its customer service chatbot with generative AI, according to Jassy. The company first added the generative AI chatbot Q to its customer service operations in 2023 to recommend responses and actions for agents..“What started as deep conviction that every customer experience would be reinvented using AI, and that altogether new experiences we’ve only dreamed of would become possible, is rapidly becoming reality,” Jassy said..While Jassy didn’t provide an exact number or which areas of the business would be affected, one job threatened by AI across multiple industries is the customer service agent. However, experts have warned that making people available is essential to driving AI adoption, so while AI can improve self-service, it isn’t in a position to replace live agents.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ceo-ai-agents-shrink-145816566.html

Amazon said earlier this month that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania..In March Amazon began testing artificial intelligence-aided dubbing for select movies and shows offered on its Prime streaming service. A month earlier, the company rolled out a generative-AI infused Alexa..Amazon has also invested more heavily in AI. In November the company said that it was investing an additional $4 billion in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.

In his view, consumer spending habits haven’t yet reflected what he calls “irrational economic policy.”.“If you didn’t know all of this was going on, I’m not sure you would know what’s going on,” Galloway said, referring to President Donald Trump‘s policies and global instability.

Job growth has been revised downward in recent months, and more people are quietly dropping out of the labor force. For job seekers, it’s already feeling like a recession..One key reason for the economy’s resilience, according to Edwards, is that the threats haven't fully materialized yet. “Trump has more bark than bite,” she said. “Were he to pursue [his policies] fully... we’d start to see declines in the labor force, massive shortages, and reductions in government spending.”.In short, the damage hasn't kicked in because many of the policies are still just talk.

We've heard from several companies over recent weeks, whose results we'll include as part of the broader Q2 tally..Among the group that have already reported, Oracle saw a notably strong reaction thanks to its robust results, with shares seeing a strong move higher post-earnings. Up nearly 30% YTD, shares are now outperforming the S&P 500 following the print..Let's take a closer look at the release and a few other major cloud players, such as Microsoft and Amazon..Concerning headline expectations in the release, sales of $15.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.70 both cleared our consensus expectations, reflecting growth rates of 11% and 4.3%, respectively..Notably, its remaining performance obligations (RPOs) were up a strong 41% year-over-year, a reflection of the red-hot demand the company has been witnessing..CEO Safra Catz said –.""We expect our total cloud growth rate—applications plus infrastructure—will increase from 24% in FY25 to over 40% in FY26. Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26. And RPO is likely to grow more than 100% in FY26. Oracle is well on its way to being not only the world's largest cloud application company — but also one of the world's largest cloud infrastructure companies."".The red-hot demand is also showing up in analysts' current year sales expectations, which have moved considerably higher following the release. Sales expectations were already trending higher for some time, with the recent commentary cementing the strong outlook..Microsoft shares have been strong in 2025 so far, up 14% compared to the S&P 500's 2% gain. Concerning headline figures in its latest release, EPS of $3.46 and sales of $70.0 billion both handily exceeded our consensus expectations, up 13% and 18%, respectively..The technology titan's sales growth continues to be mighty impressive, a common theme among the broader Mag 7 group overall..Strength in Microsoft Cloud and AI drove the results, with Microsoft Cloud revenue up 20% year-over-year to $42.4 billion.

This time, the memo was from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. It was posted publicly to Amazon’s website on Tuesday..Most Read from Fast Company.Housing market weakness triggers Lennar to offer biggest incentives since 2009.What’s behind the rise in interim CEOs.Kroger is giving away 92,000 pints of free ice cream today. Here’s how to get yours.Tech CEOs have been rattling off these love letters from time to time lately, and they usually sound similar: They talk about how the technology is “transformative,” how chatbots will somehow benefit customers, how it will make their company more “efficient” because AI will enable them to lay off more humans, and, most ominously, how “this is just the beginning.”.We get the gist: CEOs of large companies love the bottom line and AI is going to do wonders for it..But since Jassy is the CEO of the largest online retailer on the planet, his all-too-samey memo raises a burning question: Who is going to buy all of Amazon’s products once AI takes most of our jobs?.Jassy does admit in the memo that AI is going to cost people jobs at Amazon. Speaking about how the company is rolling out AI agents—artificially intelligent programs that will do the work a company used to pay human workers to do—Jassy said that Amazon “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.”.He goes on: “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”.Jassy is likely right that AI is going to reduce the total corporate workforce, but not just at Amazon. AI will reduce the total workforce at many companies in the years ahead, likely the majority of them..Estimates vary, but a 2023 report from investment bank Goldman Sachs said that AI could threaten 300 million jobs over a 10-year period. A 2017 report from McKinsey stated that the automation of jobs could result in between 400 million and 800 million individuals being displaced by 2030..“Automation” refers to the process by which code or robotics perform a task that a human was once required for, and often at a much lower operating cost than what a company would need to pay an individual..So, again, if every company in the world does what Amazon plans to do—replace workers with AI—and that does lead to a potential billion or so white-collar workers seeing their jobs evaporate, who exactly is Amazon going to sell to?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/going-shop-amazon-once-ai-124200936.html

Doing so puts things in perspective. Corrections appear as pretty minor blips on a chart of the S&P 500's long-term performance, which consistently moves upward for those who wait long enough..That's why panic selling is never a good solution to market volatility. Even in challenging times, it's worth it to purchase shares of excellent companies that can perform well over 10 years or more. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)are two notable examples..Amazon started as a modest online bookstore, expanded into broader e-commerce offerings, and then launched its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2006. More recently, it made a significant impact in the artificial intelligence (AI) market..Here's where it gets interesting: The company arguably still has massive whitespace in each of those industries. E-commerce made up 16.2% of total retail transactions in the U.S., as of the first quarter..It hasn't peaked yet. Analysts continue to project that the e-commerce market will expand at a good clip..Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that more than 85% of IT spending still occurs on-premises, i.e., not in the cloud. And the recent AI explosion is also just beginning..These are opportunities Amazon could ride for well beyond the next 10 years. And what's even more promising is that Amazon's newer opportunities carry higher margins than its legacy e-commerce business. As of the end of 2024, the segment had an annualized run rate of $115 billion. That doesn't seem that impressive compared to Amazon's total sales of almost $638 billion it reported last year..But AWS is growing faster than the rest of the business, already accounts for over 50% of the company's operating income, and by 2035 should make up a far larger percentage of its top line, leading to even even greater profits and margins. Amazon's AI business will speed up the process..Then there is the company's rapidly growing advertising business. The company's namesake website, which is one of the most visited websites worldwide, should help it maintain a robust, rapidly growing ad business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-monster-stocks-own-10-101500105.html

But here's the good news: The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) offers investors a simple way to buy them all, with a splash of diversification..It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and the Magnificent Seven account for over half of the total value of its entire portfolio. Here's how the ETF could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the next 15 years (or less)..The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which invests in the top 70% of the cumulative market capitalization of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index. The CRSP U.S. Total Market Index holds each of the 3,537 stocks listed on American exchanges..The U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index (and by extension, the Vanguard ETF) only holds 69 stocks, which highlights the incredible concentration of wealth in corporate America. To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the entire value of the 3,537 companies listed on American stock exchanges..It isn't entirely surprising considering the Magnificent Seven stocks have a combined market capitalization of $17 trillion, which they have accumulated by dominating various subsegments of the technology industry including cloud computing, semiconductors, e-commerce, social media, and electric vehicles..As a result, the Magnificent Seven stocks alone represent 56.3% of the total value of the Vanguard ETF's portfolio of 69 stocks:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stocks-could-help-085600953.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple,"Amazon's recent stock performance and growth are much better than Apple's.  Apple seems to be stronger financially and has a more attractive valuation than Amazon.  Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed more than 220,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997.","Amazon's recent stock performance and growth are much better than Apple's..Apple seems to be stronger financially and has a more attractive valuation than Amazon..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Two of the largest companies on the planet have also been among the biggest winners for investors over the years. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed more than 220,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) share price has soared more than 59,000% since its IPO in 1980..However, accolades achieved in previous decades don't necessarily translate to future success. Just ask Blockbuster Video or Blackberry..Which is the best stock to buy right now -- Amazon or Apple? Here's how the two stocks stack up against each other..If you're a fan of momentum trading, Amazon will probably be more to your liking than Apple. Sure, shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant tumbled earlier in the year over concerns about President Trump's tariffs. However, Amazon has been on a roll since late April, jumping nearly 30%..What about Apple? The story isn't as positive. Apple stock also fell sharply over tariff worries. Although shares of the iPhone maker have rebounded somewhat, they remain down around 20% year to date..Unsurprisingly, both Amazon and Apple are strong financially. Deciding which company is stronger, though, might depend on the financial metric you prioritize the most..For example, Amazon has a larger cash position. Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as of March 31, 2025, totaled over $94.5 billion. By comparison, Apple reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $48.5 billion, as of March 29, 2025..However, Amazon also has a larger debt load of $157.9 billion, compared to $98.2 billion for Apple. If you focus more on net cash position adjusted for debt, Apple comes out on top..One of the best measures of financial strength, in my opinion, is how much free cash flow a company generates. Apple's free cash flow over the last 12 months totaled $98.5 billion, much higher than Amazon's free cash flow of $25.9 billion..Amazon is the clear leader when it comes to recent growth. In its most recent quarter, the company's revenue increased by 9% year over year and earnings soared 64% year over year. Apple's growth pales in comparison. The consumer-tech giant's revenue and earnings increased by around 5% year over year in its latest quarter..Both Amazon and Apple could have solid growth prospects in the future. Amazon's cloud unit should remain a key growth driver for the company as organizations build and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models in the cloud. The company also continues to expand into new areas, such as healthcare and satellite internet services. Apple is reportedly developing smart glasses, a new product that could potentially ignite sales growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-amazon-084600832.html

It will cap off a spectacular run of success that dates back to 1965 -- though his journey isn't over completely, because he will continue to serve as chairman of Berkshire's board..Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock when Buffett took the helm 60 years ago and held on for that entire time, you'd have been sitting on shares worth an eye-popping $44.7 million at the end of 2024. The same investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index would have grown to just $342,906 over the same period. Part of that growth came from the dozens of businesses that the conglomerate purchased in their entirety over the years, but the rest was driven by the incredible stock-picking of Buffett and his team..Buffett uses a simple strategy, and as a general rule, he tends to avoid buying shares of companies whose businesses he doesn't understand. As a result, he doesn't invest in technology stocks very often, and he certainly doesn't chase hot trends like artificial intelligence (AI)..However, there is one AI stock that could be a great fit in Berkshire's portfolio because it meets most of Buffett's investment criteria, and he has even expressed regret for not investing in it during its early years..Buffett is a value investor who likes to buy good companies when they are trading cheap, but he doesn't shy away from picking up shares of spectacular companies at a fair price..When considering a potential investment, Buffett looks for companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, and strong management teams. He also likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback programs. But time is Buffett's most important weapon because compound growth amplifies his results over the long term -- he has often been quoted as saying his preferred holding period is forever..Buffett oversees numerous wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, including Duracell, Dairy Queen, and GEICO Insurance. But he also helps manage its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, which currently includes holdings in 38 companies and is worth around $278 billion today. As I mentioned earlier, he generally avoids technology stocks like those in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but he has made exceptions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-isnt-081600959.html
2025-06-17 12:03:00,Bear of the Day: PDD Holdings (PDD),"Though Temu parent PDD Holdings has carved out an impressive niche in the global e-commerce landscape, the company faces signficant headwinds, including, tarriffs, a weak Chinese economy, and intense competition.","Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock PDD Holdings (PDD), also known as Pinduoduo, is a multinational e-commerce company that operates in China and globally. PDD, which was based originally in Shanghai, enjoys it’ largest market in China and operates under the Pinduoduo name. Meanwhile, PDD’s US and international businesses operate under the ‘Temu” umbrella. PDD has gained a foothold in several international markets by offering competitive and often cheaper prices than competitors such as JD.com (JD), Alibaba (BABA), and Amazon (AMZN)..In its Chinese market, another key differentiator for PDD Holdings is that it offers a group buying model that allows customers to unlock lower prices by encouraging family and friends also to purchase items. The team purchase model does this through an interactive and social shopping experience. In addition, PDD can often offer lower prices because it removes the middleman and connects users directly with agricultural producers, allowing the company to provide fresh, affordable produce. Beyond its e-commerce platform, PDD has vertically integrated its business with a vast network of sourcing, logistics, and fulfillment capabilities..Last quarter, PDD’s net profit plunged nearly 50%, and the company fell short of Zacks Consensus Estimates by an ugly 37%..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.PDD is suffering amid three major challenges, including:.·       Tariff Turmoil: PDD was one of the most adversely impacted businesses in the tit-for-tat tariff war between the US and China.Though tensions have cooled between the world’s two largest economies, the US still has a tariff on China of around 50%, likely making goods from the Temu website far more expensive for Americans..·       A Weak Chinese Economy: An ongoing housing crisis, rampant unemployment, and sluggish domestic consumption are all factors causing PDD’s Chinese business to suffer..·       Intense Competition: The Chinese e-commerce market is highly competitive. Though PDD missed estimates, JD beat estimates in the recent quarter – an ominous sign..PDD is not only suffering from sluggish demand but also weak profit margins.

However, its revenue growth over the past few years has been modest, while much of its stock gains have come from multiple expansions, as its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been increasing..The company also appears to have fallen behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, with Apple Intelligence features reportedly consistently running into delays. In addition, some high-gross-margin revenue from a revenue-sharing agreement that allows Google to be the exclusive search engine for Safari on Apple devices is at risk after Alphabet lost an antitrust trial where the agreement was at the center of the case. While the company likely wouldn't lose all of this revenue, there is a risk that some of it would go away if it gave users the option to choose their default search engine..Against this background, the upside for Apple may be limited over the next several years, opening the door for other companies to become larger than Apple. Let's look at two companies that could exceed Apple's market cap in the next five years..With a market cap of roughly $2.3 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is well-positioned to overtake Apple in size over the next few years. The company is the market-share leader in two important segments: e-commerce and cloud computing. And while Apple has lagged on the AI front, Amazon has gone all in, incorporating AI throughout its businesses to help make them more efficient and drive growth..Its e-commerce business has settled into being a high single-digit, low double-digit percentage revenue grower. The segment is seeing strong margin expansion and operating leverage, which are powering profitability growth. Its high-gross margin, sponsored-ad business is playing a big part, with revenue climbing 19% year over year last quarter to $13.9 billion..Amazon is also seeing a lot of operational efficiencies. The company now incorporates AI throughout its warehouse and logistics operations to improve efficiencies and lower costs. It is developing AI-powered robots that can perform multiple tasks and even detect damaged items, helping the company save money on labor and costly returns. Meanwhile, it's using AI in its logistics business to help drivers save time and fuel by planning better routes and helping them more easily locate hard-to-find addresses in places like large apartment complexes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-stocks-thatll-worth-074500784.html

He says that you shouldn't buy stocks unless you expect to hold them for a very extended period, and he has followed that approach with the companies he invests in through Berkshire Hathaway. He has held on to many stocks for decades..Considering Buffett's approach, and his impressive track record, Berkshire's portfolio is a great place to get investment ideas. Here are two Buffett stocks worth checking out..Berkshire owned 10 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as of its 13F filing on May 15. Given Amazon's dominance over e-commerce, as well as its cloud services and use of artificial intelligence (AI), it's an excellent stock to buy and hold..Amazon is the top online retailer in the world as measured by revenue, and even though this is an established company, it's still seeing good revenue growth. Net sales were $155.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 9% year-over-year increase. Analysts expect the global e-commerce market to continue growing -- Grand View Research is projecting annual growth of 11.6% until 2030 -- which should mean plenty of growth to come for Amazon..Online sales isn't the only place where Amazon is No. 1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud service provider by market share, with 30% of the global market at the end of 2024..Last but not least, Amazon has been leveraging generative AI technology to improve efficiency for itself and its sellers. It currently has about 1,000 generative AI applications in use, including tools that drastically cut down the time it takes for sellers to list their products..Despite being one of the largest companies in the world, Amazon is still focused on innovation and expansion. I think it's a quality investment right now and will continue to be 10 and 20 years down the road..Visa (NYSE: V) is one of the companies that Buffett has held for more than a decade. He started investing in 2011, and Berkshire now owns 8.3 million shares, good for just over 1% of its stock holdings..As a payment network, Visa has a simple, effective business model. When people pay with their Visa debit or credit cards, Visa collects a fee from the merchant. Credit card fees can be particularly lucrative, as they generally range from 1.1% to 3.15% of the transaction, according to data compiled by Motley Fool Money, a personal finance brand by The Motley Fool.

They are also powerful tools that, when used wisely, can help you save money, manage debt and even earn rewards. Whether you're looking to cut down on interest payments, earn cashback on everyday purchases, rack up air miles for your next holiday, or avoid fees while traveling abroad, there's a credit card tailored to your needs..In this guide, we’ll break down the best options on the market for balance transfers, purchases, cashback, air miles and travel spending. We'll show you how to use these cards to your advantage, ensuring you get the most value while avoiding common mistakes..If you're struggling to keep up with credit card payments, a balance transfer credit card can be a lifesaver. These cards allow you to transfer existing credit card debt onto a new card with a 0% interest rate for a set period, potentially saving you hundreds of pounds in interest..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.However, there are some crucial rules to follow to make the most of these deals:.Always pay the minimum monthly repayment. Missing a payment could result in losing your 0% interest deal, incurring fines, and damaging your credit score..Clear the debt within the interest-free period. To avoid paying interest after the promotional period ends, make sure you can pay off the entire balance within the 0% timeframe..Don’t use the card for new purchases. The 0% deal usually applies only to transferred balances, and using the card for new spending could result in hefty interest charges..Check your credit score. The best deals are often reserved for those with a strong credit rating, so it's worth checking your score before applying..Kate Steere, a credit card expert at personal finance comparison site finder.com, said: “NatWest (NWG.L) is leading the pack this week with 34 months at 0%. However, its transfer fee at 3.49% is slightly higher than that of HSBC (HSBA.L) and Tesco Bank at 3.19%, which are still offering a top-of-market deal of 0% at 33 months..""The longest 0% deals always come with these painful, percentage-based balance transfer fees. So if you’re in the market for a balance transfer and don’t think you’ll need such a long period to clear your card debt, then first consider the longest no-fee deals on the market (Barclaycard (BARC.L) currently offers 14 months with no transfer fee)..""But if you do know you'll need longer to clear your debt, then a balance transfer fee could be worth shouldering. Tesco has a respectable 'Goldilocks' deal, if you'd like something in the middle: a 0.99% transfer fee in return for 18 months at 0%.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-credit-card-deals-093401129.html

When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

The offer arrives shortly after the startup, which launched in 2023, surpassed $500 million in annualized revenue..The company didn’t initiate the conversations, the person said, and may decide not to raise money at this time..“We have not engaged with or spoken with any investors about financing since our Series C,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Truell said in a message to Bloomberg. “We’re not focused on fundraising and have lots to do on building the technology, product, and team. Cursor can be made much more useful, and we’re spending time on that.”.While the startup isn’t in need of cash, given the favorable terms, it could choose to add more capital to its balance sheet. Earlier this month, Anysphere said it raised $900 million at a valuation of $9.9 billion, including the new investment, in a round led by Thrive Capital. Andreessen Horowitz, Accel and DST Global also participated..Following that deal, Silicon Valley investors are eager to put more capital into what they say is the fastest-growing startup of all time in terms of revenue.

Companies like OpenAI, Spotify Technology SA, Major League Baseball and Instacart are all users of Cursor, which analyzes a programmer’s actions and suggests lines of code..The tools make it easier for people without technical expertise to create computer programs, a trend sometimes called vibe coding, as well as making regular software developers more efficient..Earlier this month, Truell told Bloomberg that more than half of Fortune 500 companies use Cursor, and more than 1 million people use the service every day..Still, the startup faces fierce competition, including from GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer.

2025-06-17 12:03:00,Andy Jassy is the perfect Amazon CEO for the looming gen-AI cost-cutting era,The Amazon chief's public memo about AI's impact on the workforce raises numerous questions. But there's one clear takeaway if you've been paying attention to the company.,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told hundreds of thousands of his employees on Tuesday that generative AI is coming for their jobs and that their best bet is to embrace the technology..“Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog..But no matter how geeked Amazon employees get over new AI tools, Jassy also made a point to note that there’s not room on the bus for everybody: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”.As I read this note—and I recommend reading the whole thing—some questions quickly came to mind. Are some parts of Amazon’s vast organization highly resistant to the new technology and perhaps in need of a public nudge (or kick in the butt), in Jassy’s view? Seems likely. Is the public memo a wink-wink to Wall Street that the company’s heavy AI investments will eventually pay off by delivering significant cost reductions? I suppose..Is the note meant to provide some glossy AI cover for imminent or future mass layoffs that may have nothing, or just something, to do with AI actually eating some corporate tasks? I guess that’s possible too, though I find it less likely..And are the parts of the essay where Jassy methodically outlines the various ways Amazon already uses gen AI—a ritutal he has performed publicly on more than one occasion this year—designed to thrust Amazon into AI-dominated news cycles that often feature many other companies not named Amazon? Perhaps..No matter the exact goal or impetus, and Amazon isn’t saying what exactly the impetus for this public memo was, Jassy seems like the right leader for the current job—especially on the cost-cutting, or, as he referred to it in his annual shareholder letter in April, the “cost avoidance and productivity” bucket of gen-AI impact..I don’t mean to discount Jassy’s ability to lead on the innovation front. He transformed and led Amazon Web Services, after all, from its infancy into the behemoth cloud provider it is today..But ever since taking over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy has also become the company’s chief cost-cutter and has appeared comfortable in the role..He has overseen the largest corporate layoffs in company history in recent years, joining other Big Tech companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Salesforce, which all slashed headcounts after overhiring in the pandemic.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/andy-jassy-perfect-amazon-ceo-224456799.html

Think for a moment on how far we’ve come."".The GENIUS Act, which stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins,” sets a framework for how US companies can issue and manage dollar-backed stablecoins for payments..It bans members of Congress and their families from earning profits from stablecoins but not President Trump and his family, an omission that has irked some Democrats and slowed progress on the legislation this spring..Read more: Trump has called for a strategic bitcoin reserve. How it would work..Trump is deepening his own financial involvement in stablecoins as the legislation advances.

From this past weekend’s Crypto Investor Network update:.Stablecoins offer these giants a compelling reason to jump into crypto: lower transaction fees and faster settlements..Every year, Amazon and Walmart fork over billions to card networks in interchange fees. By launching or accepting stablecoins — especially dollar-backed ones — they can bypass the Visa/Mastercard mafia, cut costs, and settle instantly, including cross-border..This isn’t just a payments innovation. It’s an economic incentive. It’s capitalist gravity pulling big business toward crypto rails..Building on Luke’s point, Walmart and Amazon together are estimated to spend around $14 billion annually on card‑processing fees. Just a 1% cutback in those payments via stablecoins could translate into roughly $1 billion in profit before interest and taxes..Meanwhile, faster settlement times – instant, instead of the typical days – would improve cash flow, especially across international supplier chains..If these projects gain traction, stablecoins could turn Walmart and Amazon into quasi‑financial hubs. They could provide the framework for launching new service ecosystems, locking in customer loyalty, and boosting margins..Basically, these retail giants could undercut existing payment ecosystems while retaining control of the user experience..This is a major threat to traditional credit-card networks. Plus, banks and payment processors may face pricing pressure as retail giants shift to in‑house payment rails.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-amazon-could-upend-banking-214055553.html

Does that suggest US consumers are tapped out or an expected outcome after tariff fears drove panic spending? Joining me now we've got Deborah Weinswig, who is the Coresight Research founder and CEO. Still with me here as well, we've got Peter Tchir of Academy Securities. Deborah, good to see you back here with us this morning. First, just want to get your read in on the retail sales data that came across and where ultimately this kind of mirrors with the anticipations going into the report, given what we know about consumers and the propensity to spend, given some of the uncertainty we've been waiting through. .Well, first, thanks for having me. And it's really interesting. We've been doing weekly surveys of the consumer since January of 2020. And the data literally, I haven't even published it yet. So, uh, in the 100,000 plus household income, we saw a 6.3% increase in terms of how they feel since the beginning of the year. But this is the clencher, uh, the greatest negative number in kind of middle income, 50,000 and 100,000, a 12.7% drop. And then under 50,000, 5.4% drop. So really that that middle class is, I would say, even if they're they're not necessarily feeling it in their wallets yet, they are definitely reigning it in on spending. .How how, Peter, do we get to a point where some of this data doesn't scream stagflation? .Well, you know, it's been amazing, and I'm, it's too early maybe to discount the retailer, because I think we've run out of adjectives to describe, you know, how the consumer keeps coming back. But I do think it's really interesting. I guess makes the point that, you know, this is the middle class. And I think that follows back up to what we were just discussing. Yeah. People have to be a little bit cautious. I don't know how student loan payments, you know, being reported now come back into this. So I feel everyone's fairly susceptible, and whether it's hit you or not, I think everyone's behaving a little bit, you know, more cautiously. So we need to get that going, or I think we do see the retail pullback. I don't know where buy now pay later stands in some of this again. So some of these things don't show up in the credit metrics. I think the consumer's fairly stretched. And if I'm right about the jobs number, um, you know, one of my big points has been that the jobs have been overstated. When I look at the birth death model, that gets a bit wonky. But separately, I look at law school applications, MBA applications. They're both skyrocketing. That's, I think, what people do when they don't find a good job as they're graduating. They're like, ""Uh, might as well apply to law school."" So I think the economy is much weaker, and maybe this is the first sign that it's going to hit the consumption. .So, Deborah, as you were talking about kind of that bifurcation that we're seeing among income classes, I I wonder as well, where you anticipate the re on across the retail environment, specific names will bear the most impact, either to the upside or the downside. We got about 45 seconds. .So I think it's interesting, right? We're seeing Amazon extend Prime Day. We're seeing kind of Walmart lean into more alternative revenue streams. I I still worry a lot about Target, uh, and some of the dollar stores, because Walmart is now capturing that 100,000 household income plus. Concerned about the uh, department stores, and we are seeing strength in luxury and some of these direct to consumer luxury brands that are uh, new and kind of like only on Tik Tok. But that's been a really interesting area of growth as well. .Yeah, they've popped up in my feed, uh, pretty much everywhere here. So it's working, whatever they're doing, and it's got me to buy a couple times. I've bit the bait. Deborah, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. Good to see you. .Thanks as always. Take care. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/retail-sales-consumer-data-says-160139241.html

Are other cloud players seeing momentum?","The big banks will really kick the Q2 earnings cycle into a higher gear in a few weeks, but the reality is that earnings season is never ‘over’. We’ve heard from several companies over recent weeks, whose results we’ll include as part of the broader Q2 tally..Among the group that have already reported, Oracle ORCL saw a notably strong reaction thanks to its robust results, with shares seeing a strong move higher post-earnings. Up nearly 30% YTD, shares are now outperforming the S&P 500 following the print..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Let’s take a closer look at the release and a few other major cloud players, such as Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN..Concerning headline expectations in the release, sales of $15.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.70 both cleared our consensus expectations, reflecting growth rates of 11% and 4.3%, respectively. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Notably, its remaining performance obligations (RPOs) were up a strong 41% year-over-year, a reflection of the red-hot demand the company has been witnessing..CEO Safra Catz said –. “We expect our total cloud growth rate—applications plus infrastructure—will increase from 24% in FY25 to over 40% in FY26. Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26. And RPO is likely to grow more than 100% in FY26. Oracle is well on its way to being not only the world’s largest cloud application company — but also one of the world’s largest cloud infrastructure companies.”.The red-hot demand is also showing up in analysts’ current year sales expectations, which have moved considerably higher following the release. As we can see, sales expectations were already trending higher for some time, with the recent commentary cementing the strong outlook..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Microsoft shares have been strong in 2025 so far, up 14% compared to the S&P 500’s 2% gain.

NBIS is an upcoming player in the AI-infrastructure market, while Amazon AMZN is an established tech behemoth. NBIS is a GPU-focused cloud platform, while Amazon dominates the AI cloud space through Amazon Web Services or AWS, the world’s leading cloud provider, integrating AI capabilities at scale..Per an IDC report, spending on AI infrastructure is expected to top $200 billion by 2028. This uptrend in spending benefits both Amazon and Nebius, but not equally. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in the AI infrastructure space, which stock stands out?.Let’s break down how each company is performing and which one looks like the better investment right now..Amsterdam-based Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company.  NBIS also builds full-stack infrastructure for AI, like large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms, and tools and services for developers. Collaboration with Saturn Cloud and deeper NVIDIA integration boosts bodes well..NBIS is doubling down on AI infrastructure with an ambitious $2 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, up from its earlier guidance of $1.5 billion. NBIS stated that the increase was primarily due to some planned fourth-quarter spending shifting into the early first quarter. Nebius is focusing on building a global footprint, with capacity in the United States, Europe and the Middle East amid accelerating demand for its AI-infrastructure services. It added three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel, in the last reported quarter. In June 2025, NBIS announced private placement of $1 billion in convertible notes to capitalize on the AI-infrastructure boom and drive-up revenue opportunities in 2026..It recently announced the general availability of NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip capacity for its customers in Europe. NBIS plans to build a data-center infrastructure pipeline that can offer scalability to more than 1 gigawatt (“GW”) of capacity. With 1 GW of power, NBIS expects significantly higher revenues beyond its current guidance..To gain a larger share of the AI cloud compute market, NBIS is focusing on technical enhancements that increase reliability and reduce downtime to boost customer retention. In the first quarter, Nebius significantly upgraded its AI cloud infrastructure through improvements to its Slurm-based cluster and its object storage capabilities. The upgraded storage system ensures that big data sets can be easily accessed and saved quickly during model training, directly lowering time-to-result for end users. NBIS successfully graduated multiple platform services like MLflow and JupyterLab Notebook from beta to general availability. Nebius expanded integrations with external AI platforms like Metaflow, D Stack and SkyPilot, enabling customers to migrate tools with nominal friction.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nbis-vs-amzn-ai-infra-134400995.html

The post Amazon uses 21 Air for new dedicated cargo service to Colombia appeared first on FreightWaves.,"Amazon’s private cargo airline, created to expedite online deliveries, has launched its first dedicated South American route with the help of two other carriers: 21 Air, a small U.S. freight operator, and Avianca, a major Latin American airline with a strong cargo arm..Amazon announced earlier this month the signing of Avianca Cargo as a customer for its new service that offers unused freighter space to third-party shippers. Avianca is booking shipments on Amazon Air backhaul flights from Bogotá, Colombia, to Miami that otherwise would be empty..The news release was issued by Amazon Air Cargo, the business unit that sells wholesale air cargo service to freight forwarders and other logistics operators, to highlight it is open for business to shippers in Colombia and the region..The announcement didn’t focus on the fact that in-house airline Amazon Air, which has an extensive transport network in the United States and more limited footprints in Europe and India, is now operating internationally, bringing to Colombia inbound parcels filled with goods ordered on its marketplace. The daily flights, which began on April 8 utilizing a Boeing 767-300 converted freighter, mark the first time Amazon Air has conducted cross-border flights, excluding activity in close-knit Europe..Amazon Air relies on partner airlines because it isn’t certified to fly commercial aircraft and doesn’t have its own pilots. It has a fleet of nearly 100 converted freighters, including 10 Airbus A330-300s and Boeing 737-800 narrowbody aircraft..FreightWaves identified 21 Air as the carrier operating the Miami-Bogota route on Amazon Air’s behalf, based on flight data from AirNav Radar. 21 Air, which began flying for Amazon in November, is based at Miami International Airport. It has a fleet of 16 Boeing 767s, six of which were supplied by Amazon. Amazon spokeswoman Gabriela Castillo confirmed that 21 Air is the underlying carrier for the Bogota service..21 Air also operates in Amazon’s traditional parcel network between San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami and Amazon’s superhub at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport in Ohio..Avianca Cargo, which operates six Airbus A330-200 freighter aircraft in addition to managing shipments carried by the airline’s passenger fleet, said the northbound Amazon flights will be used to transport flowers and other products to the U.S. market. Miami is the largest U.S. gateway for fresh flowers..Amazon has been offering international shipping to Colombia since 2019. Prior to the new dedicated air cargo service it relied on ocean freight or other commercial airlines to move products to fulfillment warehouses in the country.

Here’s everything you need to know about the summer’s biggest shopping event..Back on July 15, 2015, Amazon held its first Amazon Prime Day. The now-annual event sees millions of items on Amazon go on sale for Prime members. It’s a way to reward them for subscribing to Amazon’s subscription delivery service. The event also acts as a promotion for the service and an incentive to get other Amazon shoppers to subscribe..The inaugural 2015 Amazon Prime Day was true to its name—the event lasted just one day. It also lasted just one day when it was held the following year in 2016. But from 2017 until last year, Amazon extended Amazon Prime Day into a two-day sales event..So I know what you’re thinking: This year Amazon has stretched Amazon Prime “Day” to three days, right? Wrong. Amazon has now announced that Amazon Prime “Day” is now a four-day event. Yep, in Amazon’s world, one day now equals 96 hours..From a math perspective, at this point it would just make more sense for Amazon to round up the “Amazon Prime Day” moniker to “Amazon Prime Week” instead of keeping the name rounded down..Amazon Prime Day 2025 will kick off in the second week of July. The four-day event begins at 12:01 a.m. PDT on Tuesday, July 8, and runs until Friday, July 11..“With the summer shopping event returning, for the first time for four days, Prime members have double the time to shop millions of deals with savings on pantry staples and snacks for summer gatherings to home-improvement must-haves, back-to-school supplies, health and personal care finds, family-favorite toys, best-selling books, pet essentials, and even premium and luxury splurges,” Amazon said in its announcement..Amazon will be holding Prime Day in most of the countries in which it operates.

That follows a nearly 2% decline on Monday, a day that saw the broader Nasdaq 100 Index rally 1.4%..Last week’s $116 billion rally has shifted the focus to Oracle’s execution, according to Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. Its growth opportunity from AI reminds Morgan of Microsoft Corp.’s push into cloud computing in the last decade or even Nvidia Corp.’s data center business in 2023..“That could end up being too optimistic, but I think Oracle is in its teenager phase, not yet mature,” Morgan said. “We could maybe look back on this quarter as the moment we all realized how much more there is to come.”.Oracle is best known for its database software but has been investing aggressively in its cloud-computing business. That spending appears to be paying off as the company predicted “dramatically higher” revenue growth for its upcoming fiscal year amid strong demand for AI-related services..Analysts expect that growth rate to be about 16%, up from 8.4% in fiscal 2025, which ended last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income, meanwhile, is expected to rise 15% in fiscal 2026, and expansion in both metrics is projected to accelerate in fiscal 2027..While Oracle’s market share within cloud computing remains below that of bigger players like Amazon.com Inc.

The business is strong on many fronts, too. Sales grew 10% in the first quarter, excluding currency fluctuations, including a 17% jump in revenue from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud services platform..Trailing-12-month operating income was over 50% higher year over year as of the first quarter. By those metrics and more, it would seem Amazon's business is firing on all cylinders..Yet the stock is down about 3% year to date as of this writing. Investors might want to take advantage of that since there are several reasons the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will help Amazon extend its growth businesses for years to come..Adjacent to its online retail empire, Amazon has Prime and other subscription services and related advertising on the platform. Its studios add content to the Prime streaming service. Its logistics segment has become a vast streamlined delivery operation, and AWS is a leading provider of on-demand cloud computing platforms. It has also started testing its Zoox self-driving service in six locations..The company says its new Amazon Nova foundation model is growing rapidly, too. Nova can process text, images, and videos as prompts, helping customers use generative AI applications in various ways to make their own businesses more efficient and profitable..The company also has its own Trainium2 advanced AI accelerator chips and architecture that make it easier for AWS customers to train models. Amazon also just launched its first Project Kuiper satellites that it hopes will provide broadband access to hundreds of millions without access today..Amazon isn't just generating revenue and profit from AI. It's using it to streamline the company itself. The table below shows how revenue per employee has been steadily increasing in recent years..Year.$414.$375.$326.$323.$368.Data source: YCharts.

The stock has enormous potential to deliver great returns for investors, but investors need to be aware of the near-term risk.  Can buying UPS stock set you up for life?","UPS' strategy of shifting revenue to higher-margin deliveries and optimizing its network can add significant value for investors..Weakening end markets have created near-term pressure on its earnngs outlook for 2025..The stock has enormous potential to deliver great returns for investors, but investors need to be aware of the near-term risk..10 stocks we like better than United Parcel Service ›.UPS (NYSE: UPS) is one of the most fascinating investment propositions in the marketplace right now. Considering the long term, there is significant potential for substantial long-term appreciation. However, in the near term, there is potential for some disappointment, and there are real questions over the sustainability of its dividend. Here's the lowdown..At the risk of losing half of you upfront, I'm going to cut to the chase. UPS is a stock that could generate great returns for investors, but be prepared for some potential near-term turbulence, and don't buy this stock if you are buying it mainly for its dividend..I'll break this argument down into its parts so that readers can form their own opinions. Let's start with the long-term bullish case. It rests on the idea that management is fundamentally doing the right things for the business over the long term by migrating its delivery volumes toward higher-margin deliveries. In addition, it's taking the right measures to boost productivity through technology investments in its so-called ""network of the future."".At the heart of management's approach is a determination to optimize the profitability of its network rather than chasing volume growth and trying to generate earnings growth through scale. There are a few key parts:.Focus on growing deliveries in targeted end markets where UPS is already established, such as small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and the healthcare sector..The decision, announced in January, to reduce Amazon.com deliveries by 50% by the second half of 2026 will result in fewer low- or negative-margin deliveries. Amazon deliveries can be costly to deliver, as they often contain bulky items and go to multiple, disparate, and hard-to-reach residential addresses..Investments in automation and smart facilities will create more productive facilities, enabling the consolidation of several less productive facilities..The key aspect of these plans is that they build on initiatives that UPS is already undertaking and excelling in..Let's take a look at the shift in delivery volume and revenue. SMBs accounted for 27% of UPS' U.S. delivery volumes in 2021, and by the first quarter of 2025, that figure had increased to 31.2%. Management has a long-term aspiration to get to 40% , and it will likely increase given the reduction in Amazon volume. Management expects it to be 35% of U.S. volume in 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buying-ups-today-set-112200495.html

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) looks like one of the most exciting stocks to own over the next several decades.  Right now, Amazon sits at the center of the ongoing AI revolution.","Amazon currently generates most of its sales from e-commerce..But there's another division that should grow significantly faster with higher profits..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) looks like one of the most exciting stocks to own over the next several decades. But don't be fooled: This excitement has nothing to do with the company's e-commerce business that currently contributes most of its revenue..Instead, there's another business segment that most investors aren't familiar with. This division should grow by leaps and bounds for years to come thanks to a massive rise in artificial intelligence spending..Right now, Amazon sits at the center of the ongoing AI revolution. It implemented AI solutions throughout much of its e-commerce division. But it really is Amazon Web Services -- commonly referred to simply as AWS -- that is the true winner..AWS is essentially a global cloud infrastructure provider. When an AI developer wants to train a model, for instance, they rarely build out their own infrastructure. It would be far too inefficient when it comes to cost and lead times for each developer or AI business to construct independent facilities. Instead, they almost always rent from a cloud infrastructure provider like AWS. This lets them scale up their needs dynamically at the press of a button, executing commands on a distributed global computer rather than a local device..Thanks to early investment, AWS is now the largest cloud infrastructure business in the world. The division has a roughly 30% global market share, nearly as much as the next two competitors (Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud) combined. This scale gives AWS several major advantages..First, AWS has greater global reach when it comes to data center locations. This geographic proximity can provide developers with lower latency times as well as more options for delivering data to end users around the world. Second, scale allows AWS to either charge less for its services or generate higher operating margins. In a business where scale matters a lot for profitability -- especially for fairly commoditized cloud services -- AWS has an enviable lead..Finally, AWS' scale likely gives it greater bargaining power when it comes to suppliers. For example, when Nvidia announced its new Blackwell chip architecture, a 12-month waitlist quickly formed. Amazon's scale likely gives it a small advantage here in sourcing highly coveted chips like this, granting it an ability to better meet user demand for next-gen performance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-buying-amazon-stock-today-103000993.html

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter. .Disney Advertising and Amazon Ads today (June 17) integrated Disney's Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX) and Amazon Demand-side Platform (DSP), per details shared with Marketing Dive. The collaboration allows advertisers to leverage insights from both companies as they access the media giant’s premium inventory across platforms..“By building a direct path connecting Amazon's commerce insights to the full scale of Disney's streaming ecosystem, we're enabling greater accessibility to inventory and audience signals that translate into meaningful results for advertisers leveraging Amazon DSP,” said Matt Barnes, vice president of programmatic sales at Disney Advertising, in a statement..Along with supporting targeting, transparency and efficiency, the partnership will also allow advertisers to create campaigns that bring together Disney’s audience data and a wealth of insights from Amazon Ads through a collaboration between Amazon Publisher Cloud (APC) and Disney Compass, the media giant’s data collaboration platform launched in January..In an example provided in a press release, a pet food brand could reach an audience of Disney viewers who have shown interest in pet products on Amazon, notching the higher reach and lowers costs that streaming TV advertisers have seen when using publisher-enriched deals on APC, an offering built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Clean Rooms technology..“By connecting Disney's premium content with Amazon's deep consumer understanding, we're creating advertising that works better for everyone—brands reach the right audiences, publishers maximize their inventory value and viewers see more relevant ads,” said Kelly MacLean, vice president of Amazon DSP at Amazon Ads, in a statement..Implementation will begin with select advertisers in the coming months before being opened to all Amazon DSP advertisers in the third quarter of 2025. The partnership also promises audience targeting and curated packages through Disney’s other ad solutions, such as Disney’s Magic Words offering (a contextual solution that is also at the heart of a just-announced partnership between Omnicom and Disney around live sports)..The news, timed to this week’s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, comes as Disney Compass crosses the five-month anniversary since its debut at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year. The data collaboration and measurement platform gives advertisers visibility into Disney’s first-party data, serves as an entry point for agency integrations and delivers interoperability with third-party data and measurement collaborators — all functions that are increasingly in-demand for data-obsessed advertisers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-disney-compass-seeks-true-101900231.html

Quantum computing is a hot topic in the market, and if it proves to be a viable technology over the next decade, it can really shake up the computing industry.","Amazon and Alphabet are developing internal quantum computing chips..IonQ has sold some of its products to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud..10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›.Quantum computing is a hot topic in the market, and if it proves to be a viable technology over the next decade, it can really shake up the computing industry. However, pinpointing the winner of the quantum computing race is far from certain. No company has set itself apart from another as the go-to solution for quantum computing, so the field is wide open..Investing in quantum computing start-ups right now is akin to biotech investing -- either a company will succeed or it will fail. This all-or-nothing investment approach may suit some investors, but I'm not a huge fan of it. Instead, I'd rather pick some of the big tech companies competing in this race and have a backup plan should quantum computing not work out. From that standpoint, I like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). In the start-up realm, I'm a huge fan of IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), although that company is more of a long shot compared to the other two..I think it's key to take a balanced approach in quantum computing, and taking a position in this trio exposes investors to the right amount of risk..Alphabet kicked off the latest quantum computing hype cycle in December 2024 when it announced its Willow chip had completed a computing task in five minutes that would take the most powerful supercomputer 10 septillion years (a 10 with 25 trailing zeros) to perform. Now, this test was rigged in Willow's favor because it tackled a problem that is only solvable using quantum computers, but there are many problems like that in the world, such as logistics networks and weather patterns. There are also massive implications with AI, and quantum computing could be the technology that unlocks AI's maximum potential..Amazon is also working on its own chip, Ocelot. These two companies are heavily pursuing quantum computing because they have already built significant infrastructure to support cloud computing. Cloud computing involves moving workloads online to a cloud computing server, which clients rent from providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. Having rentable quantum computing hardware is key, as they don't want to be caught in the same position as traditional computing..The most popular workhorse computing hardware used in cloud computing is the graphics processing unit (GPU), made by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). GPUs have become popular devices to run workloads on, and Nvidia has captured a massive chunk of the data center computing market share. As a result, AWS and Google Cloud must continue buying expensive hardware from Nvidia. If they can develop their own quantum computing solutions for the next wave of computing innovation, they won't be subject to a supplier's ecosystem, allowing them to make more money.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-quantum-computing-stocks-093000044.html

A survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed 61.9% of respondents were bearish during the week ended April 3, which means they expected the market to decline over the next six months..Bearish sentiment has only topped 60% in eight weekly surveys since 1987. In this case, the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration were responsible for the widespread pessimism, but all previous incidents have something in common: Stocks were always much higher a year later..In fact, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 27% in the 12 months after bearish sentiment readings above 60%. That may sound counterintuitive, but extreme pessimism is typically a contrarian signal because most situations are less dire than they first appear. In this scenario, the S&P 500 closed at 5,397 on April 3. If its performance matches the historical average, the index will advanced 27% to 6,854 by next April..That implies 13% upside from its current level of 6,040. Of course, past results are never a guarantee of future performance, but investors can still lean into historical trends provided they maintain a long-term mindset. Here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) are smart investments today..Amazon runs the largest e-commerce marketplace outside of China, and its market share in the United States is forecast to top 40% this year. It is the largest retail advertising company in the world with nearly 40% market share, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud with 29% market share in infrastructure and platform services..Amazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate revenue and improve efficiency across its businesses. CEO Andy Jassy says the company is building 1,000 generative AI applications to streamline retail workflows, including tools for coding, customer service, inventory management, and last-mile delivery.

However, Oracle is starting to make some noise in the segment and is putting up stats that suggest it is now the fastest grower in the space..Let's delve into Oracle's fiscal Q4 results to see how cloud computing is powering its results and what it means for investors moving forward..While Oracle saw its cloud infrastructure (OCI) revenue soar 52% year over year in its fiscal 2025 Q4 to $3 billion, what got investors excited was the company's forecast that its cloud infrastructure revenue would soar by more than 70% in fiscal 2026. Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison boasted that the company will ""build and operate more cloud infrastructure data centers than all of [its] cloud infrastructure competitors combined."".The company pointed to its strong remaining performance obligations (RPO) as a reason for the confidence in its growth outlook, noting that most of these contracts are non-cancellable. In the quarter, RPO jumped 41% to a whopping $138 billion. It said cloud RPO climbed 56% and is now nearly 80% of its total RPO. More importantly, it is looking for about a third of the RPO to be recognized as revenue over the next year..Oracle said that demand for its OCI services continues to ""dramatically"" outpace supply, with consumption revenue soaring 62% year over year. As such, it plans to increase its capital expenditures (capex) to more than $25 billion in fiscal 2026 to help meet increasing demand. It said most of this spending will be on revenue-generating equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings..The company also highlighted the strength of its cloud database services, which saw revenue climb 31% year over year, and its autonomous database, which saw consumption revenue surge 47%. It said that its database service being accessible across multiple cloud providers gives it a competitive advantage in the market..For its fiscal 2025 Q4 ended May 31, Oracle's overall revenue rose 11% year over year to $15.9 billion, which handily topped the $15.6 billion analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG. Cloud revenue increased 27% year over year to $6.7 billion. Within the cloud segment, cloud infrastructure revenue surged 52% to $3 billion, as mentioned above, while cloud application revenue increased 12% to $3.7 billion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-pops-company-shows-080000947.html

Berkshire Hathway has delivered a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over 59 years, while the benchmark has registered a 10% gain over that time period. This isn't thanks to investing in the latest technologies or hot trends but rather to choosing a variety of quality companies in often slower-moving industries, such as consumer goods or financial services..But this doesn't mean you can't apply Buffett's techniques and investing principles to an area he wouldn't necessarily dive into today, such as artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, it's a fantastic idea to consider AI stocks that fit Buffett's playbook, as we know that elements this top investor looks for often lead to investing success..Now the ironic thing about the following two stocks is they actually are ones Buffett owns. But it's key to point out he didn't buy them as AI investments -- he picked up shares of each well before the AI boom -- and I wouldn't expect Buffett to scoop up any stock as an AI bet just yet. But if the billionaire were to change his mind and start shopping for AI players, he probably would add to his holdings of the following two companies..Several years ago, before Buffett picked up Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares, the investing giant said he regretted passing on the stock earlier on. He said he hadn't imagined it was possible to build such an e-commerce empire. Shortly after making those comments, in 2019, one of Buffett's managers added Amazon shares to the portfolio, and the rest is history..Buffett may have bought Amazon for its leading e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses, and today these strong businesses continue to make Amazon a great buy. But on top of this, Amazon is also winning in AI: The company has applied AI tools to its operations to gain in efficiency, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells AI products and services to AI customers..Why is Amazon a Buffett-style buy? This is thanks to the company's solid moat, or competitive advantage, and it takes the form of AWS' leadership. It's easy and logical for current customers to turn to AWS for their AI needs. Considering that AWS is the world's No. 1 cloud-services provider, this means many potential AI customers are ready and waiting. Amazon's e-commerce business also has a strong moat.

2025-06-17 12:03:00,"Amazon (AMZN): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q1 Earnings?","Over the past six months, Amazon’s shares (currently trading at $213.64) have posted a disappointing 7.6% loss while the S&P 500 was flat. This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.","Over the past six months, Amazon’s shares (currently trading at $213.64) have posted a disappointing 7.6% loss while the S&P 500 was flat. This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation..Is there a buying opportunity in Amazon, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? See what our analysts have to say in our full research report, it’s free..Even with the cheaper entry price, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with AMZN and a stock we'd rather own..Amazon may be growing, but was its incremental revenue profitable? This is a fundamental question for investors because its e-commerce business caps its gross margin, which averaged 45.2% over the last five years and lagged its pure-play tech peers..Adding further uncertainty is that Amazon sacrifices profits today for further dominance down the line by investing in diverse areas such as logistics, developer talent, and new markets. This makes the range of outcomes wide but also provides a buying opportunity for bulls with a differentiated view. Ultimately, the company’s long-term margin structure will depend on its pricing power, operating leverage, and mix of business lines..Amazon was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating of 6.8% was weak for a consumer internet business. This is partly structural – rather than developing business software with few maintenance costs, Amazon sells physical goods online where it must acquire and hold physical inventory..If you’ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills or invest for the future..Amazon has shown poor cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 3%, lousy for a consumer internet business..ROIC, or return on invested capital, is a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity)..We like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company’s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Amazon’s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. This is because it’s investing aggressively to capture multiple opportunities in its core markets as well as new ones like healthcare. Given the long-term nature of ROICs, only time will tell if its recent bets bear fruit.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-buy-sell-hold-040324978.html
