Cox data shows that in March, the industry's supply stood at 92 days. In June, that figure fell to 70, with some automakers like Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC) having around half that amount..""The supply this year has been falling dramatically since March as the tariff-induced buying surge drew down available inventories,"" Chesbrough said..Read more: 6 steps to find cheap car insurance in 2025.Cox division Kelly Blue Book reports the average selling price of a new vehicle crept up to $48,799 in May, up from the month before but below the $50K mark seen in the height of the pandemic..As prices are poised to rise, sales may soon drop accordingly..May's sales pace fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.6 million, Chesbrough said, with June slumping even further to 15.3 million, with more declines to follow..""The impact of tariffs have not been felt, and that will change in the 2nd half of this year,"" Chesbrough said..Chesbrough said the Cox team predicts that if tariffs remain in place, sales will fall around 1% to 2% to 15.7 million for the year, down from 15.9 million last year..The pain from falling sales won't hit all automakers uniformly.

By producing batteries large enough to be installed anywhere that capture enough solar and wind power to charge vehicles..The South Korean battery maker, the largest in the country, completed expansion of its Holland, Michigan, facility this month. The plant, operational since 2012, produces automotive vehicle batteries for partners including General Motors, Honda and Hyundai Motors..But the decision to use an over $1.4 billion investment to expand in a new direction ― manufacturing batteries for storage systems in addition to those for automotive use ― came two years ago, said Jaehong Park, CEO of LG Energy Vertech Inc., the company's energy storage branch, told media on June 24..“There were multiple drivers at the time. We found that the EV demand was down,” Park said. “Plus, there was always concern whether we can have enough engineering resources, technicians, in the facility.”.Adding production of batteries for energy storage applications at its plant not only offers two revenue sources for battery technology ― making and charging batteries that power vehicles ― but it insulates the company from future headwinds at a critical time and demonstrates the resilience of battery production, according to North American President Bob Lee..“Traditionally, large scale energy storage is not always easy. We depended on hills with a lake for hydro applications or large spaces for compressed air,” he said. “Those are things you can't put anywhere. We have a solution: We can provide energy storage in any location where the energy is being used.”.Demand for energy storage systems, or ESS batteries, is only increasing, and the flexibility when installing them is what makes the business model so durable, Lee said. Not only can ESS batteries charge vehicles through energy captured from so-called clean energy sources, but it can offset some strain from artificial intelligence data centers..Cell production is up now and can finish 30% of the packing of cells in Holland, the company said. By August, LG Energy Solutions plans to supplement cell packing at a retrofitted plant in the Chicago suburb of Madison, Illinois..Once fully operational, the company plans to produce close to three times as many energy storage batteries as electric vehicle batteries..More: Bill Ford says loss of federal funding could 'imperil' Marshall battery factory",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expanded-lg-plant-holland-could-161111993.html,no risk

GM's Cruise shut its robotaxis operations after one of its cars struck a pedestrian in San Francisco in 2023..Tesla's sales have been sagging as the demand for EVs slows and CEO Elon Musk's politics fueled boycotts and demonstrations worldwide.

The report delves into the strategic implications of adopting green materials, analyzing their environmental impact reductions and comparing OEM approaches. The report also explores the regulatory landscape and future trends, providing a roadmap for sustainable material adoption in the future.Traditional automotive materials, such as steel, aluminum, and plastics derived from fossil fuels, pose significant environmental challenges:.High Carbon Footprint: These materials' extraction, processing, and manufacturing contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions..Resource Depletion: Reliance on finite resources like fossil fuels and metal ores raises concerns about resource depletion and supply chain vulnerability..Pollution and Waste: Manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal generate pollution and contribute to landfill waste..As an alternative to traditional materials, OEMs are increasingly experimenting with green and sustainable materials such as recycled plastics, recycled PET bottles, recycled metals, natural fibers, plant-based composites, bioplastics, and organic wastes from plants, trees, and consumers in different automotive applications within a car to offer lightweight and sustainable benefits. Recycled plastics and metals are the most adopted in the automotive industry. It provides a compelling combination of cost-effectiveness, reduced carbon emission benefits, and circular economy advantages compared with other green materials, making it the leading choice among OEMs.However, challenges persist with the full-scale implementation of these materials in vehicles. Implementing green and environmentally sustainable materials involves huge investments, which especially burdens small- and medium-scale automotive OEMs. Recovery and recycling processes are not compelling enough to obtain high-quality recycled products at a cost that can compete with primary raw material prices. Though bio-based materials are environmentally friendly, they are not entirely sustainable owing to inefficient sourcing methods (e.g., deforestation of trees), low biodegradability potential in some materials, and higher production costs.The base year of the report is 2024. It comprehensively analyzes each material and discusses different initiatives in the automotive ecosystem, highlighting the sustainability potential of materials, trend analysis, and strategic developments to provide a comprehensive understanding of the industry's trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/green-materials-cars-strategic-analysis-080700702.html,1.

The firm estimates that automakers will pass on 80% of the $30 billion tariff cost, adding about $1,760 per car, according to Bloomberg..“These tariffs bring a big wall of cost,” said Mark Wakefield, AlixPartners’ global auto lead. “We see consumers taking the majority of the hit.”.General Motors and Ford have already projected tariff-related hits of $5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and plan to offset some of it through price hikes. Wakefield warned this will result in around 1 million fewer cars sold in the U.S. over the next three years. Still, AlixPartners sees a rebound, projecting U.S. auto sales to hit 17 million by 2030..Bloomberg reports that while the 25% tariff is steep now, the firm expects it to ease as trade deals evolve, predicting a drop to 7.5% for assembled cars and 5% for parts. “This tariff wall is not likely to last forever,” Wakefield noted..What may have longer-lasting consequences, however, is the Trump administration’s rollback of EV incentives, including the $7,500 consumer tax credit. Without that support, Americans are expected to “follow their pocketbook,” Wakefield said, and stick with gas-powered cars..As a result, AlixPartners slashed its EV forecast for 2030. They now see battery electrics making up just 17% of U.S. car sales—down from an earlier prediction of 31%. Internal combustion engines, previously expected to fall to one-third of sales, are now projected to hold at 50%. Traditional hybrids are forecast to reach 27%, while plug-in hybrids will make up only 6%..Wakefield warned that these policy shifts could seriously undercut U.S. automakers in the global EV race, potentially making them reliant on Chinese platforms and technology..“It makes it much more likely that they end up licensing or joint venturing or otherwise using platforms and EV technologies from China,” he said..And while American automakers might still dominate one segment, Wakefield had a biting prediction: “They’ll have the world’s best V8 engines by 2028. They’ll probably also have the world’s only V8 engines by 2028.”.By Zerohedge.com.More Top Reads From Oilprice.com.Alberta Exceeded Its Flaring Limit for Years Before Scrapping It.Europe Struggles To Find Diplomatic Role in Israel-Iran Conflict.Russia Considers AI Data Centers as Collapsing Gas Sales Create Glut.Read this article on OilPrice.com",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-tariffs-add-2-000-200000473.html,Market Risk   Operational Risk   Strategic Risk   Regulatory Risk

It’s brought together industry lobbies from the Crypto Council for Innovation to the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Even Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are finding common cause, along with predictable parts of the tech sector including chipmakers and wireless providers..The reason is that chips are now in almost everything: refrigerators and microwaves, tire pressure sensors and navigation systems, electronic bidets and sonar equipment and, of course, smartphones and computers. Tariffs threaten to snarl supply lines and jack up costs for consumers..“There’s a large mismatch between the amount of chips we use in this country in various products and the supply created here in the US,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview. “Putting a tax on those imports will simply raise the cost, and that’s not a good thing for consumers.”.Case in point is the marine association, which warns the impact would be felt by more than 1,300 manufacturers who face higher expenses for essentials like propulsion technology, engines and GPS systems..“These systems are not optional luxuries — they are fundamental to safety, function and performance,” the association said. “Many components have no US equivalent or are only available from highly concentrated suppliers overseas.”.The boating sector’s concerns were among comments from 154 stakeholders submitted to a Commerce Department review of whether to slap tariffs on chips as part of Trump’s campaign to redraw global supply lines and boost domestic manufacturing. Predictable tech sources weighed in, including chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp. But feedback also landed from a wide spectrum of sectors, along with trading partners like Japan and Brazil..The companies, trade groups and individuals who commented on the chips investigation largely signaled support for the president’s vision of deepening the US manufacturing base and expanding the American workforce. Yet most expressed concern over the potential consequences and urged making any levies that emerge as targeted as possible.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-chip-tariff-threat-sparks-140000127.html,- **Trade Risk**   - **Market Risk**   - **Operational Risk**   - **Regulatory Risk**   - **Reputational Risk**

However, at a little over 16 times estimated profits, its valuation is a fraction of Tesla’s at 150 times, a multiple based heavily on expectations for a service that investors had been waiting years for..“People are underestimating Waymo in a pretty significant way, while overestimating Tesla,” said Samuel Rines, macro strategist at WisdomTree. Alphabet’s valuation “assigns basically zero value to Waymo even though it has the best tech, it is already operating, and it has deals with OEMs,” referring to original equipment manufacturers..Alphabet rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while Tesla shares were little changed..Investor excitement about self-driving technology is rooted in the vast size of the potential market. Annual ride-hailing sales could exceed $325 billion by 2030, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. As much as $20 billion of that could come from robotaxis, analyst Mandeep Singh wrote in a research note on Monday..Waymo currently offers self-driving paid rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and San Francisco and just began offering trips through Uber Technologies Inc.’s platform in Atlanta, with Miami and Washington expected next year. Last week, Waymo applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City, sending Uber and Lyft Inc. shares lower..Waymo was valued at more than $45 billion in October, putting it roughly on par with the market capitalizations of both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. It’s a drop in the bucket for Alphabet, however, with a market value of more than $2 trillion..Still, Waymo is an increasingly attractive part of Alphabet’s portfolio and should offer “long-term upside” for shareholders, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note last week.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-lacks-tesla-stock-buzz-101252621.html,market risk

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Automotive Dive newsletter. .General Motors has recalled over 41,000 electric Cadillac Lyriq SUVs for a software error that can cause the driver’s instrument cluster display to intermittently go blank while driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration..The recall covers 2023-2024 Lyriq models produced from March 2022 through September 2024. An estimated 3% of the vehicles are believed to have the software error..GM will issue an over-the-air software update for the video display control module to remedy the issue, but Lyriq customers can also have the update performed at a dealer for free. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed July 14..A blank video display can result in a loss of critical vehicle safety information, including the speedometer, warning lights, and loss of the rearview camera image, which can increase the risk of a crash, according to the recall report..The report also states that “continuous improvements to the display control module software significantly reduce the likelihood of a display control module malfunction” in the Lyriq..GM opened a product investigation on March 4 after being notified by the NHTSA in late February that the agency had received customer complaints about display malfunctions in Lyriq models..A subsequent field data review by GM investigators identified 1,209 VIN numbers for 2023-2025 Cadillac Lyriq SUVs potentially associated with fault. The majority of these incidents occurred in 2023-2024 models equipped with video display control modules that were not updated to the latest software version. GM received notice of these incidents between Aug. 23, 2022, and April 3, 2025, according to the NHTSA..Following its internal investigation, GM’s Safety Field Action Decision Authority decided to conduct a safety recall on May 22, but the company is not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with blank instrument displays on Lyriq models..The recall is the second for the 2023 Lyriq involving the instrument panel display. The electric SUV was previously recalled in September 2022 for a condition where the driver video display control module would occasionally perform a boot-up/shutdown cycle when the vehicle was parked and powered off. However, this sequence could be interrupted if a door was opened and cause the display to go blank. At the time, an estimated 100% of these models were believed to have the defect.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-recalls-over-41k-cadillac-080700345.html,Operational risk

This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation..Is there a buying opportunity in General Motors, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team’s opinion, it’s free..Even with the cheaper entry price, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why GM doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own..Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful Automobile Manufacturing company because there’s a ceiling to what customers will pay..General Motors’s units sold came in at 912,000 in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, averaged 5.8% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability..Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite..Over the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect General Motors’s revenue to drop by 5.3%, a decrease from its 6.9% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its products and services will face some demand challenges..Cost of sales for an industrials business is usually comprised of the direct labor, raw materials, and supplies needed to offer a product or service. These costs can be impacted by inflation and supply chain dynamics..General Motors has bad unit economics for an industrials business, signaling it operates in a competitive market. This is also because it’s an automobile manufacturer..Automobile manufacturers have structurally lower profitability as they often break even on the initial sale of vehicles and instead make money on parts and servicing, which come many years later - this explains why new entrants such as Rivian, Lucid, and Nikola have negative gross margins. As you can see below, these dynamics culminated in an average 12.5% gross margin for General Motors over the last five years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-gm-buy-sell-040308038.html,Market Risk

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday. He raised his price target to $215, well short of its close at $322.16 last week..Explainer: Why Tesla’s Valuation Rests on Musk More Than Reality.Videos of the robotaxi launch posted Sunday were mostly mundane, showing Model Y SUVs driving short distances, navigating intersections, avoiding pedestrians and parking — all with no one sitting in the driver’s seat.

Only select invited Tesla users were invited to test the robotaxi service in Austin..Scaling a robotaxi business that could take on industry leader Waymo (GOOG, GOOGL) would take thousands of vehicles operating without safety operators, as well as creating the infrastructure to clean and service the robotaxis..While some see the robotaxi launch as the start of a new era, others think the scale issue will be a big one..""We believe the much better question ahead is on the path of scaling, which we believe will be long, and we caution against overoptimism,"" Barclays' Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients Monday morning. Levy has an Equal weight rating (the equivalent of Hold) and a $275 price target..In addition to scale, there is a big concern over safety. Other players, like GM’s Cruise (GM) and Uber (UBER), had to cease operations following high-profile accidents, with an Uber test leading to a pedestrian death..Earlier on Monday Reuters reported that Tesla said answers to regulator NHTSA's questions regarding safety of its robotaxi operations was confidential business information, and should not be made public..Nonetheless, Wall Street bulls were cheering Tesla’s early success..“We took two approximately 15 minute rides around Austin and the key takeaways are that it was a comfortable, safe, and personalized experience,” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note published late Sunday. Ives has an Outperform rating on Tesla and a lofty $500 price target..In a particularly tense moment, Ives said, the robotaxi drove up a hill on a narrow road with cars parked on both sides, oncoming traffic, and people opening their car doors into the road, but the robotaxi “masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety among this chaos.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-pops-8-after-foundational-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-200136126.html,no risk

That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

22,2025-06-23 21:07:00,Ford Stock Looks Cheap at 0.26X P/S - But is It Worth Buying?,"F appears attractively valued and yields over 5%, but mounting EV and tariff headwinds raise caution.","U.S. legacy automaker Ford F is currently trading at a 0.26 forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, below the industry levels as well as its own 5-year average. The valuation also stacks up favorably against its closest peer, General Motors GM, and the electric vehicle giant, Tesla TSLA. General Motors has a P/S of 0.27X, while Tesla is trading at a much loftier 9.88X multiple. Of course, Tesla’s valuation is less tied to current fundamentals and more driven by optimism around unproven future bets, like robotaxis and artificial intelligence..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Ford looks undervalued despite the stock rising roughly 7% year to date against the industry’s loss of more than 19%. Over the same timeframe, shares of General Motors have declined almost 10%, and Tesla slid 20%..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.With Ford’s valuation looking cheap, the real question now is whether Ford has the momentum and fundamentals to deliver a real upside from here..Ford remains a key player in the U.S. auto market, with a lineup that continues to resonate with American buyers. The F-Series trucks continue to be a best-seller, and models like the Maverick pickup, Escape, Explorer, Expedition, and Edge keep Ford well-positioned in the SUV and crossover space..One of the major key catalysts for Ford currently is its Ford Pro business, which is focused on commercial customers. The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future for the Ford Pro segment. The growing interest in its software and service offerings is also driving the unit’s earnings. The segment has around 675,000 paid software subscriptions, with strong ARPU growth driving incremental revenues. Software services also serve as a countercyclical measure for the segment..Ford’s healthy balance sheet and investor-friendly moves instill investor confidence. The company ended the first quarter of 2025 with roughly $45 billion in liquidity, including around $27 billion in cash. Its superior liquidity profile provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities. Encouragingly, Ford is on track to deliver $1 billion in net cost reductions this year, excluding tariff effects..Ford’s dividend yield of over 5% stands out as an attractive option for income-focused investors, especially when stacked against the S&P 500’s average yield of just more than 1%. With plans to return 40-50% of its free cash flow to shareholders, Ford underscores its commitment to rewarding investors, even as it navigates a major transformation of its business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-looks-cheap-0-130700382.html,market risk   operational risk   credit risk

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","General Motors (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned -1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors belongs, has lost 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.52 per share, indicating a change of -17.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.31 points to a change of -12.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.57 indicates a change of +2.8% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-general-motors-130003767.html,market risk

Between April 2024 and March 2025, the company built 1.96 million units in the U.S., according to Statista..So, despite a U.S. production capacity that can handle nearly 2 million vehicles a year, Toyota still ships in nearly half a million vehicles from overseas to sell in the U.S..On June 21, Toyota said that prices for several Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles will rise by an average of $270 and $208, respectively, starting in July, according to an email seen by Bloomberg..While the price increase could be seen as a response to the 25% duties Trump has placed on auto imports, Toyota insists that the move is just part of its regular price review process..Related: Jeep parent Stellantis ponders drastic action on struggling brand.In April, fellow Japanese automaker Mitsubishi said it would hold its vehicles in port for the foreseeable future instead of offloading them and being forced to pay duties.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-makes-tariff-move-customers-191300582.html,**Risk Classification:**   Operational Risk   Reputational Risk

China’s system is improving but remains cumbersome, they said, contrary to Trump’s assurances rare earths would flow “up front” after a June 11 accord struck in London..The delays are holding an array of American industries hostage to the rocky US-China relationship, as some firms wait for magnets and others face restrictions selling to China. That friction risks derailing a fragile tariff truce clinched by Washington and Beijing in Geneva last month, and triggering fresh rounds of retaliation..Interviews with multiple Western buyers, industry insiders and officials familiar with discussions revealed frustration over vague policies in both countries and lingering confusion about what level of magnet approvals from China would trigger Trump to abandon his tit-for-tat export curbs..“Even if export approvals accelerate, there are so many unknowns about the licensing regime that it’s impossible for companies to have a strong sense of certainty about future supply,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “At a minimum, they need to factor in a real possibility that talks could break down again, and exports will be halted.”.In response to China’s sluggishness on magnets, Trump last month restricted US firms from exporting chip software, jet engines and a key ingredient to make plastic to China until President Xi Jinping restores rare-earth exports. Companies subject to Washington’s curbs have halted billions of dollars in planned shipments as they wait for players in unrelated sectors to secure permits from Beijing, which could take weeks or even months to process, given the current pace..Corporate chiefs affected by the export-control spat have sought clarity from the administration on its strategy, according to people familiar with the matter.

The industry-wide supply chain is yet to wholly grasp the impact of tariffs on production, changes in the implementation of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs. In this context, Ford announced its prediction of a net adverse adjusted EBIT impact of about $1.5 billion for 2025. It logged $1 billion adjusted EBIT in the first quarter of 2025, but due to prevailing instability in the industry, guidance has been withdrawn..Although there remains uncertainty, Ford, being one of the largest auto manufacturers in the United States, might expect certain advantages. Ford, compared with its competitors, built 300,000 more vehicles in the United States last year. This provides the company with a competitive edge. Its peers will face difficulties in increasing manufacturing capacity in the country, as that would entail huge costs, compromising affordability. Ford’s 80% parts in use are already USMCA trade rules compliant. The company seeks other ways to build more parts locally..It has also implemented smart changes to tackle impacts. Ford now ships vehicles from Mexico to Canada using bonded carriers, which avoids U.S. tariffs. A similar strategy is also followed for auto parts that only travel through the United States. Ford seems confident as it has been building more in America since 2020, investing $50 billion to grow vehicle and battery production..General Motors Company (GM), an auto giant of America, has predicted declines in profit this financial year. It imported the highest number of cars into the United States in the last year. General Motors lowered guidance owing to an estimated $4 million to $5 million exposure to the impacts of auto tariffs. However, a mitigation of 30% of cost increases due to tariffs can be expected through General Motors’ tailored initiatives..Stellantis N.V. (STLA), another multinational automaker, is also suspending its guidance for fiscal 2026 amid tariff-related challenges. Stellantis has plans to reassess its capital spending strategies. The company has also brought down its vehicle imports in April in response to tariffs.

Additionally, the company's lower-than-anticipated full-year earnings guidance and recent debt financing activities added to the mix of influences on its stock performance.

See the full list for free..The recent collaboration between General Motors and Malibu Boats as the Official Vehicle Brand underscores GM's approach to broadening its market engagement through partnerships, potentially enhancing brand value and attractiveness. Over the past five years, GM's total returns, including share price and dividends, reached 96.26%, signaling robust long-term performance. In contrast, the stock has underperformed the U.S. Auto industry over the past year, which saw a 61.6% return, compared to GM's negative movement. This disparity highlights the challenges faced by GM in aligning short-term market performance with long-term strategic goals..The extension of this partnership could potentially bolster GM's brand reputation, influencing revenue and earnings forecasts favorably in the longer term as these synergies take effect. However, given the minor short-term share price decline of 2.7%, the effects on revenue and earnings might be limited and may not significantly impact the current forecasts of a slight annual revenue decline of 0.4% over the next three years.

32,2025-06-19 23:25:00,Why forecasters can’t agree on when oil demand will peak,"Oil demand is proving more resilient than expected, with forecasts suggesting a plateau rather than a sharp decline.","Oil demand is set to plateau rather than drop off a cliff after it peaks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted this week, citing “policy settings and market trends.” But here’s the thing about policy settings and market trends: they change..That oil demand is set to peak before 2030 has been repeated ad nauseam by various forecasters, including, notably, Chinese energy majors Sinopec and CNPC. Indeed, OPEC is the only forecaster of demand that does not see it peaking anytime soon. Of course, OPEC is interested in its predictions panning out—but so is the IEA, a vocal proponent of the shift to electrification in transport and moving from hydrocarbon-fueled baseload generation to weather-dependent wind and solar, as are many governments of large oil consumers..When the IEA cited those “policy settings and market trends” in its latest Oil Market Report and its Oil 2025 report, which came out together this week, it was that shift to EVs and the move to wind and solar that it meant as drivers of falling oil demand. But there are some challenges facing both assumptions..A recent Shell-commissioned survey found that while existing EV owners tend to feel more confident about their vehicles, many prospective buyers remain hesitant—citing cost as a major barrier. “While current EV drivers are feeling more confident, the relatively high cost of owning an electric vehicle, combined with broader economic pressures, are making it a difficult decision for new consumers,” Shell’s VP for mobility and convenience, David Bunch, said, as quoted by Bloomberg this week..China remains an exception, thanks to extensive subsidies and a highly competitive market that has driven down prices. However, even in China, this model may be reaching its limits. “It’s very extreme, tough competition,” an executive vice president of BYD (BYDDF, 1211.HK) told Bloomberg. “No, it’s not sustainable,” Stella Li added, referring to the current situation in China’s electric car sector. The most likely prospect is consolidation. And that may put a stop to the continuous decline in prices..Despite this, many oil demand forecasts—including the IEA’s—still rely on projections of steady EV growth. But recent industry decisions suggest a more complex picture. GM (GM) announced it would invest $4 billion in expanding internal combustion engine vehicle production. Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST) Cars, which reported strong EV-driven sales last year, saw a 12% drop in overall sales this May, in part due to underperformance in its EV segment. These developments reflect growing pains in the transition—not necessarily a reversal, but perhaps a recalibration of expectations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-forecasters-t-agree-oil-000000863.html,Market Risk   Regulatory Risk   Strategic Risk

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine General Motors’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..Good news, investors! General Motors is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that General Motors’s ratio of 6.12x is below its peer average of 8.26x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Auto industry. However, given that General Motors’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.. See our latest analysis for General Motors .Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of General Motors, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 6.8%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term..Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since GM is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-general-motors-companys-nyse-130015157.html,market risk

I think it actually, I was surprised when I first saw the images how good looking the new leaf was, you know, but back in the day was very bulbous and swoopy and round and kind of look like a boring EV. Now they kind of added a bit more uh uh Zaz to it, I guess, Zaz. Uh it's like a little mini Ariya, the other EV, but but it's going to target a you know, some front wheel drive car, 300 miles of range, probably in the 30s, pretty good value proposition and and Nissan told me they want to they want to attract 70% conquest buyers. And most of those are going to be Tesla buyers, right? So can they do it? That's the big question and Nissan is putting this vehicle out, competitive vehicle, but the company itself is sort of in I don't want to say dire straits, but they lost a lot of money this year. They're they're going to be cutting a lot of jobs. They kind of reformat the portfolio because it's a really tough automotive. How much they how much is cost me if I'm interested in this? What are they charging? They haven't put out official pricing but an executive told me it'll be start in the low 30s and go all the way up to possibly low 40s based on trim level, things like that. But it's a competitive car, I think, and it looks good. All right, let me ask you about another headline in your world today. I want to talk about this new Corvette because here's what Car and Driver says, right, Pras? The most over-the-top model to ever be sold from the factory. Give me the specs on this. I mean, this is the ZR1X. So the ZR1 already came out. 1100 horsepower show uh V8 uh car, right? is the most powerful V ever. 16 under 2 seconds. This one adds a electric motors and now you're going to go go above 1200 horsepower, right? because you're adding electric motor to the to that powers the front wheels, you have the the honkin V8 in the back, flat plane crank, sounds like a freaking race car. Sorry. So to the race car. I mean, it is the ultimate Corvette and they they want to take on Ferrari. They want to take on cars like the Lamborghini Revuelto or Ferrari's SF90 which are which are which are hybrid super. lines on that car. Yeah. I mean look, you're going to get the best of both worlds. The best electric power in the front to kind of give you better like torque vector in the front, but then you still have the insane gas powered engine that people still want. People still want these things. They don't want pure EVs for their high performance ultra hyper cars. They want this. I shouldn't say hyper car because this car is going to come in a lot less cheaper, a lot, a lot cheaper than a Ferrari will. You sold me. I'm in. Rin, Rin. Sign me up. just very quickly, how important is that Corvette family to GM? I think this is a good question. We we joke around about Corvette but like this is a huge brand for GM. There's thoughts that they might even make a Corvette brand that would be sub sub brand outside of Chevrolet because that's so popular and and how long that name has been around the automotive world and Corvette is the pinnacle, the halo car for for Chevy and GM and and you're seeing it there. That's that's what GM can do if they put their minds to it, right? That car is going to be insane and it's already I believe lapping these test tracks beating all kinds of records. All right, when you get the chance to test drive, take me with you. That's all I ask. Thank you, Pras. Thank you.

Its shares have lost 4% year-to-date and have fluctuated heavily in June. The stock has suffered primarily due to tariffs and their potential to disrupt General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)’s supply chain. Cramer has also discussed the stock in this context several times in 2025. While he believes that the firm can face tariff-induced supply chain disruption, the CNBC host also believes that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)’s rival Ford is in a better position to navigate the tariffs. However, his latest remarks wondered if the tariff debate had impacted the stock too much and whether it could rebound in case of trade deals:.“Right well first if you wanna try to make money make off, you’re a trader, it’s General Motors, which had the most problems. . .four billion dollar shifts production from Mexico.

Here’s what he said back in 2024:.“The biggest winners though will be the American automakers.

That's according to data from S&P Global mobility. Joining us now from the Nasdaq Yahoo! Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian. So Pras, um, what is what is this data telling us about sort of, I guess things that Tesla don't seem to be getting much better. .Yeah, it's the first indication now we're seeing now US data, right? So registration data from S&P Global mobility showed that 16% drop in April year over year. Uh, this is happening while other competitors like Chevy and BMW see sales gains. So with regards to Tesla, uh, every model except the Model 3 saw sales drop in the US in April. And this is sort of coming on the backdrop of what we saw in Europe, right? We saw a lot of bad data there for sales data in Europe, mostly recently for for April and May there. So we're seeing an echo here in the US, but I want to quickly touch on the fact that, you know, we mentioned Chevy at number two, the very popular Equinox and Blazer EV doing well. BMW also there having some good models. They're seeing some sales gains. And then and Tesla overnight last night, maybe looking to address that the top in the market, updated the Model S and Model X vehicles there. So new updates there potentially to stem the losses and on the top end, but but nonetheless is still a pattern that we're seeing that has been recurring throughout the Western world and also now in the US now with April data. .And Pros of course, if people investors in Tesla have been watching other things, namely, what seems to be sort of, you know, warming, if not warming relations, at least not further cooling relations between the president and Elon Musk, and also they're looking ahead to the robo taxi launch, which has been pushed back, yes to June 22nd. So we'll see if it if it gets pushed back more, but there does seem to be some optimism building around some of this stuff. .Yeah, you saw Musk backtrack a little bit on those comments he made last week about the the the big beautiful bill talking about how it didn't really cut a lot of the spending, but mostly with the subtext of him being upset about potential loss to EV tax credit. That being said, the robo taxi launch are testing in Austin is happening. Uh we've seen some cars going back and forth to chase vehicles, but the actual official start Musk says won't happen till the 22nd. That was a push back from the 12th that was previously reported. And Musk also said the 22nd date could be pushed back just just because of of safety and precaution looking to be sort of cover all their bases with such a big high profile test happening in that city. But you know, we talked about this before, this is a big news for Tesla, big move. They need to do that to unlock the value, but you know, Waymo's been operating in Austin and also other cities for for some time now. So they have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to that robo taxi business. .Yes. We'll see how it plays out. Pras, thank you.

Meanwhile, betting site Polymarket lists only a 30% chance that Tesla (TSLA) launches the service before July, highlighting Musk's rosy predictions on self-driving that have been constantly pushed back..While Tesla is on the verge of starting a new chapter for the company, Alphabet’s (GOOG) Waymo has been quietly racking up mile after mile, trip after trip, providing actual paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin — where Tesla’s test will begin..At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently, but could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver..Waymo has an early lead, and it seems a big one. Rivals like Argo AI and GM-backed Cruise are gone, leaving only smaller players like Zoox (backed by Amazon), China’s Pony AI (PONY), and WeRide (WRD), and of course Tesla..Waymo (before it was even called that) started off as an in-house startup as part of Google’s X initiative way back in 2009..After some testing and securing of permits, the project officially became Waymo in 2016, and it started testing its Pacifica hybrid vans kitted out with cameras, LIDAR laser sensors, and radar..In 2018 Waymo and Jaguar paired up, using the British automaker’s I-Pace EV for its testing; these are the vehicles most users are accustomed to seeing..Waymo's combination of vision, radar, and LIDAR, which the company calls its “multimodal” approach, has the company claiming it has the best and safest robotaxi solution..Since 2020, anyone in a service area can download the Waymo app and hail a fully autonomous car. Waymo says it has the most robotaxi miles driven and that the company performs around 250,000 trips a week..A Waymo spokesperson said that the company has not yet seen a vision-only system that can achieve the levels of safety its current system has achieved, asserting that multiple sensors with overlapping fields of view are the best solution..Experts tend to agree..“Waymo is undoubtedly the leader in autonomous driving technology, with their self-driving software (SDS) being widely regarded as best in class,” said University of San Francisco engineering professor William Riggs, an expert in autonomous technology. “They have been around the longest, had patient capital, and have the most miles on the road proving that self-driving tech works.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-waymo-got-the-edge-on-the-competition-and-teslas-robotaxi-so-far-090019552.html,competitive risk

The plans include shifting or expanding the production of two vehicles currently manufactured in Mexico. The move comes amid slow progress in trade negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico’s officials. Earlier this year, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and many auto parts imported into the United States.GM revealed it will begin producing the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox, both presently made in Mexico, at two U.S. plants. The company will repurpose an idled Michigan plant, previously set to produce electric trucks, to build gas-powered SUVs and trucks starting in 2027. GM did not comment on the future of its Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico.  Per a source familiar with the plans, Blazer production would fully relocate to the United States, while Equinox output in the country will supplement, not replace, production in Mexico, which will continue to serve other markets.The investment may be viewed as a victory for President Trump’s auto tariff policy. President Trump proposed partial tariff rebates for companies assembling vehicles in the United States, offering temporary financial relief.This investment, running through 2027, will expand GM’s U.S. production capacity to more than two million vehicles annually. By early 2027, the Orion plant in Michigan will start building gas-powered SUVs and pickups. GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit will focus exclusively on electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ and GMC Hummer EV.Fairfax Assembly in Kansas will begin building the gas-powered Equinox by mid-2027 and the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV by year-end. Additional investment is planned at Fairfax for GM’s next-gen affordable EVs. Spring Hill Assembly in Tennessee will add production of the gas-powered Blazer in 2027.GM maintained its 2025 capital spending forecast of $10–$11 billion and anticipates annual spending of $10–$12 billion through 2027. The company has carefully evaluated its North America production plans in light of tariffs. Instead of making a rash decision, GM is taking a wait-and-see approach till it gets clarity on the regulatory environment.

GM will also begin making gas-powered full-size SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and light-duty pickup like the Silverado at its Orion Michigan plant, as well as shift EV production from that plant to the Factory Zero Michigan plant, which produces only EVs..GM said it was No. 1 in overall full-size pickup sales during Q1, which includes Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models with more than 200,00 units sold — its best first quarter since 2007. GM said full-size pickups also had their best Q1 since 2007, with models like the Tahoe, Suburban, and GMC Yukon seeing sales up 31%..“It's clear that EV demand has slowed a bit, so we're able to fill that back at Factory Zero and really convert Orion to a much better-utilized plant for full-size SUVs, which will get us some incremental capacity and help take some of the pressure off our team at Arlington [Texas], but also full-size trucks where we’ll be able to fill that plant up and have a really secure future going forward for [internal combustion engine] production,” Jacobson said..While rebalancing is a positive in terms of production and shifting powertrains in light of consumer demand makes sense, the moves also address tariffs, at least in the near term..GM said in early May that it would take a $4 billion to $5 billion hit to EBIT due to tariff exposure, though it would mitigate up to 30% of that cost due to remediation and cost-cutting efforts..Jacobson said that GM’s peak tariff exposure and impact would occur in the second quarter, as the new initiatives will take time to complete.

The automaker just unveiled a $4 billion investment plan to boost U.S. production over the next two yearsreshuffling factory lines in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. Why now? Trump's tariffs. After years of defending its Mexico-heavy footprint, GM is betting that protectionist trade policies aren't going away. CFO Paul Jacobson told investors the changes will raise U.S. vehicle output by 300,000 units a year, with pickups like the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra coming back stateside. That shift alone could reduce GM's estimated $5 billion tariff exposureone reason shares popped 2.4% at 12.54pm after the news..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with GM..It's a rare reversal. For decades, GM offshored to cut costs and sidestep ballooning retiree liabilities. But now, political risk has become just as costly. CEO Mary Barra, once criticized by Trump for closing an Ohio plant, has recalibrated. After several meetings with the president, Barra appears convinced: Mexican-made cars may face long-term penalties. The new plan brings production of the Equinox SUV to Kansas by 2027, along with the revamped Chevy Bolt EV. Meanwhile, Tennessee will assemble gas-powered Chevy Blazers, and Michigan's Orion plantoriginally meant for electric pickupswill shift gears to build gasoline versions starting 2027..The pivot isn't just logisticalit's strategic. By adding 3,000 to 4,000 U.S. jobs, GM could quiet critics and hedge political risk ahead of another turbulent election cycle. The company still plans to make some vehicles in Mexico, just at lower volumes. But the message is clear: GM is building againat home.

But Where?.Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22, as part of the EV maker's big bet on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. While Tesla gave the city an outline of its tentative plans, the company hadn’t disclosed a launch date — either publicly or directly to Austin officials — until late on Tuesday, when Musk warned the service’s debut could shift because it was “super paranoid about safety.”The proclamation came as part of an all-night series of social media messages by Musk, which included a near-apology that “I regret some of my posts” about the president, which “went too far.” The comments helped push shares up about 3% Wednesday by investors who have been urging Musk to refocus on his business empire..The billionaire has said the rollout would start slowly, with 10 to 20 vehicles, and a testing area verified by Bloomberg News suggests the initial contours of the debut resemble more of a souped-up demo than a full-fledged launch..That may not matter to Tesla’s biggest fans, or the stock price. Investors generally have been willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt in the short term as they believe in his long-term vision..For the moment, Tesla sales are tumbling around the world, its stock is down around 20% this year and analysts have lowered their expectations for the company’s performance. While Musk tries to undo some of the damage from his meltdown with Trump, the immediate impact to Tesla's shares and Musk's own wealth shows just how delicate the whole balance is. The government has outsized influence over his businesses, from billion-dollar contracts to the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles and Tesla’s robotaxi network..“He needs to dial down the rhetoric and the drama and get back to the business of Optimus and robotaxi and Full Self Driving,” Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “That is what people own the stock for — and for his brilliance and genius of course — but not for the histrionics.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-pins-teslas-comeback-robotaxis-163003657.html,- Reputation Risk - Market Risk - Strategic Risk

So, $4 billion dollars to augment their current plans to boost US production. Uh, this new investment will give GM the ability to assemble more than 2 million vehicles a year, create three to 4,000 jobs, isn't union jobs. And the vehicles that'll see more US production are the gas-powered Chevy Blazer and Chevy Equinox, which are both currently made in Mexico. Now, they're coming to two separate plants in the US. And some gas-powered full-size SUVs and light-duty pickups like the Silverado, which are coming to Michigan. Uh, they are currently, some of these are currently built in Mexico as well. Now, this is in response to these 25% tariffs, uh, Section 232 tariffs of these on autos, and also USMCA imports. Though, there are some parts exemptions and, and the moves today are sort of seen as a long-term mitigation effort, GM says, not related to the mitigation that they're doing right now to bring down some of the $4 to $5 billion in tariff costs they may see this year.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","General Motors (GM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned -3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.3% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors belongs, has gained 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of -17% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.1% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.31 points to a change of -12.2%. from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.38 indicates a change of +0.8% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for General Motors.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-motors-130002257.html,no risk

Several have boosted delivery charges — a fee everyone must pay when buying a new vehicle — by $40 to $400 dollars, according to automotive researcher Edmunds.com Inc..Some dealers, meanwhile, have decided to charge more for the cars already on their lots, knowing it will cost more to replace them..These stealth increases could help automakers cope with Trump’s 25% levies on imported vehicles without risking his wrath, particularly once cars that landed in American ports after the tariffs were imposed finally start reaching showrooms this month. They’d all like to avoid the social-media fury he unleashed on Walmart Inc. (WMT) after the retail giant said the trade war had forced it to raise prices..But the auto industry’s subtle price hikes are already having an effect. The average sale price for a new car jumped 2.5% in April, the steepest monthly increase in five years, according to the Kelley Blue Book car buying guide. The average reached $48,699, almost a record. Incentives, which once knocked 10% off the price, fell to 6.7%. Zero-percent financing deals — a key come-on in this age of high interest rates — dropped in April to their lowest rate since 2019, according to researcher Cox Automotive. And at some point, car buyers may balk..“On the consumer side, they’re seeing several thousand dollars of actual-experience price increase, whereas the factory is saying, ‘No man, we didn’t raise prices at all,’” said Morris Smith III, a Ford (F) dealer in Kansas. “Stealth is a good word for it.”.While the steps have helped car companies avoid outright price hikes until now, those are coming. Ford Motor Co. told dealers it will raise sticker prices as much as $2,000 on three models it builds in Mexico — the Maverick pickup, the Bronco Sport and the electric Mustang Mach-E. Japan’s Subaru Corp. (FUJHY) is boosting prices $1,000 to $2,000 to help offset tariff costs, according to people familiar with the matter. Hyundai Motor Co. (HYMLF) is considering a 1% increase to the suggested retail price of every model in its lineup, a hike of at least several hundred dollars, Bloomberg reported last week. The Korean company also is likely to jack up shipping charges and fees for options such as floor mats and roof rails, which could turn off some inflation-weary consumers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carmakers-stealth-price-hikes-cope-100019846.html,Market Risk   Operational Risk   Regulatory Risk

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.53%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.26%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.83%..The an automotive manufacturer's shares have seen an increase of 4.84% over the last month, not keeping up with the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 9.42% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.17%..Market participants will be closely following the financial results of General Motors in its upcoming release. On that day, General Motors is projected to report earnings of $2.54 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 16.99%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $45.37 billion, showing a 5.41% drop compared to the year-ago quarter..GM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.31 per share and revenue of $177.57 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -12.17% and -5.27%, respectively..Any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Motors should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits..Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system..The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 10.43 for its industry..One should further note that GM currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.28. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Automotive - Domestic industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.08..The Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector.

Wards Intelligence reported that the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of light vehicle sales in May dropped to 15.65 million units from a revised 17.25 million in April and 17.83 million in March. Cox Automotive also saw a similar drop in its May SAAR calculation..The ""hangover for vehicle sales has set in,"" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a note to client this week..""Headwinds for vehicle sales are unlikely to change quickly as consumers remain pessimistic, inventory on dealer lots is declining, and there could be additional payback from front-running of tariff increases,"" Sweet wrote..In addition to declining inventory leading to higher prices as dealers replace supply with higher-priced vehicles, consumer sentiment will also weigh on sales..Read more: How your vehicle's make and model affect car insurance costs.""Though sentiment generally explains little of the fluctuation in real consumer spending, particularly in the short run, confidence matters more for certain segments of consumer spending,"" Sweet noted. ""As our past work has shown, sentiment shocks take a heavy toll [on] durable goods consumption, which includes big-ticket items that typically require financing and are often the first areas consumers cut back."".Oxford and Sweet see ""the peak impact of tariffs on inflation occurring this summer."".Sweet adds that lower inventory, higher prices, depressed sentiment, and weak income growth will weigh on auto sales. The Oxford team is forecasting weak sales through the year and bottoming out in the first quarter of 2026..Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell further corroborates that front-loading has already occurred. In a recent Edmunds survey, 37% of respondents said they planned to buy a vehicle sooner in response to tariffs, Caldwell wrote, while 11% said they had already purchased a vehicle before tariffs come into effect..There is one small bright spot for the automakers: 25% of respondents said they were delaying their purchase in response to tariffs, meaning if a resolution with auto sector tariffs is achieved, perhaps some revenge buying could be coming to dealer lots.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hangover-setting-in-for-automakers-with-sales-poised-to-go-lower-173721907.html,Market Risk

The post How GM + Nvidia are changing the face of the automotive industry appeared first on FreightWaves.,"General Motors is making significant strides in revolutionizing its manufacturing processes through a new partnership with chipmaker Nvidia. Announced in March, the collaboration aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance automation, cut costs and improve efficiency across GM’s factories..At the heart of this partnership is Nvidia’s advanced computing technology, which GM is leveraging to build custom AI systems for its manufacturing operations. The automaker is using Nvidia Omniverse with Cosmos to create digital twins of its assembly lines, allowing for virtual testing and simulation of production processes before physical implementation..This is JP Hampstead, co-host with Craig Fuller of the Bring It Home podcast. Welcome to the 25th edition of our newsletter, where we go deep into one of the largest-scale tech-industrial partnerships in the automotive industry..“Using digital twins, we simulate a running production line before it’s constructed, optimizing our planning process and allowing us to scale faster while saving time and money,” explained JP Clausen, GM’s executive VP of global manufacturing and sustainability. “It also helps our team members identify and solve problems more effectively.”..These digital simulations enable GM to test and refine new production processes without disrupting existing vehicle manufacturing, a critical advantage as the company balances production of both traditional combustion engines and electric vehicles..The partnership extends to training robotics platforms for operations such as material handling, transport and precision welding. Through a combination of AI and machine learning, GM has developed systems that can identify potential issues in manufacturing, such as leaks in battery packs, allowing for quick repairs and supporting quality control..The automotive industry, led by companies like GM, remains the largest user of industrial robots in America. According to Brookings Institute data, nearly half of the 233,305 industrial robots in the United States are employed in auto manufacturing. Michigan, home to GM’s headquarters, accounts for nearly 28,000 robots — approximately 12% of the nation’s total..Detroit, in particular, stands out as the robot capital of America, with more than three times the number of industrial robots compared to other metropolitan areas. By 2015, the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn area had 15,115 industrial robots in place, or 8.5 per 1,000 workers, a significant increase from 5,753 robots in 2010.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-nvidia-changing-face-automotive-153153616.html,technological risk   strategic risk

Barriers to entry are therefore high, and auto manufacturers with economies of scale can boast strong economic moats. However, this doesn’t insulate them from new entrants, as electric vehicles (EVs) have entered the market and are upending it. This has forced established manufacturers to not only contend with emerging EV-first competitors but also decide how much they want to invest in these disruptive technologies, which will likely cannibalize their legacy offerings..The 7 automobile manufacturing stocks we track reported a strong Q1. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 4.7%..Thankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 6.4% on average since the latest earnings results..Originally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy..Tesla reported revenues of $19.34 billion, down 9.2% year on year.

83,2025-06-04 22:52:00,GM vs. TM: How Do These Legacy Giants Stack Up in the Auto Space?,"Toyota's hybrid strength, global scale and rising sales put it ahead of General Motors as both battle tariffs and slowing profits.","General Motors GM and Toyota Motor TM are two of the biggest names in the global auto industry and fierce rivals in the U.S. market. GM often leads the pack as the top-selling automaker in the country, while Toyota usually comes in a close second. In 2024, GM sold over 2.7 million vehicles in the United States, up 4% year over year. Toyota wasn’t far behind, delivering 2.33 million units, a 3.7% increase from 2023..Globally, Toyota holds a clear edge. The Japanese automaker sold 10.8 million vehicles worldwide last year, compared to GM’s 6 million. Toyota’s scale and steady performance are reflected in its market value—around $255 billion—while GM trades at just under $50 billion..Year to date, shares of Toyota have declined 1.7%, compared with GM’s decline of 8%. The auto sector has lost 10% over the same timeframe..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Let’s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth catalysts and looming risks to determine which automaker is a better choice for investors now..General Motors is holding its ground but cracks are starting to show. The automaker managed to beat earnings expectations once again in the last reported quarter—a sign of resilience—but the near-term outlook is getting cloudier..Tariff pressure under Trump’s presidency forced GM to revise its full-year outlook. The company now expects adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12.5 billion, down sharply from its earlier range of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. Net income projections were cut as well. GM suspended its share buyback program after having $4.3 billion in repurchase capacity left at the end of the first quarter of 2025. That move has rattled some investors, raising questions about how well GM is positioned to absorb the tariff blow..The company is also vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. GM expects a $2 billion impact from South Korean operations alone, where vehicles like the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Buick Encore GX are built—models that made up nearly 18% of its first-quarter sales. Its reliance on manufacturing in Mexico and Canada adds another layer of uncertainty..Even as GM pushes forward on its electric vehicle ambitions, the payoff remains uncertain. The company was the second-largest EV seller in the United States last quarter, and Chevrolet is now the fastest-growing EV brand. It also managed to make its EV lineup ""variable profit positive"" by the end of 2024, which means it now covers basic production costs. Still, that’s a long way from achieving healthy margins, and progress will take time.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-vs-tm-legacy-giants-145200551.html,Competitive Risk   Market Risk   Operational Risk

For more on the latest numbers and the state of the auto industry, let's welcome in here Kevin Roberts, Car Gurus's director of economic and market intelligence. Kevin, always good to see you. So, auto sales for May, Kevin, just looking, I mean, nice sales gains. I'm looking at Ford sales jumped about 16%, Kevin. Truck sales, strong, hybrid strong, EV not great. Toyota looks like an increase about 7% in May. We heard from Hyundai and Kia as well. Just broadly, when you looked over that data, Kevin, how would you characterize it? What would you make of it? .Yeah, it was, uh, I would say a return to normal. So, uh, I like to say end of March, early April was kind of a crazy time for the auto industry when the tariffs were first announced. May was a little bit more back to normal, uh, traditionally a really strong kind of sales month for the industry. Um, you know, end of tax season, we have, uh, Memorial Day sales. So that's been really kind of helpful for the industry. And you mentioned it, several automakers really had some strong months. Couple things I think really kind of helped there. Ford had their employee pricing for all, uh, you know, vehicle affordability has been a trend we've really been highlighting for a while now. So I think that kind of discounts really kind of helped drive sales there. And then you mentioned hybrids. That's one that helped for both Ford and Toyota. Um, hybrid sales continue to see really strong growth. Consumers really like hybrids, and Ford and particularly Toyota are really dominant in hybrid power trains, which is helping to drive sales. .Do you think we saw some pull forward in those numbers too, though, Kevin? You know, folks trying to get ahead of tariffs? .That is the million dollar question for the auto industry right now. Uh, how much, if if we did see pull ahead, how much did we see pull ahead? And where might that start to bite back? Um, you know, was that kind of Q2 sales towards the end of the quarter that we pulled that from, or was it later in the year? It's really an unknown at this point. Uh, did we just kind of shake people off the sidelines who, you know, weren't in the market, or did we kind of pull ahead a lot of volume, uh, in those kind of crazy weeks after the tariffs were announced? And it's, it's, it's a major unknown for the industry right now. .Kevin, you know, tariffs in place. So do you think these automakers, do they maintain pricing, Kevin, or would you expect, no, starting here in June, perhaps, we're, we're going to see prices start rising? .Yeah, so we've been monitoring what's been happening to the average list price of vehicles on the site. Uh, somewhat surprising, we haven't seen large shifts, uh, to this point. However, like you said, a lot of automakers I think we're kind of in a wait and see approach after the tariffs were announced. And we're starting to see a trickle of some announcements of, uh, price increases as we get into June. Uh, and that's going to be a trend we kind of monitor, um, to see if that continues and if we start to see some of that expected price inflation, uh, for vehicles as we move into the second half of the year. .What did you make of the reaction in some names, um, this week, Kevin, for GM, for example, moving lower as Trump talked tough on steel tariffs? .Yeah, so it, it's a little bit of a different situation than if we would have talked a month or two ago. Uh, we had another executive order signed towards the end of April, uh, which gave hierarchy to stop stacking of a number of tariffs. And so that should stop, um, section 232 auto tariffs from being stacked with those steel and aluminum tariffs. So there is some protection for the auto industry. Now, it's important to keep in mind that those, that kind of protection only exists for, uh, finished vehicles and parts covered in those tariffs specifically. So for parts not covered there, we could see an impact there. And I think that's what you, that, uh, uh, that kind of risk is where you're seeing that shift this week. .By the way, should kind of just see a breaking news headline here. Uh, according to the White House, UK steel tariffs, they're going to remain at 25% for now. Um, lastly, Kevin, on Tesla, I want your views there. There, we did get some numbers this week. Broadly, weak sales for Tesla in Europe. What do you make of that, Kevin? Is that branding? Is that, you know, the Model Y change over? Is that more competition for Musk over there? Is it all three? .So, uh, we, Tesla is a direct to consumer automaker, so we don't get their data in, in our listing data, so a little bit difficult to say there. What I can say from the used side of the market, even with all the noise around Tesla recently, still, uh, still seems pretty strong, uh, demand for used Teslas out in the marketplace. So can't, can't comment as much on the new side of the market, but used side still sees, uh, uh, strong interest for used Teslas. .Interesting. Kevin, always great to have you on the show. Thanks so much for your time. .My pleasure. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/auto-sales-see-return-normal-214420358.html,Market Risk   Regulatory Risk   Competitive Risk

Is now the time to buy General Motors? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free..General Motors’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 13 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business..The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago when the stock dropped 11.1% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and provided guidance that assumes a stable policy environment in the US, thus failing to help investors shrug off concerns relating to the impact of regulatory measures. A key concern is the Trump administration's potential plans to reduce incentives like tax credits, which have helped accelerate the demand for EVs. If these plans are implemented, both GM and other EV players may need to rethink their growth forecasts. A Berstein analyst added following the earnings release ""In our view, the guidance for 2025 leaves no room for errors, and also does not include impact from regulatory changes in the U.S., especially on tariffs and BEV support."" On a more positive note, General Motors beat analysts' revenue expectations this quarter, and its full-year EPS guidance came in higher than Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this was a mixed quarter, which failed to clear up uncertainties..General Motors is down 7.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $47.69 per share, it is trading 20.8% below its 52-week high of $60.20 from November 2024.

Losing access to these critical components would soon disrupt U.S. vehicle production. Per Alliance CEO John Bozzella, the matter was discussed during Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer’s recent meetings with Chinese officials in Geneva. Per Greer, while China had agreed to ease export restrictions, it was not moving swiftly enough to restore access for key U.S. industries..China, which controls more than 90% of global processing for these magnets, used in everything from vehicles and military aircraft to household electronics, had introduced new rules in April requiring exporters to secure licenses from Beijing. Exports of rare-earth magnets from China dropped by half in April as companies struggled with a complicated and unclear permit application process, which can require hundreds of pages of documentation.President Donald Trump, in a social media post, accused China of breaking the terms of a recent agreement meant to ease tariffs and trade restrictions. In response, China’s embassy in Washington claimed it was the United States, not China, that was misusing export controls, particularly in the semiconductor industry.A U.S. official familiar with the discussions told Reuters that the Geneva talks only addressed tariffs and China’s non-tariff trade measures, not U.S. export controls. Per the official, China was slow to deliver on its promise to issue export licenses for rare-earth materials. This delay could prompt retaliatory actions from Washington if U.S. automakers, already at risk due to the shortage, are forced to halt production.So far, only a few licenses have been approved, including for some Volkswagen suppliers. Meanwhile, Indian car manufacturers reported they haven’t received any permits and may have to shut down production as early as June.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shortage-rare-earth-magnets-endangers-140100181.html,Supply chain risk   Operational risk   Strategic risk

92,2025-06-01 20:57:00,Why You Might Be Interested In General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) For Its Upcoming Dividend,"It looks like General Motors Company ( NYSE:GM ) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the...","It looks like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves a full business day. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase General Motors' shares before the 6th of June in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 19th of June..The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.15 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.48 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, General Motors has a trailing yield of approximately 1.0% on its current stock price of US$49.61. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether General Motors can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. General Motors has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 6.8% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 3.8% of its free cash flow last year..It's positive to see that General Motors's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.. View our latest analysis for General Motors .Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends..Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, General Motors's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-general-motors-125741139.html,dividend risk
93,2025-05-31 21:47:00,3 Reasons to Buy This Top Auto Stock Before It's Too Late,General Motors has reduced its shares outstanding dramatically.  GM is rapidly expanding its EV sales in the U.S. and lowering costs.  The automaker's restructured business in China brought positive results.,"General Motors has reduced its shares outstanding dramatically..GM is rapidly expanding its EV sales in the U.S. and lowering costs..The automaker's restructured business in China brought positive results..10 stocks we like better than General Motors ›.General Motors (NYSE: GM) may be an afterthought when it comes to investments for many, but it may also be the best automotive stock for investors to get their hands on today. Not only does the company thrive with sales of full-size trucks and SUVs, but it's making strong progress with electric vehicles (EVs) and returning value to shareholders at an impressive clip..Here are three reasons GM might be the next stock you want to buy..There are two primary ways for companies to return value to shareholders: through a dividend or through share repurchases. In the case of share repurchases, as the company buys back shares and retires them, the earnings per share increases, which drives the value up..General Motors has been incredible at returning value to shareholders through share buybacks, and you can see how the stock price has responded as the number of shares outstanding declines..It started in late 2023, when GM announced a significant $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed by the fourth quarter. GM approved a further $6 billion buyback in June 2024, and the automaker also increased its dividend by 25%..The automaker's cash flow is capable of handling such movements. GM generated $14 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2024 and returned roughly $7.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, leaving plenty of liquidity for growth and strategic moves to offset tariff impacts..When it comes to EVs, it's not really a matter of if, but when they consume the roads globally. It's a tricky thing to balance sales of highly profitable gasoline-powered SUVs and trucks while trying to sell EVs, but General Motors has found a balance. While posting strong financial results driven by its internal combustion engine line, the company also posted EV sales up 94% during the first quarter, grabbing an impressive 10.4% market share in the U.S..That parks GM in the No. 2 spot for EV sales in the U.S., and marks Chevrolet as the industry's fastest-growing EV brand, driven by the Equinox and Blazer EVs. In even better news, roughly 60% of the EV buyers are trading in a non-GM vehicle, bringing more consumers into the brand..GM will still need to work diligently on reducing EV costs, especially batteries, for this to become an important chunk of its business, but it is the future of the industry, and GM is well-positioned in the U.S. for now.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-top-auto-134700424.html,no risk
94,2025-05-31 20:00:00,Nvidia's auto biz surged last quarter. CEO Jensen Huang says it's a multitrillion-dollar opportunity.,"Flying under the radar of Nvidia's AI demand-fueled earnings report was one of the chipmaker’s smaller, but growing, businesses.","Flying under the radar of Nvidia's (NVDA) AI demand-fueled earnings report was one of the chipmaker’s smaller, but growing, businesses: automobiles..Nvidia said first quarter automotive revenue climbed to $567 million, up 72% from a year ago. In the fourth quarter, its auto revenue nearly doubled from a year ago, consisting mainly of hardware and software systems used in autonomous driving..“Year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers, and robust end demand for NEVs [new energy vehicles],” Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said on the Q1 earnings call. “And we are now in production with our full-stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA [sedan], hitting roads in the next few months.”.Nvidia's “full-stack” solutions, like the one it provides to Mercedes, are ones where Nvidia combines hardware like its DRIVE AGX Orin chips with its DriveOS software to power advanced driver assistance features in next-generation vehicles..The company is also using its technologies to advance manufacturing by streamlining assembly lines and using AI in factory robots. Companies like GM and Hyundai will use those technologies for ""smart factory"" initiatives, Kress said in March of this year..It’s all supposed to add big dividends to Nvidia’s top-line numbers. While data centers and gaming hog the headlines, automotive could soon start catching up..“Nvidia's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year,” Kress said during the Q4 call in late February..Nvidia said earlier this year that Toyota — the world’s largest automaker by volume — would be using Nvidia's self-driving tech as well..Nvidia chips are already used to power self-driving technologies at Mercedes (MBGAF), Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST), China's BYD (BYDDY), and device maker Foxconn (FXCOF), for example. Nvidia chips are also used in some of Tesla’s (TSLA) supercomputers..The confluence of supercomputing and robotics is one of the next big frontiers for AI. CEO Jensen Huang calls it physical AI, or embodied AI, where physical objects like cars or robots harness AI to interact with the real world, for instance, with self-driving cars or robots moving about a factory floor..At CES this year, Huang said the AV “revolution” and embodied AI would likely be the first multitrillion-dollar robotics opportunity. He said this week that Tesla was a partner..“We do a lot of business with Tesla and xAI,"" Huang said in an interview with Bloomberg following this week’s earnings release. “We're going to build many more computers together. [CEO Elon Musk's] self-driving car, his Optimus robot, every single one of them is world-class and revolutionary.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-auto-biz-surged-last-quarter-ceo-jensen-huang-says-its-a-multitrillion-dollar-opportunity-120038338.html,no risk

It echoed remarks he made to reporters recently when he said the deal will include Nippon making ""an investment, and it's a partial ownership, but it'll be controlled by the USA."".For now, details remain scarce, but the idea of a ""golden share"" as part of Nippon's takeover of US Steel is being touted by Trump's allies and appear set to provide the president with yet another avenue for close involvement in the inner workings of a company..This coming provision is also part of a larger trend (with roots that stretch back years across Democratic and Republican administrations) that has seen Washington, D.C., move to have an increasing say in the day-to-day operations of major companies..Another key front is an ongoing campaign by Trump to force Walmart (WMT) and other retailers to ""eat"" tariff price hikes, with the president promising a public pressure campaign with perhaps more direct measures when it comes to those companies' individual pricing decisions..""I'll be watching,"" he told the retailer..The push by Trump for this ""golden share"" in US Steel also comes as other components of the still-to-be-finalized deal appear largely unchanged from last year, a setup that both Trump (and ex-President Biden) campaigned against..Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania has been involved in the talks and recently sketched out a structure on CNBC that included ""a US CEO, a US majority board, and then there'll be a golden share, which will essentially require US government approval of a number of the board members, and that'll allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut and things like that."".Most of that outline — save the ""golden share"" concept — was promised by Nippon either immediately or soon after it announced its plan to buy the company in 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-trumps-golden-share-in-us-steel-has-in-common-with-his-plan-to-watch-walmart-153228523.html,Political Risk   Regulatory Risk   Governance Risk
97,2025-05-30 21:00:00,General Motors Company (GM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to General Motors (GM). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","General Motors (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned +7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has gained 19.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of -17% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.1% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $9.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -12.2%. This estimate has changed -13.3% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.38 indicates a change of +0.8% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.4%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-company-gm-attracting-130011517.html,market risk

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Automotive Dive newsletter. .Battery engineers at General Motors and its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution have developed an improved lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cell design for the company’s future electric vehicles, the automaker announced in a May 13 press release..The LRM battery chemistry uses a higher percentage of lower-cost manganese to replace Cobalt, a critical raw material for EV batteries, making them less costly to produce while still delivering high energy density..GM aims to be the first major automaker to deploy LMR batteries in EVs. Its Ultium Cells joint venture with LG Energy plans to start commercial production of the battery cells in the U.S. by 2028 for full-size electric trucks and SUVs..GM’s current EV models use nickel manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) batteries, which contributes to improving driving range, but are costlier manufacture. LRM battery chemistry, on the other hand, can help GM make its future EVs more affordable..A high nickel battery cell typically consists of roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt, according to GM. But LMR cells contain around 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and “virtually no cobalt,” which can significantly reduce costs..In addition, GM says its LMR prismatic battery cell design has 33% higher energy density compared to the best-performing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) or manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) cells used in many EVs on the road today, and at a comparable cost..The new LRM battery cells are not intended to replace GM’s current batteries. Rather they will be used for some electric models along with high-nickel and iron-phosphate cells for others. According to GM, the lower cost LRM prismatic cell batteries will primarily be used to expand customer choice in the electric truck and full-size SUV markets..“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of battery, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, in the release. “As we look to engineer the ideal battery for each vehicle in our diverse EV portfolio, LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions.”.GM is targeting driving ranges of over 400 miles for its full-size electric trucks and SUVs equipped with LRM batteries, while achieving significant cost savings compared to today’s high-nickel battery cells the automaker is currently using.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-lg-energy-target-commercializing-091600969.html,no risk

If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!”.HEALTH OF CHILDREN: The Trump administration took aim at “Big Food,” Bayer (BAYRY), Facebook (META), and other companies in its report on children’s health, blaming poor diet, chemicals, and social media for chronic disease in the country, Patrick Temple-West of The Financial Times reports. In the report, the White House’s “Make America Healthy Again” commission cited food, medical, and environmental factors that could lead to developmental problems in children. Publicly traded food companies include PepsiCo (PEP), Kraft (KHC), Campbell (CPB), General Mills (GIS), Conagra (CAG), Kellanova (K), WK Kellogg (KLG), Hershey (HSY) and Mondelez (MDLZ).

The orders will seek to ease the regulatory process on approvals for new reactors and strengthening fuel supply chains, the report states.

121,2025-05-23 23:18:00,Trump threatens Apple with tariffs. He has been making such threats since 2016.,"President Trump threatened Apple with 25% duties if it continues to manufacture iPhones overseas, the latest in a long list of company-specific tariff threats. Trump has a history of not following through on these warnings.","President Trump threatened Apple (AAPL) on Friday with 25% duties on overseas-made iPhones, the latest entry in a long list of company-specific tariff threats from the president stretching back to his first term in office..He also has a history of not following through on these warnings, often ending them with a claim of victory or by simply dropping the issue..Trump himself alluded to the frequency of his threats, writing Friday that he ""long ago informed [Apple CEO] Tim Cook"" of his position and his focus on iPhone manufacturing in India. The president added that not complying would take the form of a tariff that ""must be paid by Apple to the U.S."".The companies that Trump has singled out in a similar manner since his first administration range from John Deere (DE) to General Motors (GM) and others. He has also made previous threats against Apple dating back to 2016, even before he took office..""Companies like Apple will start making their iPhones and other products inside the United States,"" Trump promised that year when part of his first campaign's platform was 35% tariffs on companies if they move overseas..In recent weeks, Trump has also called out at least four other companies by name — Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Ford (F), and Mattel (MAT) — over the possibility that they could raise prices due to tariffs..The threats from Trump do have the ability to affect investor sentiment. Apple's stock fell more than 2% on Friday morning following Trump's warning, issued on Truth Social..In Apple’s case, in spite of Trump’s years of threats and the recent opening of new US Apple manufacturing facilities around AI and silicon engineering, no iPhones are currently made in the United States now, as in 2016, and that isn’t seen as likely to change anytime soon..Wedbush analyst Dan Ives quickly reacted to Trump’s threat by posting that a scenario of Apple acceding to Trump “would result in an iPhone price point [of ~$3,500 and] that is a non-starter for Cupertino."".He offered more details as to why in a note to investors, citing an “upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative.”.Also Friday morning, Trump announced he was ""recommending"" a 50% tariff on the European Union in a separate post that quickly drove down broader markets alongside the Apple broadside..Another company often in focus for Trump during his most recent presidential campaign was John Deere, with Trump last September promising a 200% tariff on the company over ""everything that you want to sell into the United States"" amid concerns that the company would move operations to Mexico.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-threatens-apple-with-tariffs-he-has-been-making-such-threats-since-2016-151849148.html,Supply Chain Risk   Regulatory Risk   Reputational Risk
122,2025-05-23 02:18:00,"Hinge Health IPOs at $32 per share, a sign that interest in digital health may be back","Hinge Health finally goes public after a three-year delay, debuting on the New York Stock Exchange at $32 per share.","Hinge Health (HNGE), a digital health platform for physical therapy, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $32 per share Thursday and rising 20% shortly after trading to $39..The company announced it would go public in March, marking the second time it would attempt to do so. It was valued at nearly $6.2 billion in 2022 when it first announced plans. The IPO comes amid uncertainty about the health of the overall stock market and after a years-long dry spell for healthcare IPOs..Hinge Health CEO Daniel Perez told Yahoo Finance that a dozen digital health CEOs called him prior to Thursday to wish him well, say congratulations, ""and don't screw it up."".""We are not as worried (about) where the stock price ends today,"" Perez added. ""Our vision is to use technology to automate the delivery of care. And that's going to take 10, 20, 30-plus years to continue to realize that vision."".The industry peaked in the pandemic years, specifically in 2021, as demand for remote-based care options rose. That year, more than a dozen companies went public directly or through special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC)..Since 2021, it has been quiet as many of the public companies lost their value, since remote services became less relevant. But Hinge is testing the waters, and investors are watching closely for signs of a revival of the industry..Hinge aimed for a $3 billion valuation on Thursday, offering 13.7 million shares on the market. Its initial public offering (IPO) is on the higher end of the range it provided, between $28 to $32 per share, to raise about $500 million..When asked if he regretted not going public when his valuation was double the Thursday target, Perez said, ""absolutely not."".The company has in the interim been able to build a stronger foundation and become cash positive..""We had a great valuation then, but since that moment we have quintupled our revenue, we've doubled our gross profit...we swung from losing $100 million a year back then, to being free cash flow positive for four straight quarters. Very happy to go public at this point,"" Perez said..Hinge launched a decade ago in its current form, transforming from its predecessor, UK-based Marblar Limited, which was a digital technology platform for scientists. Now it is a remote physical therapy platform, with an FDA-approved wearable to pair with services. It has been growing with the support of investors, including Tiger Global and Coatue Management..The company now boasts almost half of Fortune 500 companies as clients — including Target (TGT), GM (GM), and Hyatt (H) — offering their employees zero-cost access to the platform. This, the company said in its S-1 filing, can save companies about $2,387 per member per year on average, compared to the cost of absences and costly surgeries or other interventions.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hinge-health-ipos-at-32-per-share-a-sign-that-interest-in-digital-health-may-be-back-171602674.html,market risk

The US$53.75 analyst price target for GM is 34% less than our estimate of fair value.Does the May share price for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you..We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free..We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years..A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:.2025.2026.2027.2028.2029.2030.2031.2032.2033.2034.

But Bernstein emphasized, “This is temporary, not a structural recovery.”.As consumers rushed to buy before tariffs took effect, automakers are now expected to face weaker demand in the months ahead..“Pull-forward leaves a vacuum in H2: expect a 3–4% SAAR hit,” Bernstein warned, estimating that around 300,000 units were shifted into early 2025, creating a potential shortfall in the second half..Production cuts already reflect the caution, according to the firm. “OEMs cut production plans by -6.7% from Q2/25–Q4/26,” with the most severe reductions expected in the third and fourth quarters of 2025..They add that battery electric vehicles are being hit hardest, with average planned production down 17.5% per quarter, though internal combustion engine models account for most of the overall volume declines..Bernstein sees further downside ahead: “The downgrade cycle isn’t over, estimates for H2 and 2026 still too high.”.The firm expects investor optimism to fade as summer data confirms softer sell-through and rising discounts. “Valuations have rebounded on the hope of tariff relief and haven’t priced in the tougher outlook,” the analysts concluded..Related articles.Bernstein issues a warning on U.S. auto stocks: The downgrade cycle isn’t over.Lumen shares surge as AT&T inks $5.75B fiber network deal.UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS drop on expanded Medicare Advantage audits",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bernstein-issues-warning-u-auto-145758367.html,Market Risk   Credit Risk   Operational Risk

This decision comes amid ongoing trade and tariff negotiations between the United States and China.GM had been exporting vehicles to China through its premium import brand, The Durant Guild, which accounted for less than 0.1% of its total sales in the country, per a company spokesperson. Due to major shifts in economic conditions, GM has decided to restructure the Durant Guild and streamline its operations in China. Previously, U.S.-made goods imported into China were subject to tariffs exceeding 100%, though these were temporarily reduced as part of a 90-day agreement between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2025, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 442,000 vehicles in China, marking year-over-year sales growth and the third straight quarter of increasing market share. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, jumped 53.2% compared to the same period last year. GM, which already offers the most extensive NEV lineup among global automakers in China, plans to expand its portfolio further in 2025 by introducing extended-range electric vehicles, ensuring at least one NEV option for every new locally launched model. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In April, GM’s rival, Ford Motor Company F, paused shipments of several U.S.-built vehicles, including the F-150 Raptor, Mustang, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator, to China due to retaliatory tariffs that pushed import taxes as high as 150%. Ford is considered one of the automakers most capable of handling tariffs, as roughly 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built domestically. However, Ford may still increase prices on new vehicles if tariff woes deepen.Last month, Tesla, Inc. TSLA also halted new orders for its Model S and Model X on its Chinese website after China increased tariffs on U.S. imports. New orders for both Tesla models were also no longer accessible through the automaker's WeChat mini program in China.

The committee comprises chair Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, according to several people familiar with the matter. The committee will also explore alternative ways to compensate Musk for past work should Tesla fail to reinstate his record 2018 pay deal via an appeal at the Delaware Supreme Court this year, the report says..WORSE BEFORE BETTER: Morgan Stanley says investors “struggle to justify the value of Tesla as much as ever before” nearly 15 years after the company went public, adding that the firm expects this “valuation ‘problem’ gets worse before it gets better.” Most investors value Tesla’s core auto business at between $50 and $100 per share, then “they put their pens down,” but stopping there is “akin to valuing Amazon (AMZN) as solely an online retailer or Apple (AAPL) as a seller of glowing rectangles and earbuds,” the firm argues. By the mid-2030s, Morgan Stanley forecasts Tesla’s installed base to approach 50M units and estimates that each $100/month of ARPU generated by this installed base for autonomy, charging, connectivity, upgrades, content, used sales, parts/service, and licensing is worth $80 to $100 per share. The energy storage business is Tesla’s “fastest growing and highest margin hardware business at present,” adds that firm, which values Tesla Energy at $67 per share. While Morgan Stanley says it currently does not include a valuation for Tesla Optimus in either its base or bull case, it estimates that every 1% substitution by humanoid of human labor is worth greater than $300B, or around $100 per Tesla share. The firm has an Overweight rating and $410 price target on Tesla, adding that “the majority of the company’s current $1.1tn market cap is based on businesses that have either poor disclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charged-tesla-restart-shipping-chinese-151016276.html,supply chain risk

The company is encouraging employees to contact Senators to revoke California’s waiver, which permits the state to enforce stricter emissions rules. These rules have been adopted by 11 other states. GM had previously aligned its EV strategy with California's goals, but declining EV demand and market pressures have prompted a strategic shift. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.California aims for 35% of all new vehicle sales to be electric or plug-in hybrid (PHEV) by 2026. However, in the first quarter, EVs accounted for 20.8% of sales and PHEVs 3.7%, totaling 24.5%, which is roughly 10 percentage points below the target and slightly down from the previous quarter.As EV sales fall short of projections, major automakers like GM and Ford Motor Company F are scaling back their EV initiatives. GM has abandoned its plan to produce 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and postponed several key launches as consumers prefer more affordable options and federal tax incentives face potential rollbacks.In the first four months of 2025, Ford’s EV sales declined 2.9% year over year to 27,409 units. Also, the company's Model e segment, which features all-electric models, continues to struggle amid stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024, exacerbated by ongoing pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. The company is expected to incur huge losses in its EV business this year as well. Another auto giant, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, is also struggling with falling demand for EVs. In the first quarter, Tesla deliveries fell 13% year over year to 336,681 units. Automotive margins are also on the decline amid falling volumes and generous discount offers. The metric came in at 11.3% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 15.5% reported in the corresponding quarter of 2024.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-urges-lawmakers-block-121400474.html,- Regulatory risk   - Market risk

Now, the automaker is lobbying to get EV-friendly legislation reversed..GM's 180 has QuantumScape investors concerned: Shares of the battery research start-up were down by 13.7% as of 10:45 a.m. ET..The Wall Street Journal reported that GM ""is racing to reverse the nation's most aggressive EV mandate"" in California, and urging employees to call U.S. senators and press them to eliminate the long-established federal waiver that permits California to set its own emission standards. The Clean Air Act of 1970 also gives other states the right to adopt California's environmental standards, and numerous states have done so. Of particular concern to GM is a 2022 California law that will ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars and trucks in the state by 2035..GM itself has already failed to make good on its promise to build 400,000 EVs by mid-2024, and it's postponing the development of an electric Buick and the construction of an EV truck factory. Viewed in combination with the lobbying efforts, none of this sounds like good news for QuantumScape's prospects as it works to develop, and then sell, solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in EVs..Mind you, just because GM has tapped the brakes on its EV plans doesn't mean it's abandoning them. A breakthrough in solid-state battery technology could even help to make EVs popular again, helping QuantumScape. But the battery specialist doesn't have time to waste. Its cash reserves are down to $860 million, and it has been burning through cash at a rate of $330 million a year..For QuantumScape, faster EV adoption would be better.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","General Motors (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +13.1% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors belongs, has gained 40% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.5%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.30 points to a change of -12.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -16.9%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.47 indicates a change of +1.8% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -15.5%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-company-gm-trending-130015949.html,market risk

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag..While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..The Chairman & CEO, Mary Barra, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$16m worth of shares at a price of US$53.16 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$50.37. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern..In the last twelve months insiders purchased 37.00k shares for US$1.7m. But they sold 1.16m shares for US$55m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of General Motors shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!. View our latest analysis for General Motors .For those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket..For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Motors insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$120m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders..The fact that there have been no General Motors insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the General Motors insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

It's a good thing too, because the margins and profits delivered with full-size trucks are gigantic compared to mainstream sedans..Sales of full-size trucks kept the lights on during dark days, but the question has been, ""How feasible are trucks as electric vehicles?"" Let's dig into the challenges facing trucks, and one breakthrough automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) had recently that could substantially improve costs..Here's the secret about Detroit's bread-and-butter full-size trucks: They don't cost much more to manufacture than sedans, and the price tag to consumers can be around 4x higher. But this gravy train could be coming to an end, because things are different when you enter the electric truck..For the full-size electric truck to be capable of hauling loads, it would need to be equipped with a powerful battery -- those get heavy, and they get expensive. Gone are the days when you could manufacture a full-size electric truck for marginally more than a sedan, primarily thanks to the massive battery costs..Don't take it from just me. Lucid's former CEO, Peter Rawlinson, said it's ""very tough to make an electric pickup work today."" That's apparently one reason why you'll only find luxury sedans and SUVs in Lucid's lineup and product pipeline..Here's the good news: Battery costs are going down, and General Motors has made a recent splash in battery chemistry..General Motors recently announced it developed a new battery cell with joint venture partner LG Energy Solution -- GM started research on the new battery cells in 2015.

The company just revealed plans for a new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery technology that could dramatically lower costs and boost the performance of its largest electric vehicles (EVs). If all goes according to plan, GM could become the first automaker to bring LMR prismatic battery cells to market — a move targeted for 2028..These new batteries are designed for GM’s full-size electric trucks and SUVs like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR chemistry swaps out pricey materials like nickel and cobalt for more common and affordable manganese. This shift not only cuts raw material costs but could also help GM improve the range and weight efficiency of its EVs..GM claims that LMR batteries offer 33% higher energy density than today’s top lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, all while maintaining comparable costs. This means more miles per charge without driving up sticker prices..Production is already on the horizon. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution, aims to begin preproduction in late 2027 and full commercial production in 2028. It’s all part of GM’s broader push to scale its Ultium platform and improve EV profitability..But GM isn’t the only auto giant chasing this battery breakthrough. Ford F is also in the race, and it's moving fast. Last month, the company announced that it is developing its own LMR battery chemistry at its Ion Park R&D center in Michigan. Ford has already begun pilot production of second-generation cells and aims to roll out LMR-powered EVs before the decade ends..Ford sees LMR as the “what’s next” solution following its current use of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and LFP batteries. The company believes the chemistry could unlock longer-range, lower-cost EVs, especially crucial for scaling up mass-market adoption..Tesla TSLA, meanwhile, planted early seeds in this space. CEO Elon Musk floated the idea of high-manganese batteries as far back as 2020 during Tesla’s “Battery Day.” At the time, he said Tesla aimed to create cathodes with one-third manganese content to stretch its nickel supply further. Tesla holds patents related to LMR chemistry, but it is yet to share firm production plans..GM looks set to be the first to market with LMR batteries, Ford is close behind, while Tesla's earlier concepts still await a clear update..Shares of General Motors have lost around 6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 13%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gms-lmr-battery-could-change-125100497.html,Technological Risk   Competitive Risk   Execution Risk   No Risk

Ford suffered chronic losses while GM was basking in bountiful gains..Quickly and easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks straight to you inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.The auto industry is known for its high cyclicality and capital-intensive nature, requiring companies to effectively navigate macroeconomic fluctuations. Ultimately, those consistently converting capital into earnings tend to come out on top..To determine the better investment, this analysis examines both companies more closely from the perspectives of capital efficiency and current valuations, leading to a bullish outlook on GM and a neutral stance on Ford..Several vital factors merit consideration when evaluating whether Ford or General Motors presents a more compelling valuation and stronger return on capital, particularly within the inherently cyclical automotive industry..The automotive sector is highly capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment in manufacturing infrastructure, research and development, and distribution networks. As a result, the efficiency with which companies allocate and utilize capital is a critical measure of performance..Consider Ford as an example. In 2024, the company reported an operating profit of $5.2 billion, largely unchanged from the $5.3 billion it earned in 2023. Over the same period, its invested capital—which includes net tangible assets and working capital—declined modestly to $60.5 billion from $63.6 billion. Based on these figures, Ford achieved a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 8.6% in 2024, consistent with the 8.5% it posted the previous year..Taking a broader view, Ford’s performance has demonstrated notable volatility in recent years. For instance, the company reported a $4.1 billion operating loss in 2020 amid the pandemic, followed by a strong recovery, reaching $8 billion in operating profit by 2022. Over the past five years, this translates to an average return on invested capital (ROIC) of approximately 7%. Excluding the impact of 2020, that figure improves to a range of 8.5% to 13%. Nonetheless, the data reflect a pattern of inconsistency in capital returns..In contrast, General Motors has shown more robust and stable growth. In 2024, GM reported a substantial increase in operating profit, reaching $12.7 billion, up significantly from $9.6 billion in 2023. Its invested capital also rose to $65.1 billion from $58.4 billion, driven primarily by increased working capital. Notably, reducing inventories suggests improved operational efficiency, as GM effectively converted excess stock into stronger sales and higher operating margins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-auto-stocks-general-motors-124504349.html,Market Risk   Operational Risk   Credit Risk

The company's stock experienced a 16% increase over the past month, aligning well with broader market trends, which saw a 4% rise over the last week. Despite decreased earnings guidance and a slight decline in quarterly net income, the dividend increase and strategic leadership appointments lend support to investor confidence, balancing the broader market influence on GM's overall performance during this period..General Motors has 3 possible red flags (and 2 which are concerning) we think you should know about..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 22 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..The recent appointment of Sterling Anderson at General Motors is poised to have a significant effect on the company's strategic direction, particularly its electric vehicle (EV) and autonomous vehicle (AV) focus. This leadership change aligns with GM's efforts to refine its EV strategy and pursue operational efficiencies. Long-term shareholders have seen a total return of 110.19% over the past five years, highlighting robust historical performance despite recent earnings guidance adjustments. This growth trajectory signifies substantial investor confidence fueled by enhanced product strategies and broader market participation..Over the past year, GM underperformed compared to the US Auto industry, which saw returns of 61.8%, emphasizing challenges amid heightened EV competition and global supply chain issues. However, the company's aggressive cost-cutting measures and strategic investments in AV technology partnerships, such as with NVIDIA, could contribute positively to revenue and earnings forecasts. Despite a current share price of $45.46, the stock is trading at an approximate 16% discount to the analyst consensus price target of $54.39. This price gap suggests potential for appreciation if GM successfully implements its planned efficiencies and capital allocation strategies, offsetting tariff impacts and enhancing its market position in the rapidly evolving automotive landscape..Click to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings in General Motors' financial health report..

Prices are down half a percent in April, but still were up 1 and a half percent from a year ago. Meanwhile, new vehicle prices, they were flat last month, but rose slightly on a year-over-year basis. Here with more we've got Greg Migliore, who is the editorial director at AutoGuide. Greg, just take us into your reaction from the print first and then we'll get into some of the other, uh, of course, major drivers of what's taking place broadly here within the mindset of consumers. .Sure, Brad. Well, thanks for having me. Good to see you. I mean, right now, the car business is still trying to sort out the impact of the tariffs, and I think that was evident in the better than expected CPI numbers and some other numbers you mentioned. We haven't seen a dramatic immediate effect on pricing due to tariffs. Uh, I think there just really wasn't enough time to feel the impact. But we are seeing these tariffs hit in other ways. So we're starting to see fallout as companies like Honda and Nissan are expected to report lower profits. Uh, Ford even specifically called out that its tariff hit is going to be $1.5 billion this year. So, uh, I think we're in kind of a wait-and-see mode right now as far as some of these immediate impacts for consumers. .And so, what is the overall kind of sentiment that we're seeing among consumers who are both hearing from car brands that they are, you know, putting vehicles out on the lot, the non-tariff vehicles on the lot, and then additionally, how consumers are just trying to make sure that they aren't seeing a higher price when they know that from a range of countries and how vehicles are produced in in essence that there could be some pass-through costs that they may incur one day and trying to front run that instead. .Well, I think it's actually pretty confusing for consumers right now. You're thinking yourself, hey, should I rush to the dealership and try to get something before the car I want is actually impacted by tariffs? Should I wait? Are the tariffs going to actually happen this week or this month? So, it's definitely a confusing situation. That being said, it's actually been a pretty good year for car buying. The seasonally adjusted selling rate was over 17 million by a lot of metrics the last couple months, which is a very strong performance for the US auto industry. Uh, you are seeing some companies like Stellantis, for example, offering employee pricing, which is where they, you know, try to make it basically a cheaper, you know, one-cost sort of price, and companies are getting aggressive, which I do think that could benefit consumers. The auto industry is used to operating on a very low margin circumstances for many of their products. They're used to this increased competitiveness. They're used to macroeconomic headwinds. It's all sort of par for the course for the car business. So, in some ways, I think the car world is uniquely positioned to deal with these headwinds. .And so, with that in mind, what about on the used vehicle side? I mean, we we've even heard the strategy from companies that are in the rental space, but also have a used vehicle sales arm, like Hertz. And within their own, uh, within their own recent announcements, talking about a company's cornerstone cell-right strategy, trying to maximize value, improve unit economics, and ultimately leaning into how they can communicate their own value proposition amid some of the tariff-driven pricing dynamics that they're seeing with used car prices rising and and what they essentially label as DPU declining here. How what does that ultimately mean, especially as you hear companies like Hertz talking about their best quarter for retail vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025? And where that's moving consumers to? .Well, I think when you're trying to get yourself a deal, you think used car, right? It's just a natural sort of consumer reaction to price hikes that we think will impact the new car market. Uh, I think it's a frustrating time for consumers on the used car front because you're seeing prices basically higher than ever. I saw a figure that said they were $28,000, that was the average price of a used vehicle, uh, earlier this year, which to me is kind of it's almost an astronomical figure. You wouldn't expect to pay that much money for a used car even if it were something more in the premium space. So again, I think it's a frustrating time for consumers. Uh, but for companies, you know, that do have large fleets that they're trying to offload, I do see great opportunity. You have a chance to get in there, perhaps, you know, cycle through some vehicles you might like to, you know, offload from your general rental fleet or whatnot, uh, move the metal, and make a little bit of money. So I think for companies like Hertz, it's a great time to, you know, frankly, make some money and try to even reach new consumers, remind people that you're out there. And it's it's like many things in this economy. It's not really good for everybody, but for certain segments of it, you know, there's really some spotlight opportunity. .So, how is that influencing the summer outlook then for car buying? .So, I think this summer is going to actually be a decent time to buy a car. I think the summer buying season for the car industry, you get into like Memorial Day, then right through Labor Day. People are going to dealerships. That's usually a time, it's nice out. People are interested in into getting something new and setting themselves up for, you know, the rest of the year, school year, you know, the winter. It's human nature, right? So, generally you see decent foot traffic and companies are pretty aggressive. Uh, I saw that the average, um, you know, incentive was over $3,000 last month, which is actually a pretty hefty amount of cash on the hood for vehicles. Credit is still reasonably available. It's not quite as good as it was, but for most people, it's out there. You could use it to finance your new vehicle purchase. We're seeing longer and longer car loans in excess of 72 months because people know that, hey, you can maybe spread out that payment over time. Is that the best financial decision? Probably not, but it helps you get into a new vehicle. So, I actually think this summer is going to be a decent time to buy a car. .All right, Greg. We're going to be watching closely. Maybe I'll go kick the tires somewhere, maybe. Appreciate the time. .Thank you.

Honda will also assemble the upcoming Civic, set for a 2028 launch, in the US instead of Mexico, Reuters reported..Honda's projection of a steep hit to its bottom line from Trump's tariffs on foreign autos and auto parts is the latest disclosure from a major automaker..Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet.Auto sector tariffs are taking a hatchet to automaker profits.

But inventory at dealerships may have shielded car buyers from tariff price hikes, at least for now..In April, new vehicle prices came in at no change from the previous month and up 0.3% year over year. Used vehicle prices were down 0.5%, and up 1.5% from a year ago..The report comes on the heels of Trump’s 25% foreign-made auto tariffs that began on April 3, affecting not only European and Asian manufacturers but also Big Three automakers GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), which import vehicles from Canada and Mexico, as well as a few models from China..The expectation was for new vehicle prices to climb higher, reflecting the passing of tariff costs on to consumers, as well as a concurrent hike in used vehicle prices as buyers shifted to preowned vehicles..Read more: April inflation breakdown: Food, shelter, and medical care pinch consumers' wallets.A big reason price hikes were minimized could have been dealers and automakers eating into their preexisting new car inventory, which includes imports that were not tariffed. Dealers were not shy about promoting tariff-free inventory to buyers as a sales tactic in the competitive new car sales landscape..Not surprisingly, the number of cars on the lot is shrinking..Vehicle data and buying site CarPro reports that overall industry stock in April dropped to 2.6 million vehicles from around 3 million, with days of supply falling to just over 60..The average is around 70 days of supply, CarPro said, with different manufacturers maintaining different levels. For instance, Toyota (TM) has around 10 to 15 days of supply, whereas GM maintains around 50 to 60 days. Stellantis, during its troubled summer of 2024, had over 100 days' supply in the US, though that has come down substantially..Meanwhile, Hyundai (up 19%), Honda (up 17%), Ford (up 15%), and Toyota (up 8%) saw huge sales gains in April. (Note: GM and Stellantis do not report monthly sales.).Another reason why prices may have stayed unchanged is that several automakers, including Hyundai, guaranteed pricing through the end of May, CarPro said. The firm also said shipments will soon be tariff-exposed, and further supply and pricing pressures are expected in the weeks ahead..The question is how long the automakers can hold the line on prices..“Across OEMs, we continue to monitor post-tariff reactions, with GM saying that it will not raise prices across the board but continue to see consistent pricing (up 0.5%-1.0% for the year), and Ford extending employee pricing on most vehicles until July 4 (vs. June 2 previously) while hiking prices on Mexico-built vehicles,” Deutsche Bank’s Edison Yu wrote in a note Tuesday morning.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/car-dealers-shield-buyers-from-tariff-price-hikes-in-april-162713408.html,market risk

So that's like giving us an idea of how bad it could be for them. So a a a deal with Japan could be a big deal for for the for U.S. because more likely than a deal with China for for sector autos. .And and just to be, so just to be clear, the 145% that was imposed the blanket tariff on China, that was not the tariff on auto parts. That was always just the 25%, correct? So it already wasn't the sort of that highest tariff that was out there. .Right. They had sort of hived off all the auto stuff to its own separate sort of sector tariff exactly 100%. .And a company like Tesla, the cars that sells in China makes in China. Yes. Right? So it doesn't really materially affect it. It's more about vibes I guess. .Yeah, but also there's parts that that they there are some parts that come from China that they use that they can't replicate here. So that's part of. But you're absolutely it's more about optimism and these vibes. It's what's coming up next. I think that's sort of why everyone's bidding up the auto makers right now.

Although the auto sector was excluded from the deal, optimism remains for a bigger deal.","Auto stocks, led by Tesla (TSLA), charged higher as the US and China reached a temporary trade reprieve, despite the fact that the auto sector was excluded from the deal. But optimism remains..Two days of high-stakes talks between the US and China have led to a 90-day pause on tariffs, with American tariffs on Chinese goods dropping to 30% from as high as 145% and China's retaliatory duties to 10% from 125%..Other sector-specific duties that the US imposed on China before President Trump took office this year on ""strategic sectors,"" like electric vehicles and steel, are remaining in place and are not changed by Monday's announcement, according to US officials.

While the impact of tariffs on those models is limited, the broader 25% tariffs on auto parts are of most concern to the automakers..“The recent rollback on tariffs is a welcome development that will alleviate some immediate supply chain pressures and provide an opportunity for the automotive industry to reassess its strategies,” Steve Patton, EY Americas automotive sector leader, said to Yahoo Finance. “However, the industry requires greater certainty given the complexities of global supply chains.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-gm-ford-stocks-charge-higher-on-hope-autos-are-next-on-the-docket-for-trade-talks-165633570.html,market risk

This takes the annual payment to 1.0% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying..We've discovered 3 warning signs about General Motors. View them for free..If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, prior to this announcement, General Motors' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business..Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 22.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 4.6%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.. View our latest analysis for General Motors .While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.48. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 8.8% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems..Given that the track record hasn't been stellar, we really want to see earnings per share growing over time. It's encouraging to see that General Motors has been growing its earnings per share at 19% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting..In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock..Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Let’s take a look at how automobile manufacturing stocks fared in Q1, starting with General Motors (NYSE:GM).","The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how automobile manufacturing stocks fared in Q1, starting with General Motors (NYSE:GM)..Much capital investment and technical know-how are needed to manufacture functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing automobiles for the mass market. Barriers to entry are therefore high, and auto manufacturers with economies of scale can boast strong economic moats. However, this doesn’t insulate them from new entrants, as electric vehicles (EVs) have entered the market and are upending it. This has forced established manufacturers to not only contend with emerging EV-first competitors but also decide how much they want to invest in these disruptive technologies, which will likely cannibalize their legacy offerings..The 6 automobile manufacturing stocks we track reported a strong Q1.

Electric car stocks consist of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. The electric vehicle business also includes companies that provide parts for electric vehicles, including batteries or autonomous driving systems..S&P Global Mobility estimates that around 7.36 million of the 16 million cars sold in 2024 were not made in the United States, showing that President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars, which have been in effect since March 2024, affect about 46% of the country’s auto market. On May 3, tariffs on some auto components, including engines and transmissions, went into effect..However, the administration unveiled a two-year relief plan in response to industry criticism. In the first and the second year, automakers that manufacture in the United States are allowed to deduct import tariffs on parts up to 3.75% and 2.5% of the suggested retail price of a car, respectively. Automobiles having at least 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican components are exempt; by 2025, the percentage will rise to 90%. The overlapping tariffs on commodities, steel, and aluminum from Mexico and Canada have been waived for businesses. Industry groups have issued warnings that the tariffs would increase market maintenance costs, lower sales, and boost car prices..Recently, according to the Cox Automotive report, in Q1 2025, sales of electric vehicles in the United States rose 11.4% year over year to around 300,000 units, making up 7.5% of all new vehicle sales, up from 7% in Q1 2024. New model launches fueled growth, with multiple brands either diversifying their EV lineups or making their first steps into the market. One significant automaker sold over 30,000 EVs, almost doubling its volume from the previous year. In Q1, another company that had not been involved in the EV market before contributed over 14,000 units. However, not all players grew; some established models experienced significant decreases as product strategies changed..However, the market for EVs is facing more challenges. A well-known EV brand had a 26% decline in sales from its 2023 peak of 173,000 units to 128,000 units in Q1, a 9% year-over-year decline, and a 3% decline in market share.

162,2025-05-11 19:00:00,Is General Motors (NYSE:GM) Using Too Much Debt?,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously...","Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free..Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together..You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2025 General Motors had US$133.8b of debt, an increase on US$124.2b, over one year. However, it does have US$19.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$114.7b..According to the last reported balance sheet, General Motors had liabilities of US$90.7b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$124.9b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$19.1b and US$14.9b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$181.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined..The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$45.7b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. At the end of the day, General Motors would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.. Check out our latest analysis for General Motors .We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-nyse-gm-using-110025671.html,Financial Risk

In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed..In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impacts that tariffs have had on businesses. He shared that firms are scrambling to diversify their supply chains from China as higher costs affect business margins. Using the example of the firm known for making Monopoly and Nerf, Cramer commented:.“Well I mean look everybody’s scrambling, I know that. . .[toy company’s] scrambling everywhere to be able to make it so that a nine dollar toy doesn’t cost 19. And I think that our companies are, often, not given the credit that they deserve to be able to get things to move around, pull their weight, do things overseas, David, it’s not like they’re the only ones, China, that can make this stuff. Cause the stuff is not like, it’s not like making a Grace Blackwell GB200 NVIDIA chip.”.One material that’s caught Cramer’s attention is ethane. He believes that ethane’s role in the plastics supply chain and the fact that China can’t make it can enable the material to play a key role in President Trump’s trade talks. Cramer commented:.“We have to focus on this ethylene, because it’s the one thing that they’re panicked on in China. They’re not panicked on copper, they’re panicked that they’re not getting ethane, which makes ethylene, which makes plastic. Because boy do they ever make make plastic.”.In fact, Cramer went as far as to ‘advise’ the President and his team to leverage US ethane production against China:.“But the building block of all that stuff is Louisiana, ethane. If the President and Navarros and these trade guys were to say, you know what guys, we saw that you wouldn’t tariff ethane, cause you need it so bad, we’re done, we’re gonna ship it to Korea. Then see what happens. That’s what they should do. That’s like, free advice there.”.As for the car industry, Cramer believes that Trump’s advisor Peter Navarro won’t be satisfied even if some car companies build their assembly plans in America. “Peter Navarro would say over and over, we need the engines made we don’t want the assembly,” he believes..To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on May 1st..For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

As per Wards Intelligence, new car sales in the United States hit 15.9 million in 2024, up 2.2% from 2023 and the highest since 2019..In 2025, S&P Global forecasts that global sales of new light vehicles, or passenger cars and trucks, are projected to rise 1.7% to 89.6 million units. The overall reduction of 2025 automotive estimates reflects anticipated changes in US policy following the election. There will be significant impacts on the demand for vehicles as a result, particularly on interest rates, trade flows, sourcing, and the rates of BEV adoption..Colin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, commented:.“2025 is shaping up to be ultra-challenging for the auto industry, as key regional demand factors limit demand potential and the new US administration adds fresh uncertainty from day one,” “A key concern is how ‘natural’ EV demand fares as governments rethink policy support, especially incentives and subsidies, industrial policy, tariffs, and fast evolving OEM target setting.”.Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility, recently stated that consumers who are considering buying a new car are hurrying to dealers before possible price implications become apparent. The sales spikes in March and April might open the way for future volatility. In the next three months, automakers will face new, tariffed inventory and production levels in addition to unstable economic conditions..In response to industry criticism, President Trump recently introduced a two-year relief provision linked to domestic sales and manufacturing volume, which loosened the recently imposed 25% tariffs on cars and parts. Now, automakers with U.S. factories can deduct import taxes on parts, starting at 3.75% of the suggested retail price of a car in the first year, and then 2.5% in the second year. Vehicles with 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican parts are exempt from tariffs, which will rise to 90% by next year. Furthermore, the administration exempted these companies from overlapping taxes on Canadian and Mexican commodities, steel, and aluminum.

In most cases, this would mean just the foreign parts tariff..The move will be retroactive, meaning automakers could be reimbursed for tariffs already paid. Another big exemption is that United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)-compliant parts made in Mexico or Canada will not be hit by the 25% tariff..Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs.The automakers lobbied hard, arguing that certain parts, such as wiring harnesses, would be difficult to reshore to the US in a short time period. The White House agreed and decided it wouldn't immediately punish the automakers for those foreign parts, giving them a staged setup with tariff reimbursements, so long as the cars are assembled in the US..Per the new rules, automakers will be reimbursed for tariffs on foreign-made auto parts up to an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a US-made car for one year, then 2.5% the year after, before phasing out..The 3.75% calculation comes from multiplying 15% — the percentage of foreign-made parts automakers said they would need time to replace — by the 25% tariff on foreign auto parts. This would be an ""offset” per the Commerce Department against the automaker's tariff bill for importing those parts..In the plan's second year, the 2.5% reimbursement comes from multiplying 10%, which the administration hopes will be the percentage of foreign parts that can't be sourced yet in the US, by the 25% parts tariff..The Commerce Department official said these changes to the auto parts tariffs will help automakers get more runway to onshore their supply chain, expand their plants, and hire more US workers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tariffs-on-auto-parts-are-now-in-effect-heres-how-they-work-145142653.html,Supply chain risk   Trade risk   Cost risk   Regulatory risk

Read on to know which automaker holds an edge now.","A fresh wave of auto tariffs is rattling the U.S. auto industry — this time targeting imported parts rather than fully assembled vehicles. While previous levies largely spared American-made cars, the new tariff on auto parts affects nearly every vehicle produced in the United States. Not one of the 10 million cars built in the country last year rolled off the line without some foreign components. With the implementation of the new duties, tens of billions in additional costs are looming over manufacturers, which will potentially be passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices..Already vulnerable to economic cycles, the auto industry now faces even greater uncertainty. In this environment, investors must be extra cautious. So, how do two of the sector’s biggest names—General Motors GM and Tesla TSLA—stack up as investment opportunities amid these headwinds? Let’s break down their fundamentals, growth catalysts and looming risks to determine which automaker offers the better bet right now..General Motors is the country’s top-selling automaker, supported by strong demand for its popular pickups and SUVs. In its recently released first-quarter 2025 results, GM continued its streak of beating earnings expectations, showing resilience despite tough conditions..General Motors Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Motors Company Quote.However, the company wouldn’t be immune to the tariffs. Citing uncertainty, GM lowered its full-year guidance. It now expects adjusted EBIT between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, down from the earlier range of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. Net income forecasts were also trimmed to $8.2 billion–$10.1 billion from the previous $11.2 billion–$12.5 billion. Free cash flow expectations have dropped, too, and GM has paused its share buyback program until the full tariff impact is clearer..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Despite these near-term headwinds, GM’s long-term story is intact, especially its shift toward electric vehicles. It was the second-largest EV seller in the United States last reported quarter, with Chevrolet emerging as the fastest-growing EV brand. Impressively, GM’s EV lineup became ""variable profit positive"" by the end of 2024, meaning it now covers its production costs. The company aims to reduce those losses even further this year..Strategic partnerships with firms like Vianode, LG Chemical and Lithium Americas have strengthened GM’s EV supply chain. Meanwhile, cost-cutting remains a priority. GM met its $2 billion cost reduction target in 2024 and is targeting an additional $1 billion in annual savings by exiting its robotaxi program.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-vs-tsla-auto-giant-124700221.html,market risk   competitive risk   economic risk   regulatory risk

The Trump administration implemented tariffs that included a 25% levy on imported vehicles, and that extends to imported automotive parts in May -- although it does sound like there will be modifications to the tariffs..With that setting the stage, here were three important takeaways from General Motors' (NYSE: GM) impressive first quarter..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Investors knew General Motors had a strong quarter after seeing its sales report, and its financial results didn't disappoint. General Motors reported $2.78 in earnings per share, easily topping analysts' estimates calling for $2.70. Revenue increased to $44.02 billion, also topping analysts' estimates calling for revenue of $42.85 billion..The bad news is that tariffs are projected to cause immense pain. According to Barron's, analysts forecast the impact of tariffs on GM's profit range to be anywhere between 30% to 100% of operating income -- this is serious business..Management wishes it had a crystal ball to help predict tariff impacts, but with a lack of certainty on the topic, General Motors opted to pull their prior guidance..""We believe the future impacts of tariffs could be significant, so we are reassessing our guidance and look forward to sharing more when we have greater clarity,"" GM CFO Paul Jacobson said during a media call. ""The prior guidance can't be relied upon, and we'll come back to the market with clarity as soon as we have it."".The good news is that while potential impacts could be devastating, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the Trump administration is expected to soften the impact of automotive tariffs. The automotive industry could certainly use the relief, as their supply chains are globalized, complex, and take immense time and effort to change so radically to avoid tariffs..In equally positive news, Jacobson also commented that the automaker believes it can offset between 30% and 50% of the North American tariffs..One thing General Motors has done extraordinarily well in recent years is buying back its undervalued shares at a high rate. Late in 2023, the company announced a $10 billion buyback, and earlier this year it announced an additional $6 billion authorization. In fact, GM has dramatically reduced its shares outstanding over the past decade, and its stock price, as you can see, has reacted positively.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-important-takeaways-gms-strong-133200306.html,Market Risk   Operational Risk   Regulatory Risk

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether General Motors' current trading price of US$45.30 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy?

General Motors is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that General Motors’s ratio of 5.75x is below its peer average of 14.02x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Auto industry. What’s more interesting is that, General Motors’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.. See our latest analysis for General Motors .Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of General Motors, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 8.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term..Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since GM is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock.

Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed June 9..It's not clear what oil viscosity GM will use to address the concern, but the owners manual for the 2022 Silverado equipped with a V8 engine, for example, calls for fully-synthetic 0w20 weight oil meeting “dexos1” specifications. The automaker warns customers that “failure to use the recommended engine oil or equivalent can result in engine damage not covered by the vehicle warranty.”.GM’s 6.2L V8 engine, which debuted in 2019 vehicles, is a standard design featuring overhead valves, a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rod bearing caps made of cast nodular iron..But shortly after the engine’s debut, drivers of GM vehicles complained of unusual noises, as well as loss of power and no-start conditions.

The complaints date back to 2022..The automaker closed its previous investigations in February 2022, June 2023 and July 2024 based on the available safety field information it had at the time, therefore the root cause was not initially identified. However, a further analysis of field data by GM found that vehicles equipped with 6.2L V8 engines and produced between March 1, 2021, to May 31, 2024, showed a higher rate of failure claims, according to the NHTSA report. .After being notified of the NHTSA’s probe earlier this year, GM sequentially launched another investigation into the issue.

195,2025-05-02 04:18:00,GM’s $5B tariff gut punch shows how painful it will be for U.S. automakers to adapt to Trump’s vision,"GM executives described various ""levers"" the carmarker can pull to offset some of the sting of the tariffs, and said the company should benefit from adjustments to the auto tariffs that Trump announced this week.","General Motors on Thursday became the first U.S. automaker to put a dollar figure on the cost of Trump’s tariffs: $4 billion to $5 billion in 2025..But the answer to the bigger question—whether these steep penalties will compel GM to move a more meaningful chunk of its vehicle production back to the homeland—remains as vague as ever..CEO Mary Barra described a variety of “levers” the company can, or already has, pulled to offset some of the bite of the tariffs. Among them, working with suppliers to increase the amount of parts that are compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, building more battery modules in the U.S., and ramping up production of pickup trucks by roughly 50,000 units on an annualized basis at its Fort Wayne factory..“We have excess capacity in the U.S. with the plants that we already have, so that allows us, if we want to make adjustments, we can do it,” Barra said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. She and GM CFO Paul Jacobson noted that the company has more plans to increase vehicle production in the U.S. going forward, but did not share any details..“The footprint responses and supply chain responses, et cetera—that's what's going to take a little bit of time,” Jacobson said on the call. “So as we continue to go through, we'll provide more detail on our progress on each of those.”.Asked by an analyst on the call about reshoring auto manufacturing to the U.S., Barra said, “I think we also get fixated on where final assembly is versus all the powertrain plants that we have here, the stamping plants, the fact that we've invested in two battery plants and that's what allows us to have such high USMCA compliant parts.”.The comments underscore just how steep of a challenge U.S. automakers face in carrying out President Trump’s vision of bringing manufacturing and supply chains back to the U.S., where costs are higher. The frequent changes to U.S. trade policy in the Trump administration has added to the challenge, leaving businesses uncertain if the tariffs announced by Trump will be changed or scrapped weeks later..GM had delayed its earnings call and refrained from providing a financial forecast when it reported its quarterly results earlier this week, an unusual move likely due to the ongoing uncertainty around the final form of the 25% tariffs on foreign cars and parts that President Trump first announced in March. On Tuesday, Trump signed a new executive order that said U.S. automakers would get credits and partial offsets for assembling vehicles in the U.S. and using parts that are made in America.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-5b-tariff-gut-punch-201853775.html,- **Operational Risk**   - **Regulatory Risk**   - **Financial Risk**   - **Strategic Risk**

But in an interview on CNN, CEO Mary Barra said the company doesn’t necessarily expect to pass those higher costs onto consumers in the form of elevated prices..“We believe …pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett Thursday, although she added, “Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently. We’re going to respond to the market.”.The company does expect the higher tariff costs to eat into its earnings as it slashed its profit guidance for the year. The estimated tariff cost, and the lower profit target, were revealed in a letter to shareholders from Barra released early Thursday. The letter and guidance were delayed from their planned release on Tuesday, when the company reported lower first-quarter earnings and awaited tariff changes from the Trump administration..The lower earnings guidance resulted in GM halting plans to spend additional billions in repurchasing its stock, a move it announced Tuesday. But it’s not just investors who could be hurt by lower profits. The roughly 45,000 members of the United Auto Workers union also get profit sharing payments from the company annually. They received record payments of up to $14,500 for 2024..GM is the first major company to estimate, in dollars, how much President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs will cost it. Many others have walked back earnings forecasts because of the ensuing economic uncertainty..Trump’s tariffs have unnerved not only global companies, but investors, nations and everyday Americans alike. Major stock indexes closed out a volatile April, and on Wednesday new data showed that the US gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank in the first three months of the year as recession fears abound..The auto industry has been a particularly central target for Trump’s tariff efforts, with levies already in place on most imported automobiles and tariffs coming this Saturday on many of the imported parts used to build cars at American factories..While GM is not the dominant global auto player it once was, it is still the largest American automaker, with US sales of 2.7 million cars and trucks last year..It also has been very profitable, posting net income of nearly $12 billion in 2024, excluding special items. Barra’s letter says that 1 million US workers depend on GM, either as employees, suppliers or dealers, with 50 US manufacturing plants and parts facilities in 19 states.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-ceo-mary-barra-says-104220943.html,**Risk Classification:**   - **Operational Risk**   - **Financial Risk**   - **Regulatory Risk**
