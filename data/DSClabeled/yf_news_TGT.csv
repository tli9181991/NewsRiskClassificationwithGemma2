(“Sulliden” or the “Company”) (TSX: SMC) is pleased to announce that it has acquired (the “Acquisition”) a 48% interest in a nickel, zinc, and lead mining exploration project in Poland (the “Project”) through the purchase of 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ferrite Resources Polska sp. z o.o. (the “Target”), a private company incorporated under the laws of Poland, from Ferrite Resources Pty Ltd., a private Australian company (the “Vendor”). The Project consists of the Szklary and Dabrowka concessions, each as described in greater detail below..Pursuant to a share purchase agreement respecting the Acquisition dated June 10, 2025, Sulliden acquired 48% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Target. The Target owns 100% of the Project, which consists of the Szklary and Dabrowka concessions. As consideration, Sulliden paid 62,500 euro to the Vendor and agreed to indemnify a former director of the Target for any costs relating to his former position as a director or officer of the Target. The Acquisition was an arm’s length transaction for purposes of the policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”). No finder fees were paid in connection with, and no change of control of Sulliden resulted from, the Acquisition..Szklary is a nickel laterite deposit located approximately 50km south of Wroclaw, Poland. The deposit forms a N-S striking elongated ridge with the Ni-laterite exposed in the first 20m below surface. Historical production is recorded as 3.5 Mt @ 0.79% Ni = 28,000 tonnes. Approximately 2,500 holes were drilled in the past during the Soviet era, and a technical report was previously prepared that is compliant with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) for the central part of the property (Redstone Exploration Service, February 2022). However, because of the absence of drillcore, the Company expects that an extra 30 holes will be drilled to confirm the historical inferred mineral resource described in the report. Mining would skim the laterite, and ongoing exploration is expected by the Company to investigate the as yet unexplored sulphite deposit at depth. Szklary has a JORC-compliant historical inferred mineral resource of 32.9 Mt @ 0.70% Ni (Northern Mining Ltd., filed with the ASX in July 2008)..Dabrowka is located 25km north of the city of Katowice, Poland. The property has an existing historical shaft, but requires sinking a new small decline shaft to a maximum of 90m depth. As a result, the Company anticipates that little primary development is necessary.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sulliden-acquires-48-nickel-zinc-213000993.html,1. Market Risk   2.

The company continues to benefit from its regional fulfillment network, which allows it to place inventory closer to customers. This has enabled faster deliveries, often in fewer packages and at lower delivery costs. In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon set new delivery speed records for Prime members and delivered more items the same or next day than in any other quarter in its history.Amazon recently announced plans to expand the convenience and reliability of Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery to tens of millions of U.S. customers in more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns and rural communities by the end of 2025. The company is investing more than $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026, with a focus on expanding coverage in less densely populated regions. This move is aimed at improving access for rural customers and enhancing delivery speed for a wider customer base.As of June 2025, the number of items delivered the same or next day in the United States rose more than 30% year over year. With the upcoming expansion of its delivery network, Amazon is positioned to increase the volume of ultra-fast deliveries even further. The plans are expected to support continued growth in shipping speed and reliability, reinforcing the company’s online store performance.Amazon’s Online Stores segment generated $57.4 billion in revenues in the first quarter of 2025, up 5% year over year. This segment accounted for 36.9% of Amazon’s total quarterly revenues. Our model estimate for Online Stores’ revenues in 2025 is pegged at $263.8 billion, indicating 6.8% growth year over year..Several players are competing with Amazon in the e-commerce logistics space in the United States, with Target TGT and Walmart WMT expanding rapidly..Target has evolved from just being a pure brick-and-mortar retailer to an omni-channel entity.

The maker of Crest, Tide and other staples of daily living has paid a quarterly dividend to shareholders for 135 consecutive years, and raised the amount annually for 69 consecutive years—a rare achievement that highlights P&G's strategic foresight and ability to weather economic challenges..The strategy has led P&G to pull ahead of arch-rival Unilever, more than doubling its stock price over the past decade. From January to December 2024, P&G share prices saw a 17% spike  as it invested in digital marketing in China and shored up its supply chain.

If so, that's certainly understandable. These aren't exactly the most encouraging of times, after all..Just don't let short-term headlines prevent you from staying focused on the long-term picture. The global economy is actually rather resilient, capable of eventually overcoming any hurdle put in front of it. The market reliably follows that. The only adjustment you might want to make here is owning a few more income-producing investments, and a little less growth..If you've got $3,000 -- or any other amount -- you're looking to deploy, here's a rundown of three dividend stocks that would work well in almost every income-minded investor's portfolio..There's no denying that mega-retailer Walmart has trounced smaller rival Target (NYSE: TGT) over the past few years. Target's more discretionary selection of merchandise just hasn't resonated with inflation-weary consumers, who've been more interested in the value-priced consumer staples that only Walmart can offer..As the old cliché goes though, nothing lasts forever. Given enough time, things change..And Target's change may be coming..This doesn't seem to be the case with just a quick glance at the company's recent results. Target's first-quarter sales slipped nearly 3%, while its same-store sales fell 3.8% year over year. That's a reversal of the modest progress seen as of the end of last year..Analysts still expect shallow rekindled growth beginning later this year into next year though, perhaps boosted by the newly created office of enterprise acceleration meant to make the company more agile and nimble. The company also recently hired a new chief digital officer and a chief stores officer who is responsible for customers' complete in-store experience. While there's no guarantee these hires will actually drive the growth they're expected to spur, they do suggest Target finally recognizes it needs to do more, and/or do something else..None of these developments will directly impact Target stock's dividend anytime soon either, to be clear -- not that it was a worry. Even with the company's recent challenges its dividend was never in any real jeopardy. Indeed, it's now been raised for 54 consecutive years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smartest-dividend-stocks-buy-3-072000206.html,no risk

These sites are not open to public customers despite typically looking like a traditional brick-and-mortar outpost..According to the report, these locations would carry popular items, which would effectively amplify the reach of existing stores and bigger warehouses that fulfill orders..This wouldn’t be the first time Walmart has operated dark stores, with the company experimenting with them during the Covid-19 pandemic when stay-at-home laws were put in place..As far as completing its objective goes, Walmart has already made plenty of inroads to swifter shipping. Over the past year, the number of deliveries made in less than three hours grew by 91 percent, said CEO Doug McMillon in May..Much of this can be attributed to the company’s offering of store-fulfilled delivery to 93 percent of U.S. households, as well as more densified delivery routing. And for the remaining deliveries from fulfillment centers, the retailer has gone all-in on automation across unloading, receiving, picking and packing in recent years..Like the delivery windows, the company’s delivery costs have plummeted as a result of the changes, helping Walmart U.S. achieve e-commerce profitability in the first quarter for its first online profit ever..Target has similarly leveraged same-day delivery recently to cut delivery costs, but these expenses still weigh on overall margins compared to its chief competitor.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-double-down-delivery-202138720.html,Operational Risk   Competitive Risk

However, in recent times, Target has failed to keep the growth momentum going as shoppers have watched their budgets, favoring essentials instead of higher-margin discretionary items; as theft from stores has taken a toll; as tariffs have raised prices; and as people have stayed away due to the company's reversing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts..These elements have weighed on revenue growth and share price performance in recent quarters, and so far this year, Target stock has dropped 28%. Now, you may wonder if this growth problem will continue and further hurt the stock. Or, if this is  a once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity before the stock goes parabolic? There's no way to predict the future, but let's take a look..Target's share performance troubles extend beyond just this year. It's down more than 60% from highs back in 2021. One of the latest headwinds has been President Donald Trump's plan to launch tariffs on imports. The concern is Target and other retailers would have to absorb the extra costs or pass them on to the consumer -- and both scenarios could hurt earnings..Though the tariff situation remains uncertain, some bright spots have appeared. Initial trade agreements with the U.K. and China suggest levels may not be as high as initially expected. And Target's own efforts -- such as negotiating with vendors and adjusting product assortment -- could limit impact, too..Meanwhile, Target, recognizing its growth problem, took a big step to address it recently by creating an ""enterprise acceleration office."" This team's goal is to speed up progress along the path to growth by reducing complexity across the company. This might include simplifying various processes or using technology in new ways, Target says. Any progress here could drive improvements in earnings in the quarters to come and lift the stock..Target also has some key advantages that could help position it for long-term success. One of these is the company's $31 billion portfolio of owned brands across themes from Art Class apparel for tweens to the Good & Gather food line and Casaluna in bed and bath. Owned brands are a valuable asset because Target has a significant amount of control over costs and potential to generate higher margins. The billion-dollar sales figures of one-quarter of these 40 brands illustrate their popularity, showing they can be major growth drivers for the company over time.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-down-28-2025-once-081000912.html,market risk   financial risk   operational risk

Big-box retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) has been one of the S&P 500's worst-performing stocks this year.","Target has struggled to grow its sales in recent years..Concerns about the economy are weighing on discretionary spending, and that is hurting its business..The stock is trading at less than 11 times its trailing earnings, which is far lower than normal..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Big-box retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) has been one of the S&P 500's worst-performing stocks this year. Poor growth numbers and concerns about the overall economy have been weighing on its valuation of late. The stock is trading at levels it hasn't been at in multiple years..While Target's stock does look cheap, investors may be worried that it's not necessarily a bargain but instead a value trap and that the stock may be destined to fall even lower. Is that the case with Target, or could the market be overreacting to its recent struggles? Is it a stock worth adding to your portfolio today?.The big problem with Target is that its business has been sluggish, and that's been going on for a while. The company experienced a boom amid the pandemic, but it has been difficult for it to simply generate positive growth in recent quarters..Target relies heavily on discretionary spending, which makes it vulnerable to slowing economic conditions. And what's most concerning is that the worst may still be to come -- a full-blown recession..For now, the economy is still doing relatively well, but if there's more of a slowdown and consumers further tighten up spending, then Target's top line may go on a much deeper nosedive in future quarters. The company is looking at raising prices due to tariffs, which may only exacerbate its current situation..This year, shares of Target have declined by around 30% (as of June 20). It's been a brutal start that has pulled the stock down to levels it hasn't been at since early 2020. And the decline is also evident through the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, which is well below its five-year average..This steep discount highlights just how worried investors appear to be about the business. If the P/E is very low, that signifies that investors aren't confident about its future growth and are likely pricing in more challenging times ahead..On the flip side, however, such a low valuation gives investors a bit of a margin of safety and buffer. If the company doesn't perform well, by investing in it at a discount, you may not be all that vulnerable to a steep drop in price. In the best-case scenario, where the business performs better than expected, the stock could be in a prime position to take off.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-30-target-stock-bargain-171400601.html,Market Risk   Credit Risk   Operational Risk   Reputational Risk
13,2025-06-24 23:48:00,Target's Core Operating Margin Slides to 3.7%: Tougher Road Ahead?,"TGT's core operating margin drops to 3.7% in Q1, exposing pressures from markdowns, digital costs and sluggish sales.","Target Corporation’s TGT core operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 came in at 3.7%, excluding the impact of a one-time litigation settlement related to credit card interchange fees. This figure represents a notable contraction compared to the reported 6.2% operating margin, which included the $593 million pre-tax gains from the settlement. The underlying 3.7% reveals a more challenging picture, marking a 160-basis-point decline from the year-ago period.Several factors contributed to this squeeze. The gross margin, for instance, contracted to 28.2% from 28.8% in the prior year. This stemmed from increased markdown activity and rising costs tied to digital fulfillment and supply-chain operations. The margin pressure was influenced by higher digital sales penetration and expenses related to the ramp-up of new supply-chain facilities. While Target saw relief from easing inventory shrink, it was not enough to offset the pressure.Concurrently, the selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expense rate, excluding the litigation gains, would have been higher at 21.7%, reflecting continued investments in pay, benefits and deleveraging from lower sales. This combination of a tighter gross margin and persistent SG&A expenses in the absence of one-time boosts impacted the core operating margin. Target hinted that challenges experienced in the first quarter, including sales pressure, potential impacts from tariffs and incremental costs related to inventory adjustments, may extend into the second quarter. However, management also expects to continue benefiting from improvements in inventory shrink and gains in operational productivity. We expect the operating margin to shrink 110 basis points in the second quarter..Walmart Inc.’s WMT gross margin expansion appears increasingly supported by structural advantages, yet headwinds loom. Walmart continues leveraging disciplined inventory management and improved e-commerce economics to drive gross margin gains, with the U.S. gross margin up 25 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Walmart's e-commerce profitability and mix shift toward high-margin advertising and membership are helping offset pressure from tariffs. However, elevated tariffs, especially on Chinese imports, are a concern.Dollar General Corporation’s DG first-quarter fiscal 2025 gross margin expanded 78 basis points to 31%, driven by a 61-basis-point improvement in shrink and higher inventory markups. Dollar General’s ability to sustain margin improvement will be tested by tariff-related cost pressures. While mitigation strategies are in place, including vendor negotiations and sourcing diversification, Dollar General may face margin constraints.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/targets-core-operating-margin-slides-154800815.html,Financial Risk   Operational Risk

WMT continues to make impressive strides in the e-commerce space, reporting a 22% jump in global e-commerce sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The growth comes on the back of its robust omnichannel strategy, which blends the strengths of its physical store network with expanding digital capabilities.The retail giant has been relentless in optimizing store-fulfilled pickup and delivery services, which have emerged as key growth drivers.

Its ability to leverage physical stores as e-commerce fulfillment hubs is proving to be a game-changer.As consumer preferences increasingly lean toward speed, convenience and personalization, Walmart appears well-positioned to sustain its online momentum.

17,2025-06-24 20:00:00,Why Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Looks Like A Quality Company,"While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like...","While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), by way of a worked example..Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..The formula for ROE is:.Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity.So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:.28% = US$4.2b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2025)..The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit.. See our latest analysis for Target .Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Target has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Consumer Retailing industry..That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Target..Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used..Target does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.04. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-target-corporation-nyse-tgt-120023997.html,no risk

All of these factors -- particularly the import tariff announcements -- have weighed on investors' appetite for stocks..But in recent weeks, trade talk progress has lifted investor optimism, and this, along with strong corporate earnings reports, has helped the S&P 500 return to positive territory for the year.

It's the world's No. 1 search engine, and its presence in our daily routine and Alphabet's moves to use artificial intelligence (AI) to continually improve results should help it remain on top. This is key because Alphabet generates most of its revenue through advertisements across the Google platform..Alphabet's Google Cloud also is proving to be a huge part of the revenue picture, generating double-digit quarterly growth in recent times. Again, AI is part of the story as Alphabet makes available a wide range of AI tools for customers. With AI growing in leaps and bounds and Alphabet's price low, now is the perfect time to invest..Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) doesn't yet have products on the market so we can't use traditional valuation metrics to assess the stock price.

That means Target has endured recessions, political cycles, you name it. Yet, it continues to march on..Admittedly, Target is working through some issues right now. The company's sales have declined over the past few years, due to a combination of things:.American shoppers are struggling amid continued inflation following the pandemic and high interest rates..Tariff uncertainty is weighing on consumer sentiment..There's fallout from its decision to dial back several diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives earlier this year..Target specializes in unique store branding and merchandise partnerships. Food, beverages, and household essentials only accounted for 40% of total merchandise sales last year. Therefore, as people cut back on things they may want in favor of things they need, Target will feel that pain..Fortunately, the economy has always been cyclical, and there's a good chance that consumer spending will bounce back over time. Additionally, Target recently announced a new Enterprise Acceleration Office, which is essentially a management shakeup to try to execute ideas faster and more effectively.

Costco continues to deliver market-beating returns, justifying its premium price tag.  Target is a risky turnaround story, priced for pessimism but showing signs of a strategic comeback.","Roku is a long-term growth play with recent volatility and a promising ad partnership with Amazon..Costco continues to deliver market-beating returns, justifying its premium price tag..Target is a risky turnaround story, priced for pessimism but showing signs of a strategic comeback..10 stocks we like better than Roku ›.The stock market has been less predictable than usual lately. As I'm writing this on June 20, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index is up only 1.5% year to date. But this mellow return included a deep dip in April, so the index has gained 24% from the bottom of its 52-week low..So, things are extra volatile this year, and I understand if you'd rather keep some cash on hand right now. But even now, a few stocks can inspire me to put my extra cash to work. Read on to see why my hand hovers over the ""buy"" button for Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Costco (NASDAQ: COST), and Target (NYSE: TGT) in June 2025..Media-streaming technology veteran Roku has had quite a ride lately. Its stock price shot up by 50% over the past year but has taken a slight detour more recently, dropping 3% in the last six months..The growth story is still alive and well, with excitement over new deals, such as the recent Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ad partnership, keeping optimism afloat. However, the company still isn't showing a profit, so valuation ratios based on profitability don't make any sense. Instead, you can look at Roku's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which sits at a reasonable 2.8. That metric floated in double-digit territory four years ago..For now, Roku is acting a bit like the kid in class who has tons of potential but hasn't quite turned in the homework -- yet. The platform is growing, and recent partnerships could be a game changer, but the market wants to see proof that all these moves will translate to real, scalable profits. That's why Roku's stock looks cheap in this period of growth-focused operations and limited profits..If you're in it for the long haul and don't mind a few twists and turns, Roku still looks like a compelling candidate for a growth-focused portfolio. It's one of the few stocks I don't mind buying right now since its short-term price moves tend to be unpredictable anyway. This is a long-term growth idea..Wholesale warehouse retailer Costco is a different story. The stock has been soaring for years, lifting the P/S ratio to a lofty 1.6. That would be low in the high-growth media-streaming market, but Costco's valuation looks luxurious next to other large-scale retailers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-favorite-stocks-buy-now-115300904.html,market risk   company-specific risk   no risk
25,2025-06-21 16:25:00,Dividend Investing: Is This High-Yield Dividend King a Buy After a Dip?,Target stock offers a dividend yield of almost 4.8%.  Its stock is down nearly 65% since 2021 amid a variety of challenges.  The company's dividend stability likely comes down to the strength of its free cash flow.,"Target stock offers a dividend yield of almost 4.8%..Its stock is down nearly 65% since 2021 amid a variety of challenges..The company's dividend stability likely comes down to the strength of its free cash flow..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.When it comes to income investing, many investors will turn to Dividend Kings. These stocks have increased their payouts every year for at least 50 years, drawing investors with their decades-long track record of stability..Of those stocks, Target (NYSE: TGT) has drawn attention for its relatively high yield. However, that dividend return has risen amid sales declines from a sluggish economy and public relations missteps. That leaves investors to figure out whether they should dismiss the company's challenges and pursue that yield, or stay away..Indeed, it is hard not to like Target on the surface. The footprint of nearly 2,000 stores across all 50 states bolsters the company and is a key competitive advantage. With more than 75% of the U.S. population within 10 miles of a Target location, only Walmart can surpass its ability to combine in-store and online retailing..That presence has helped support a lucrative dividend. Amid its recent payout hike, the company now pays investors $4.56 per share annually, a dividend yield of just under 4.8%. Considering the S&P 500's average yield of approximately 1.3%, Target stock could draw investors primarily for its payout..Moreover, in fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 1), Target generated almost $4.48 billion in free cash flow, well above the $2.05 billion dividend costs, so longer-term data show Target maintains a sustainable payout. Also, the recent dividend increase has given Target a 54-year history of payout hikes, maintaining its place as a Dividend King..Admittedly, such a status does not negate its right to reduce or eliminate the payout in theory. Nonetheless, such a move would likely undermine confidence in the stock, as evidenced by the history of other companies that abandoned decades-long dividend increase streaks..With its challenges, Target's stock is down by nearly 65% from its 2021 high. But even with its rock-bottom 11 P/E ratio, a dividend cut would probably lead to further stock selling, a scenario management likely wants to avoid..However, investors may need to accept some risks and watch free cash flows. Despite its positive free cash flows in 2024, Target reported $515 million in negative free cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended May 3), a time when it also had to pay $510 million in dividends.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-investing-high-yield-dividend-082500974.html,Market Risk   Credit Risk   Liquidity Risk

27,2025-06-20 21:28:00,Sprouts Farmers vs. Target: Which Retail Stock Holds More Promise Now?,"SFM surges ahead with robust sales growth, digital gains and store expansion as TGT faces slow traffic and softer guidance.","Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM and Target Corporation TGT may differ in scale and strategy, but both are key players in the retail landscape. SFM, with a market capitalization of approximately $15.8 billion and more than 440 stores, specializes in fresh, natural and organic foods tailored to health-conscious consumers. Target operates more than 1,900 stores and boasts a market capitalization of $43.2 billion, offering groceries as part of its expansive one-stop-shop model that spans household goods, apparel and more. Both retailers are navigating a changing consumer landscape shaped by inflation, value-driven behavior and shifting shopping habits. Sprouts Farmers focuses on disciplined growth and a specialized retail experience, while Target leverages its scale and broad assortment to drive traffic. Let’s dive deep into the stocks to determine which stands out as the better bet today..Sprouts Farmers' commitment to providing fresh produce and health-oriented products aligns with the increasing consumer demand for healthier food options. The overall market for natural and organic food at home, which SFM targets, is estimated to be around $290 billion within the total $1.6 trillion spent on food at home. Its private-label products continue to gain traction, accounting for 24% of total sales, with 300 new items launched last year, fostering customer loyalty. This supports SFM’s full-year 2025 guidance, which includes net sales growth of 12% to 14%.To strengthen customer relationships, SFM has initiated the rollout of its new loyalty program, which is already showing positive signs. Piloted in 35 stores in late 2024, the program achieved sign-ups and scan rates above targets. A broader launch begins in the second half of 2025, starting in Arizona. Sprouts Farmers also began self-distributing fresh meat and seafood through its distribution centers. This move provides greater control, enhances freshness and optimizes existing supply-chain capacity. SFM aims to open at least 35 new stores in 2025, targeting approximately 10%-unit growth, backed by a solid pipeline of 120 approved sites and more than 85 signed leases. Its new small-box format (23,000 sq. ft.) supports efficient, lower-risk expansion. These locations generate approximately $13 million in first-year sales and grow 20-25% over four years, delivering cash-on-cash returns in the low-to-mid 30% range by year five. Management sees “plenty of white space” to expand the footprint to 1,000+ stores over time.Sprouts Farmers has adopted a multi-channel strategy with significant investments in digital infrastructure, online ordering and delivery. Collaborations with Uber Eats, DoorDash and Instacart have enhanced its digital reach, with e-commerce now representing 15% of total sales, marking a 28% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of 2025.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sprouts-farmers-vs-target-retail-132800131.html,market risk
28,2025-06-20 20:00:00,The past three years for Target (NYSE:TGT) investors has not been profitable,Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But if you try your hand...,"Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But if you try your hand at stock picking, you risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shareholders, since the share price is down 37% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 57%. And over the last year the share price fell 35%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted..Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)..Target saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 9.0% per year, over the last three years. The share price decline of 14% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy. This increased caution is also evident in the rather low P/E ratio, which is sitting at 10.33..The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)..It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow..As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Target the TSR over the last 3 years was -31%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!.Target shareholders are down 33% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 12%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.5% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It owns more than 15,600 single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. and eight other countries..The company has attracted numerous stable businesses to fill its buildings. Walmart, CVS, and AMC Theaters are among the companies that rent property from Realty Income. Also, since these are net lease deals, the client covers maintenance, property tax, and insurance costs, providing Realty Income with stable revenue streams..Despite continued growth, investors have soured on Realty Income in recent years as higher interest rates weighed on its profitability. Consequently, the stock has not returned to its highs from early 2020..Still, that pessimism helped raise the dividend. Shareholders receive monthly payouts of $0.269 per share, or nearly $3.23 per share annually. New buyers can earn a dividend yield of over 5.5%. That should increase as the company raised the dividend four times in just the last year and at least once a year since its inception in 1994..Realty Income stock trades at just 14 times its funds from operations income. That valuation, along with its generous dividend yield, should draw investors back to the stock regardless of what happens with interest rates..Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) has consistently stood out in the networking space, offering a range of products that include hardware, software, telecom equipment, cybersecurity platforms, and other tech-related products..It enjoyed a strong run during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, so much so that the company briefly held the title of world's largest market cap in 2000.

While Amazon isn't a Symbotic customer, its competitors Walmart and Target are.  It's likely investors believe Amazon's AI-forward message will be beneficial for Symbotic, too.","Today, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that Amazon's workforce would shrink going forward due to AI and automation..While Amazon isn't a Symbotic customer, its competitors Walmart and Target are..It's likely investors believe Amazon's AI-forward message will be beneficial for Symbotic, too..10 stocks we like better than Symbotic ›.Shares of robotics giant Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) rallied about 16% on Wednesday as of 3 p.m. EDT..There wasn't much in the way of company-specific news today; however, a comment from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy may have made investors more bullish on the future of warehouse automation and robotics. Considering Symbotic's leadership in the space and low public float, the stock made a dramatic move higher on the news..Today, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a memo to employees, describing how Amazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to its benefit across its entire business empire, from the Amazon retail site to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, to its fulfillment network. Over time, Jassy stated, ""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs."".Specifically regarding Amazon's warehouses, Jassy noted, ""In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots--all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed."".Why would that lead to such a big surge in Symbotic's stock? Well, for all its big customers, including Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Target, and grocery chain Albertsons, investors may have been a bit unsure exactly how big Symbotic's business can get. So, Jassy's comments today may have increased conviction that fully automated warehouses are, in fact, the future..In addition, Symbotic's publicly traded float accounts for a relatively small amount of total shares outstanding. As of last September's annual report, the company's public A shares only comprise 18% of all shares outstanding, with the remainder held by the company's founders and large customer Walmart. Additionally, that small float had a high short interest on it, with roughly 40% of the public float and 15% of total shares outstanding sold short. So, today's positive sentiment change may be forcing short sellers to cover, turbo-charging the rally..When factoring in the non-public shares, Symbotic trades at about 10 times trailing-12-month sales, while profitability is still a touch below breakeven.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-symbotic-rocketed-16-higher-193300936.html,no risk

WMT continues to prove its retail dominance with another strong record in comparable sales. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Walmart U.S. reported comparable sales growth of 4.5%, excluding fuel, driven by transaction improvement of 1.6% and an average ticket increase of 2.8%, as well as strong e-commerce growth. The gains were broad-based, with notable momentum in food and consumables, wherein Walmart continues to gain market share. Health and wellness also surged with high-teens growth, thanks to strong prescription volumes and over-the-counter products.Complementing the strong performance at Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club U.S. posted a robust 6.7% increase in comparable sales, excluding fuel. The rise was primarily volume-driven, with strength in Member’s Mark products.Walmart’s ability to deliver consistent comparable sales gains stems from its balanced omnichannel strategy, featuring faster delivery speeds, which includes a 91% year-over-year rise in sub-three-hour delivery, disciplined inventory management and aggressive price rollbacks. More than 5,000 items saw price reductions in the fiscal first quarter, enhancing Walmart's value proposition across key categories. The retailer also leaned on private label strength, with grocery private brand penetration up 60 basis points compared with the last year.This performance demonstrates Walmart's agility and customer relevance amid economic and trade-related headwinds. As the company navigates tariff-related pressures, the replenishment-heavy model and deep supply-chain partnerships are helping it remain flexible, protect margins and support price leadership in a volatile cost environment..While Walmart U.S. delivered comparable sales growth, two of its competitors, Target Corporation TGT and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, offer an instructive contrast.Target is pursuing long-term growth through digital expansion, marketplace scaling and store investments. Despite a 3.8% decline in comparable sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Target continues to see strength in same-day services like Drive Up and Shipt. The company is also growing the Target Plus marketplace, positioning it for future comparable sales improvements through innovation and customer convenience.Costco, by contrast, reported comparable sales growth of 5.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, with U.S. comparable sales up 6.6%. Its brand name, geographical reach and curated product breadth continue to attract value-conscious shoppers.

37,2025-06-18 21:00:00,Target Corporation (TGT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Target (TGT) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.","Target (TGT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -3.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $2.05 per share, indicating a change of -20.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.4% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $7.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -15.2%. This estimate has changed -12% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.07 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.2%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-tgt-attracting-investor-130004838.html,no risk

He often discusses the firm in the context of other retailers such as Walmart and Costco. However, while Cramer is optimistic about Walmart and Costco’s ability to withstand the inflationary impacts of President Trump’s tariff, he isn’t so confident about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). A key point on Cramer’s mind is price. He has asserted multiple times that the firm has to lower its prices and bring them down to pre-COVID levels in order to be competitive. Cramer holds this opinion because Walmart and Costco are able to leverage their scale to provide customers with lower prices and attract foot traffic. Here are his latest thoughts about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):.“I think Target has to really start making a statement that we’re going to lower prices. Now they’re going to say they have lower prices. They’re going to have to lower them to 2018. . . in every aisle there has to be two to three items that are 2018. That’s what they have to do..In his previous comments about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Cramer discussed the firm’s business in detail:.“Right but Brian was very upset. Wanted to do much better. Recognizes that frankly that his prices might be too high. Has to discount more. . .look, let’s just call it. It was a bad quarter. Now I know when I pressed him on these DEI issues when there was backlash, he did not say there was. And I just went back and asked about the conference call that they just did with reporters and again, he’s just insisting that it’s not really, it’s not, just not mentioning it as being a factor.

TGT stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.36, lower than the industry’s average of 32.47..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.This valuation looks compelling when compared to other discount stores such as Dollar General Corporation DG, Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST. Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Costco are all trading at higher forward P/E ratios of 18.72, 16.81, and 50.74, respectively.While Target’s valuation appears attractive, much of that discount stems from the stock’s decline in 2025. Shares of TGT are down 28% year to date, while the industry and the S&P 500 have posted a modest gain of 3.7% and 1.7%, respectively. Target has even underperformed the broader Retail and Wholesale sector’s growth of 1.5%. In comparison, peers like Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Costco have posted robust gains of 49.4%, 27%, and 8.3%, respectively..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Closing yesterday’s trading session at $97.37, TGT stands about 41.8% below its 52-week high of $167.40, reached on Aug. 21. The stock also trades well below its 200-day simple moving average of $126.37, signaling continued downward momentum. This technical setup reflects cautious investor sentiment and a lack of near-term catalysts..Target reported lower-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, leading to a substantial cut in full-year guidance. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.30, down from $2.03 in the prior-year period, while total revenues declined 2.8% year over year to $23,846 million. Both figures missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In response, Target revised its full-year outlook, now expecting a low-single-digit sales decline. The adjusted EPS range was also lowered to $7.00-$9.00 from $8.80-$9.80. These revisions reflect ongoing concerns around profitability and demand softness heading into the rest of the fiscal year.Target’s core retail performance is showing signs of strain, particularly within its physical stores, which remain central to its business model. During the first quarter, the company saw a 3.8% decline in comparable sales, driven largely by a 5.7% drop in comparable store sales. While digital channels offered some support with 4.7% growth in comparable digital sales, overall store traffic declined 2.4%, and the average transaction value slipped 1.4%. These trends point to ongoing challenges in sustaining customer engagement and sales momentum across its brick-and-mortar footprint.The company’s gross margin also faced challenges, declining 60 basis points year over year to 28.2% in the first quarter. A key driver of this margin contraction was due to higher markdowns, along with about 80 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain. These challenges could continue as Target grapples with inventory issues and adjusts to slower-than-expected sales, making it difficult to sustain profitable growth in the short term.The retail environment remains uncertain. Target's updated outlook reflects cautious consumer spending, ongoing inflation, and macroeconomic headwinds. Management now expects continued sales pressure through the first half of 2025. While Target is actively cutting costs and optimizing operations, external risks, including tariff shifts, rate volatility, and discretionary spending pullbacks, could further limit recovery potential in the near term.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-stock-trades-bargain-time-140900021.html,market risk

While modest in percentage terms, the hike underscores the retailer’s unwavering commitment to shareholder returns. This marks the 54th consecutive year of annual dividend growth, a streak quite a few S&P 500 companies can match.This also represents the 232nd straight dividend payment since October 1967, highlighting exceptional payout consistency across market cycles, changing economic dynamics and retail disruptions. This is the kind of dependability that many investors seek in an income stock. The dividend will be payable on Sept. 1, 2025 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 13. Target’s first-quarter fiscal 2025 dividend payout totaled $510 million, slightly up from $508 million a year ago. While the company continues to face a competitive retail landscape and shifting consumer behavior, its willingness to increase the dividend signals management’s confidence in ongoing cash generation.Supporting this confidence is Target’s trailing 12-month after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC), which came in at a healthy 15.1% for the period through the first quarter of fiscal 2025. While slightly down from 15.4% a year ago, this still suggests disciplined capital use and consistent profitability. TGT’s dividend payout ratio is currently around 55%.In a market where dividend cuts can suddenly make headlines, Target remains committed to enhancing shareholder value. For investors seeking reliable income from a well-established name, Target is one of them. TGT’s latest move strengthens its reputation as a trustworthy dividend payer with an eye on long-term performance..While Target continues its 54-year streak of dividend growth, Costco Wholesale Corporation COST recently raised its quarterly dividend by a notable 12% from $1.16 to $1.30 per share. This increase highlights Costco’s strong cash flow and disciplined financial management. Costco has consistently appealed to investors seeking income backed by robust fundamentals and market resilience.Lowe’s Companies, Inc. LOW also reaffirmed its shareholder commitment with a 4% dividend hike, bringing its quarterly payout to $1.20.

When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Target's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story..Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Target. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 10%. The second and third largest shareholders are State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 7.7%..After doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company..While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-ownership-target-corporation-nyse-110012460.html,market risk

Bristol Myers Squibb can overcome recent and future patent cliffs thanks to newer approvals.","Target has growth opportunities, particularly in its digital sales business, and boasts an impressive dividend profile..Bristol Myers Squibb can overcome recent and future patent cliffs thanks to newer approvals..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Stocks experienced significant volatility this year, which can sometimes make it challenging to keep a positive outlook. In times like these, it's worthwhile to remember that stock-market swings, even full-blown crashes, are par for the course; they don't change the fact that over the long run, equities generate competitive returns..So it still makes sense to buy shares of companies that can deliver strong performances over five years or more. It's even better if they're trading at a discount, like Target (NYSE: TGT) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). These two top dividend stocks have not performed well this year, but they remain attractive long-term investments..Retail giant Target has had a challenging year. The company's financial results have been subpar, with revenue moving in the wrong direction and guidance weak; investors have responded in kind by selling off the stock. Also not helping matters are uncertainty about the economy, which could negatively impact consumer behavior, and the potential impact of tariffs. There was also a recent national short-term boycott of Target related to management pulling back on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives..Investors should monitor those issues, but there are still bright spots to focus on. Some of Target's troubles are due to economic factors beyond its control. The company can weather the storm. Once it passes, things should improve, especially as it continues to implement critical initiatives that will help it turn the corner..Target recently launched an Enterprise Acceleration Office, led by chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke. It hopes this will help boost productivity and efficiency across the business, notably by implementing tech-based changes..Elsewhere, Target could continue to leverage digital business to drive growth. In the first quarter, Target's net sales decreased to $23.8 billion, a 2.9% decline compared to the year-ago period. Comparable sales decreased 3.8%; however, digital comparable sales rose 4.7%..Target Circle 360 is a paid subscription option launched just last year that is already helping boost the company's digital business. It grants subscribers various perks, including free same-day and two-day shipping.

And if such a company pays a rising dividend that can grow over time, that's a big future passive income opportunity..Currently, skepticism abounds for the following three S&P 500 dividend stocks. But scooping up shares today could pay big dividends -- pun intended -- over the long run..The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are generally some of the strongest, most resilient, and innovative companies around, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is by far the cheapest of the bunch. Shares trade at just around 20 times earnings, not only a discount to peers but even the overall market..And while its dividend is only 0.5%, Alphabet's payout ratio is just 8.9%, leaving huge room for growth. Instead of a bigger dividend, Alphabet is returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases, while also investing in future AI growth..Of course, the reason Alphabet's stock has been under pressure is due to concerns over its main cash cow, Google Search, and the threat posed by AI chatbots..While that is something to monitor, Alphabet has been innovating in AI rapidly, delivering ""AI Overviews"" when users search a topic, which management claims monetizes at the same rate as Search. The company also unveiled ""AI Mode"" in Google Search on May 20, offering the experience of a chatbot within the Search ecosystem..Furthermore, Alphabet has been rapidly catching up to AI chatbot leader OpenAI in large language models (LLMs). When Alphabet's Gemini 2.5 LLM was released on March 25, it immediately rocketed up the developer rankings among top-performing LLMs, seizing the current lead for many applications..Given Alphabet's technical talent and financial resources, I'd expect the company to muddle through this transition. But even if Search growth slows down, there are other AI-related growth opportunities related to Gemini-powered chatbots and agents..Meanwhile, Alphabet has three other large and growing businesses the market appears to be ignoring: YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. YouTube is the the largest streaming company in the world, and growing by double-digits. Google Cloud, while the third-place infrastructure platform, still grew 28% last quarter to a $50 billion annual revenue run-rate, and has been profitable since the first quarter of 2023.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-p-500-dividend-083000955.html,market risk

Target is a financially sound company with a safe dividend..Target has work to do to get the business going, but the stock's cheap valuation and generous dividend yield could pay off for patient investors..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Retail is a competitive and dynamic business, so Target (NYSE: TGT) deserves credit for its generations of steady success. That said, things haven't been rosy lately. The company's sales are in decline, and the stock has plummeted over 60% from its high, its sharpest decline since the 1990s. Things don't get this bad without some mistakes, no doubt. But is Target a dying company?.I don't think so. Target hasn't been an awful investment for several years now, but that's then, and it's time to focus on the future. The company is working through some challenges, but remains fundamentally sound, with reasons for optimism..Here is why investors should consider doubling up on this Dividend King today..Target's sales plateaued and began to decline over the past few years. Consumers behave differently for various reasons, but one major trend is that they have become increasingly financially strained over the past few years, primarily due to rampant inflation..Unique, cool, discretionary merchandise is the foundation of Target's brand..Groceries and household essentials only accounted for 40.5% of total merchandise sales last year. Therefore, when consumers cut back on things they may want but don't need, Target will feel the impact. Tariff uncertainty in recent months has only worsened consumer sentiment, which has plummeted to its lowest level since July 2022..Additionally, Target's decision to walk back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies earlier this year sparked backlash from shoppers who organized a 40-day boycott that began in early March..It leaves Target searching for momentum after the company's merchandise sales dropped 3.1% year over year in Q1 2025, following a 3.2% decline in Q1 2024..Given all that, it's clear why the stock has done so poorly. Still, it's a stretch to say the business is dying..Stagnant, or struggling? Yes, but Target's financial foundation remains sound to this day..Start with a dividend that has ample coverage, despite its 4.4% yield sitting near its all-time high. Target spends a total of $2 billion annually on dividends, but generated over $3.5 billion in free cash flow over the past year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-dividend-stock-double-now-081100361.html,high risk

51,2025-06-13 23:50:00,This Dividend King's Hike Is Bigger Than You Think,"Target boosts its payout to run its streak to 54 years of increases, but that's not the real story here.","Target boosted its dividend by less than 2% this week. The shares are yielding 4.6%..The chain is struggling through a third fiscal year of declining sales, but it can afford to increase its dividend given the reasonable payout ratio..If it continues to lose market share in the coming year, it may want to choose a different deployment path than a dividend hike for its cash flow..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Target (NYSE: TGT) made it official on Thursday. The mass-market retailer lived to keep its Dividend King crown another year. Target boosted its quarterly dividend rate, something that the chain operator has now done for 54 consecutive years..It wasn't much of an increase. The new quarterly distribution rate of $1.14 a share is just a pair of pennies -- or 1.8% -- higher than the old dividend. Target stock has moved exactly 2% higher just through the first four trading days of this week, so its forward yield of 4.6% is just a smidgeon lower than it was when the week started..This is still a pretty big move for Target. Let's zoom in on the retailer's storefront logo to see if it hit the bull's-eye this week..The timing of the payout boost isn't a surprise. As I pointed out earlier this week, Target has announced its annual increase between June 9 and June 15 over the last several years. If it was going to go through with another hike it was going to happen this week..The new rate also isn't a surprise. Target also moved its quarterly dividend two pennies higher last June. Target has the earnings wiggle room to go higher, but it's the wrong message to send when the ""cheap chic"" chain has some issues to figure out. Thursday's move was about checking a box, keeping income investors satisfied until it drums up a way to win back the growth investors that have meandered elsewhere..Target's net sales have declined slightly in back-to-back fiscal years, and this year is off to another challenging start. Comps declined 3.8% in the fiscal first quarter that it posted last month, and it's even worse at the physical store level. Digital comps are 4.7%, fueled by the growing success of Drive Up orders and Target's Circle 360 premium loyalty platform. Inside the actual stores, comps are down 5.7%..Thankfully the chain remains more than profitable to cover the more than $500 million it's shelling out every three months in shareholder distributions. Target's guidance calls for adjusted earnings per share to clock in between $7 and $9 this year. The new dividend will set Target back $4.56 a share, translating into a forward payout ratio of 51% to 65%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-kings-hike-bigger-think-155000632.html,no risk
52,2025-06-13 21:10:00,Target Raises Quarterly Dividend: What It Means for Investors in 2025,TGT boosts its dividend for the 54th straight year as it balances shareholder returns with a cautious 2025.,"Target Corporation TGT has once again demonstrated its commitment to rewarding its shareholders by announcing a 1.8% increase in its quarterly dividend. The retail giant raised its dividend from $1.12 to $1.14 per common share, with the payout scheduled for Sept. 1, 2025, to shareholders of record as of Aug. 13.This marks the company’s 232nd consecutive dividend payment since going public in 1967, underscoring its long-standing track record of financial stability and shareholder returns. With this latest increase, Target is on pace to achieve its 54th consecutive year of annual dividend growth, placing it among the most consistent dividend growers in the retail sector.From a financial standpoint, Target maintains a dividend payout ratio of 55%, a dividend yield of 4.6% and a robust free cash flow yield of 7.8%. Its annual free cash flow return on investment of 9.3% further reinforces the sustainability of the increased dividend..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Beyond dividends, Target is also actively returning capital to its shareholders through buybacks. In first-quarter fiscal 2025, the company repurchased 2.2 million shares worth $251 million. As of quarter-end, it had approximately $8.4 billion remaining under its existing share repurchase program, authorized in August 2021..For income-focused investors and dividend-growth seekers, Target’s consistent payout increases and active capital return strategy reflect a deep commitment to long-term financial performance and shareholder value. In today’s market, where total return matters, dividends and buybacks remain key incentives — TGT is delivering on both fronts..Target began 2025 with a renewed focus on operational efficiency and delivering greater value to customers. The retailer has improved inventory reliability, enhanced fulfillment speeds and invested in store remodels and digital upgrades. Its third-party marketplace, Target Plus, continues to grow, supported by successful brand collaborations like the Kate Spade collection.These efforts reflect Target’s long-term strategy to reinforce its competitive edge. However, recovery remains slower than expected. Discretionary categories such as apparel and home are still under pressure as inflation drives consumers toward essentials. Meanwhile, declining store traffic, cost pressures and weakness in higher-margin segments may weigh on near-term performance. Despite its strong brand equity, loyal customer base and nationwide presence, Target’s recovery is expected to remain gradual through the rest of 2025.Target’s stock is down 26.6% year to date, underperforming its industry’s growth of 4.1%.

In the video above, Kovitz Investment Group portfolio manager John Buckingham explains why investors should be ""embracing volatility."" He also shares five stocks he's interested in now..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here..How should investors be digesting this latest market action and really the volatility that we've seen? .Well, they should be embracing volatility. You know, volatility is the friend of the buyer of long-term value. And, you know, we had this, we have had this massive rebound, um, you know, 20% up. We really did have a bare market intraday, April 7th, April 8th. Um, we did get down more than 20% from the highs. And so, hopefully investors have learned that stocks have proved rewarding over the long haul. They just have to have the patience and discipline to stick with them through thick and thin. .So there's been a lot of talk of diversification, investing overseas, looking out for opportunities. How do you identify those undervalued pockets of the market and where are they within this current environment? .Sure. Well, it's, it's, you know, it's a market of stocks and not simply a stock market. So while, um, the major market averages are now in the black for the year, there are still many stocks that are down. Um, believe it or not, and the average stock in the Russell, uh, uh, 2000, you know, index is down significantly. So, you know, we are a value oriented shop at the Prudent Speculator. We look to buy things that are on sale. Um, you know, try to take advantage of that downside volatility. Things tend to go to extremes. You know, investors get infatuated with certain stocks and then they'll, of course, abandon other companies because sometimes there are short-term issues, um, or they're just not in a space that investors are attracted to today. So today we, you know, we like things in the energy sector because energy stocks have been, been hit pretty hard. You know, a name that I think is attractive is Civitas Resources, probably one of the hardest hit. They're an oil and gas producer. A big dividend yield, um, low PE, they're still very profitable even at current, um, energy price levels and they've been very shareholder friendly in buying back stock and, and paying us a, a giant-sized dividend. Um, also we've seen things like in the pharmaceutical area, a company like Merck, which we view as very high quality. Um, trading at a PE around 11 today with a dividend yield of 4%. And, you know, historically Merck trades for a much higher valuation, uh, level. Uh, happy to go through others if you'd like or we can, uh, I'll wait for, uh, your, your cue. .No, yes, because you have five stocks that you like, you hit two out of the five. So what are some of the other names? .Sure, well, you know, again, um, lots of things have done very well this year. You know, we own Oracle, which has had a great day, uh, today. So when I come on, on the airways, I like to talk about things that haven't had, had their day in the sun. So something like Whirlpool, which is the appliance maker, uh, there your yield is over 7%. Uh, PE is in the 9-10 range and again, we do think that interest rates will be coming down later in the year and that will support, uh, housing and that a stock like Whirlpool, this is the time you want to take advantage of it before all of that has happened. Um, another, uh, stock that has struggled mightily is Target, you know, the big discount retailer. Here again, you have a very low valuation relative to where it historically trades and a dividend yield that's, uh, pushing 5%. And then a final stock would be UPS, which is the package, uh, shipping company. Again, the, the theme here is, is low valuations and generous dividend yields. And in a market where the S&P 500 is, you know, trading at 23 times forward earnings, our portfolios traded at 14 times, uh, forward earnings. And then our dividend yield on our portfolio, overall portfolio is 2.5% versus 1.3% for the, uh, for the S&P 500. So I think you can be selective in this market. I do think that, that stock picking is, is going to be much better going forward than, uh, buying the indexes, um, and it, it certainly helps us sleep better at night with reasonable valuations and generous dividend yields on our stocks.

There are plenty of quality stocks that are still trading a lot lower than they were a year ago..They may not be at their best right now. You don't shed a third of your value in an otherwise buoyant past 12 months without some flaws. However, I think that Target (NYSE: TGT), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), and Freshpet (NASDAQ: FRPT) are three stocks that you might want to consider buying right now..Yes, they are trading at least 33% lower over the past year (and a lot lower than their all-time highs). They still have some compelling reasons to emerge out of the market's penalty box. I am a shareholder in all three companies. Let's take a closer look..It's been a rough few quarters for Target. Shares of the ""cheap chic"" mass-market retailer have gotten even cheaper, but that's largely because the concept itself is no longer chic. Store comps have turned negative, and the chain is coming off back-to-back quarters of declining net sales..The stock has shed a third of its value over the past year, pushing its yield to a beefy 4.6%. That payout could inch higher this week even if the shares stand still, because Target has boosted its dividend for 53 consecutive years. It has announced its hikes between June 9 and 15 in the past several years. If it's going to stretch its Dividend King streak to 54 years, it may very well happen later this week..One can argue that Target has bigger things to worry about than to keep sending more money back to its shareholders. However, it has more than enough wiggle room to dig a little deeper into its pockets. It's currently paying out less than 50% of its trailing earnings in quarterly dividends. Guidance it provided last week calls for adjusted earnings per share between $7 and $9 this year, translating into a payout ratio between 50% and 64%..Target has some work to do to win its customers back. It's a retailer that not only managed to become political -- not typically the best move when you're literally a mass-market concept -- but also somehow angered both sides of the aisle.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-down-33-162409477.html,market risk

Can this membership program outpace Walmart+ and Amazon Prime?","Target Corporation’s TGT digital sales were a bright spot in an otherwise soft first-quarter fiscal 2025, marked by sluggish traffic and a decline in comparable store sales. Digitally originated comparable sales rose 4.7% year over year, reflecting a more than 35% jump in same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360 and continued momentum in Drive Up. Target Circle 360 is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of Target's digital strategy. This membership offers same-day delivery with no price markups, not only on Target's own products but also on orders from more than 100 third-party retailers via Shipt. This commitment to pricing transparency provides Target with a notable competitive advantage in a market where rivals often impose hidden fees or inflate partner prices.Unlike many retail subscription models that are confined to a single brand, Target Circle 360 broadens its appeal by bundling multiple partners, including CVS, Petco, and Lowe’s. In the first quarter, Target successfully fulfilled more than 70% of all digital orders within a day, a significant milestone attributed in part to Shipt’s expanding driver network and retail penetration.In a quarter where overall traffic declined 2.4% and average transaction amount slipped 1.4%, Target Circle 360 stood as a growth catalyst. Target also reported a nearly 20% year-over-year improvement in delivery speed, enhancing convenience at a time when consumers are looking for value and fast delivery.Well, Target’s digital gains came against the backdrop of a cautious consumer spending environment and highlight the growing role Circle 360 plays in offsetting those headwinds..Like Target, Walmart Inc. WMT is leaning heavily into same-day delivery to drive digital growth. Walmart has expanded its Walmart+ membership, which includes free same-day delivery on various merchandise. Walmart’s store footprint, much like Target’s, supports its hybrid fulfillment model, with stores acting as local hubs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Walmart’s global e-commerce sales grew 22%.Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN continues to set the pace in fast fulfillment. With its Prime membership, Amazon offers same-day or one-day delivery on millions of items, leveraging its vast logistics network. Amazon has also aggressively expanded its same-day sites near major cities to cut delivery times further..Target stock has declined 13.7% over the past three months against the industry’s growth of 8.6%. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-digital-sales-4-7-144200265.html,no risk

SFM reported an 11.8% adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 210-basis-point expansion year over year. The strong improvement prompts a key question: Has SFM established a new baseline for profitability?The main reason behind this improvement is Sprouts Farmers’ evolving business model. The company continues to optimize its store footprint by focusing on smaller, more efficient boxes while expanding private-label offerings and high-margin products. Sprouts Brand products contributed 24% of total sales in the first quarter, pointing to a profitable product mix. Operational efficiency is another reason behind the elevated margin. The ongoing transition to self-distribution for fresh meat and seafood has enhanced product control while reducing supply-chain costs. Nearly 80% of stores now operate within 250 miles of a distribution center, supporting tighter inventory management and vendor coordination. These efforts helped push the gross margin up 129 basis points to 39.6% in the first quarter.SFM achieved these gains without resorting to aggressive pricing, maintaining both margin discipline and top-line momentum. The plan to open at least 35 stores in 2025 — each expected to generate $13 million in first-year sales and cash-on-cash returns in the low to mid-thirties by year five — shows that SFM can grow its business without hurting profits.Management’s outlook for EBIT margin expansion supports Sprouts Farmers' EBITDA performance. Undoubtedly, SFM has elevated its financial playbook, and its first-quarter EBITDA margin reflects strategic execution, not a one-off gain..When comparing EBITDA margins, Sprouts Farmers leads the way with 11.8%. Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. GO posted an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.6%, up 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2025. Grocery Outlet’s adjusted EBITDA rose 31.7% to $51.9 million, and it expects full-year adjusted EBITDA between $260 million and $270 million.Target Corporation TGT also saw solid gains, with first-quarter fiscal 2025 EBITDA increasing 11.9% to $2,285 million. Target’s EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points year over year to 9.6%, reflecting improved profitability. Though Target trails Sprouts Farmers on EBITDA margin, it remains ahead of Grocery Outlet..Sprouts Farmers stock has been a standout performer, with shares rallying 30.5% year to date, outpacing the industry’s growth of 17.2%. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sfms-12-ebitda-margin-set-143100436.html,no risk

WMT continues to lead the retail space with its diversified business model, robust omnichannel presence and advanced retail capabilities. These strengths have positioned the company well in an evolving retail landscape. However, Walmart’s current forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.07X raises valuation concerns. This figure is significantly higher than the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry’s average of 33.07X and the S&P 500’s average of 21.96X, making WMT stock appear relatively expensive.When compared to key retail peers, Walmart’s valuation looks even steeper. For instance, The Kroger Co. KR trades at 13.54X, Target Corporation TGT at 12.63X, and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST at 22.14X — all notably lower than Walmart’s multiple. Moreover, WMT holds a Zacks Value Score of C, signaling a limited value appeal at current price levels..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Despite this, investor optimism around Walmart remains robust, thanks to its consistent growth and strong fundamentals. Over the past three months, WMT shares have surged 11.4%, outpacing the industry (+10.7%), the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector (+6.3%), and the S&P 500 (+7.5%). In contrast, Kroger and Target stocks have declined 1.6% and 13.7%, respectively, while Ross Stores gained 10.5% during this time..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Adding to the bullish sentiment, Walmart trades above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating sustained momentum and investor confidence. These technical indicators reinforce the stock's upward trend and price stability.Given these dynamics, investors should weigh Walmart’s strong growth potential against its elevated valuation before making a decision.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Walmart continues to thrive on the back of its robust, diversified business model and consistent performance across segments, geographies, and sales channels. The retail giant is successfully capturing increased customer traffic both in-store and online, highlighting its ability to evolve with the changing dynamics of the global retail industry. With a multi-channel revenue strategy — spanning physical retail, e-commerce, advertising, and memberships — Walmart is building a solid foundation for sustained long-term growth.A core driver of Walmart’s momentum is its powerful omnichannel ecosystem, which seamlessly integrates brick-and-mortar locations with digital capabilities. The company is leveraging data analytics, technology investments, and in-store operational enhancements to deliver a superior customer experience. With the majority of Americans living close to a Walmart store, the retailer can efficiently fulfill online orders through store-based logistics, offering speed and convenience. Retail giants such as Kroger, Target and Ross Stores are also advancing in omnichannel strategies, underscoring the industry’s pivot toward this model.Meanwhile, Walmart has made significant strides in strengthening its e-commerce operations. Strategic acquisitions, tech upgrades, and delivery partnerships have fueled growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, global e-commerce sales surged 22%, led by strong adoption across all business segments. In the United States, e-commerce sales jumped 21%, driven by fast fulfillment, robust marketplace activity, and growing advertising revenues. International e-commerce rose 20%, while Sam’s Club U.S. saw a 27% spike, fueled by growth in club-fulfilled delivery and pickup services.The company also reported impressive comparable sales growth, underpinned by ongoing store upgrades and digital innovations. U.S. comparable sales (excluding fuel) rose 4.5%, with a 1.6% increase in transactions and a 2.8% rise in average ticket size, reflecting strong consumer engagement and value-driven shopping behavior. The grocery segment remained a standout, achieving mid-single-digit comp sales growth and expanding market share.Walmart is now intensifying its focus on high-margin revenue streams, including advertising, membership programs, and marketplace expansion. Key growth engines like Walmart Connect (its advertising platform) and Walmart+ (its subscription-based membership offering) are delivering robust results. In the fiscal first quarter, advertising revenues soared 50%, while membership income climbed 14.8%, showcasing the success of Walmart’s shift toward tech-enabled, margin-accretive services that boost customer loyalty and earnings quality.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-stock-trades-premium-valuation-141000664.html,Market Risk

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$121 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$88.76. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Target's current trading price of US$97.35 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Target’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..Good news, investors! Target is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $161.71, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Target’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.. See our latest analysis for Target .Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -6.3% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Target. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk..Are you a shareholder? Although TGT is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. We recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to TGT, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return..Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TGT for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, we recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision.

This figure, which excludes gasoline price fluctuations and foreign exchange impacts, follows April’s 6.7% and March’s 9.1% gains. While the trend suggests a gradual deceleration, the overall trajectory remains firmly positive.The U.S. market saw a 5.5% comparable sales increase, while Canada and Other International regions delivered 6.3% and 8.4% gains, respectively, excluding gasoline price fluctuations and foreign exchange impacts. These results indicate that Costco’s strength isn’t just domestic but global. Meanwhile, the 12% surge in e-commerce comparable sales further underscores demand across digital channels.The May data confirms Costco’s ability to maintain sales traction at a time when many retailers are grappling with unpredictable consumer behavior. This ongoing momentum, particularly across different geographies and channels, suggests the potential for Costco to finish the final quarter on a decent note.Total company comparable sales, including the effects of gasoline prices and foreign exchange rates, rose 4.3% during May. As a result, Costco's net sales for May increased 6.8% to $20.97 billion, up from $19.64 billion in the same period last year. While May’s results don’t promise a spectacular quarter, they point to good progress so far. If underlying demand holds up, Costco could carry forward the momentum.

Dollar General now expects same-store sales to rise between 1.5% and 2.5% compared to its prior forecast of 1.2% to 2.2%.Target Corporation TGT experienced a 3.8% decline in comparable sales, following a 1.5% increase in the preceding quarter. This drop was attributed to a 5.7% fall in Target’s comparable store sales, which was somewhat offset by a 4.7% increase in comparable digital sales.

WMT is reshaping its growth strategy by doubling down on high-margin revenue streams — namely, advertising, memberships and marketplace expansion. This strategic shift is boosting profitability and reinforcing the company’s leadership in the global retail landscape.In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Walmart saw meaningful gains from its evolving business mix. Higher-margin categories like advertising and memberships were major contributors to profitability. The company’s advertising revenues rallied 50% year over year, fueled in part by its December 2024 acquisition of VIZIO. This move brought VIZIO’s SmartCast Operating System under the Walmart umbrella, enhancing Walmart Connect’s ability to deliver personalized, scalable advertising solutions. Walmart Connect posted 31% growth in the United States, while Sam’s Club advertising grew 21%. Internationally, ad revenues rose 20%, led by strong performance from Flipkart.Membership income also played a vital role. Overall membership fees rose nearly 15% year over year in the fiscal first quarter. Sam’s Club U.S. saw solid gains in member growth, renewal rates and an increase in Plus memberships, driving a 9.6% rise in membership income. Walmart+ delivered double-digit income growth, while Sam’s Club China membership income soared over 40%, driven by rising member adoption. Walmart is also scaling its third major growth pillar: marketplace and store-fulfilled delivery. This integrated ecosystem enhances operational efficiency and supports omnichannel retail engagement.By expanding these high-margin verticals, Walmart is positioning itself for sustainable earnings growth and improved shareholder value in a rapidly evolving retail environment..Some of WMT’s competitors in the retail space are The Kroger Co. KR and Target TGT.The Kroger Co.’s alternative profit businesses, including retail media and health & wellness, continue to contribute to profitability. These businesses generated $1.35 billion in operating profit in fiscal 2024, supported by a 17% increase in retail media revenues. Kroger Precision Marketing (“KPM”) is expanding rapidly, with increasing commitments from agencies, reinforcing its position as a high-margin growth driver. As digital engagement grows, Kroger remains focused on leveraging data-driven insights to enhance advertising effectiveness and drive sustained profitability in this segment.Target is accelerating its shift toward high-margin, non-merchandise revenue streams by scaling digital advertising and marketplace services.

And yet, Costco continues to climb—largely, in my view, due to one key factor: risk perception. Because the company’s business model is so heavily anchored in predictable, recurring revenue from membership fees, its earnings stream is exceptionally stable..That stability arguably justifies the stock’s lofty valuation—and forms the backbone of my bullish thesis, even if there’s little to no margin of safety..I agree with Costco’s critics—those who are skeptical about a warehouse full of assorted goods trading at a forward P/E of 58, a multiple literally higher than tech giant and AI trailblazer Nvidia. For a company like Costco, which has grown revenue at a ~10% CAGR over the past five years and operating income by 15%—yet is only expected by analysts to grow revenue at a 5% CAGR over the next five—it really doesn’t make much sense, at first glance, for the business to trade at such a steep premium..But here’s what a lot of market participants miss when analyzing companies: valuations based on net earnings are heavily anchored to one key factor—risk. And unlike earnings, there’s no single, universally accepted measure of risk. Some investors focus on beta, while others consider regulatory threats or macroeconomic exposure. Ultimately, each investor views the situation through their own lens..That’s where Costco stands out as a rare case: a recurring revenue model outside of the tech sector. Customers pay an annual membership fee—ranging from $60 to $120 in the U.S.—just to shop in its warehouses. Costco likely converts nearly all of that directly into operating profit (though the company doesn’t explicitly disclose this), which allows the business to be highly profitable even while selling goods at razor-thin margins.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-costco-stock-cost-may-182300274.html,market risk

The cheap and chic U.S. retailer has lost some of its cachet as pressured consumers hold off on discretionary purchases, saving their paychecks for the weekly Costco Wholesale run or other essentials shopping..But there's still a lot to love about Target. Let's see where it is today and where it might be in a year from now..Target was on top of the world when its digital channels took off early in the pandemic, but it's slipped since then as it deals with one challenge after another. Most of its woes center around its business model as a hub for discount discretionary shopping, with a focus on apparel and home improvement. That's in contrast to retailers like Walmart and Costco, which are usually described as Target's competitors but actually are different in their focus on grocery and essentials..Target is still a huge force in U.S. shopping, with nearly 2,000 stores and $106 billion in trailing-12-month sales. But it's barely growing or reporting declines, souring investor sentiment..In the fiscal 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended May 3), sales dropped 2.8% from last year, with comparable sales (comps) down 3.8%. The bright spot continues to be digital. Digital comps were up 4.7% from last year, driven by a 35% increase in same-day delivery, powered by the company's membership program. Loyal customers are counting on Target for speed and convenience, which should give investors some confidence in the chance for the comeback..It doesn't look like things are going to get much easier for Target in the near future, and investors shouldn't expect a huge rebound over the next 12 months. There's still talk of stubborn inflation and a recession, stagflation, and whatever other way economists are describing current macroeconomic conditions. On top of that, Target has faced challenges for its political positions, and the challenges are further eroding consumer and investor confidence..There's also the tariff issue, which continues to change and remains uncertain.

The company reported about 120 basis points of gross margin benefit from reduced shrink, a notable reversal of the elevated losses seen during 2022 and 2023. This improvement helped offset pressures from higher markdowns and digital fulfillment costs.The company clawed back most of the 120 basis points of shrink-related headwinds accumulated over prior years, with CFO Jim Lee noting the quarter included a “catch-up” component. This shrink improvement pushed operating income 13.6% higher year over year despite a 2.8% drop in net sales, underlining just how pivotal the benefit was. Management conceded that the bulk of the shrink recovery may have now played out, and the path forward may not provide the same level of margin uplift in subsequent quarters.Shrink improvements have proven vital to cushioning against broader margin pressure, especially as comparable sales decline and discretionary demand remains weak. However, the sustainability of this benefit is limited. With ongoing margin pressures from digital fulfillment costs, tariff uncertainties and soft traffic, the durability of Target’s profitability hinges on more than shrink. Target will need to rely on other levers, such as merchandising mix, cost efficiencies or pricing strategies, to maintain or expand margins..Dollar General Corporation DG continues to battle shrink-related challenges, though recent progress shows signs of traction. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Dollar General reported a 61-basis-point improvement in shrink, contributing to a 78-basis-point increase in the gross margin. While gains are encouraging, Dollar General acknowledged persistent cost pressures elsewhere. Still, shrink mitigation remains a crucial lever for Dollar General as it works to stabilize margins in a volatile consumer environment.Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA is also leaning on shrink reduction to help protect margins in a tough retail environment. In the latest quarter, Ulta Beauty’s gross margin dipped slightly to 39.1% from 39.2% a year ago, with lower shrink partially offsetting pressure from fixed costs and weaker other revenues.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Target is expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.3%..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.62 points to a change of -14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -15.7%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 indicates a change of +7.6% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -14.3%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Target.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-tgt-trending-stock-130014952.html,no risk

RH's earnings outlook has been clouded by the looming impact of tariffs on its imported high-end home furnishings.  As of this writing, shares of Target (NYSE: TGT) are down 31% year to date amid disappointing sales.","Target is struggling with weak sales, sending its shares sharply lower in 2025..RH's earnings outlook has been clouded by the looming impact of tariffs on its imported high-end home furnishings..One of these retail stocks may be poised to rebound in the second half of the year..10 stocks we like better than RH ›.It's a matchup between two consumer goods retailers navigating a turbulent economic landscape. As of this writing, shares of Target (NYSE: TGT) are down 31% year to date amid disappointing sales. RH (NYSE: RH) stock has also missed the mark, falling 58% in 2025, facing concerns that its supply chain of imported high-end furniture and subsequent earnings outlook is exposed to new U.S. trade tariffs..Despite headwinds, Target and RH remain industry leaders, offering reasons for investor optimism about a potential turnaround. Could their recent stock price declines present a compelling buy-the-dip opportunity?.Let's explore whether Target or RH is the best stock to buy now..Target stands out among its discount retail industry competitors, such as Walmart or Dollar General, by offering a more elevated in-store shopping experience. The retailer blends affordability with a curated assortment of merchandise, including a growing portfolio of private-label brands, attracting a loyal customer base..On the other hand, Target is facing a historically challenging period into 2025, with core shoppers cutting discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty. In the first quarter (ended April 30), net sales declined by 2.8% year over year, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 marked a 36% decline from last year, and missed the consensus Wall Street estimate of $1.61. Management cited soft in-store demand and some early tariff-related cost pressures..The headline numbers lack confidence, but investors should focus on the bigger picture. Target has been ramping up promotional efforts with a shifting sales mix, offering lower-price point items to appeal to more value-conscious shoppers and drive store traffic. The company's digital strategy has been a bright spot, with e-commerce sales growing 4.7% from the prior-year quarter..Even with Target guiding for a low-single-digit decline in net sales this year, the business remains profitable, with a 2025 adjusted EPS target between $7 and $9. That's great news for investors thinking about the sustainability of Target's $1.12-per-share quarterly dividend, now yielding 4.8%, which is further supported by a solid balance sheet.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-target-092500866.html,- Market Risk   - Credit Risk   - Operational Risk   - Liquidity Risk

But even with the high payout, Target has lost investors money over the last five years while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has more than doubled with dividends included..Here's why Target is under pressure, and whether the dividend stock is a buy right now..Retailers like Target have been under pressure as consumers tighten spending amid inflation and economic uncertainty. Data from the University of Michigan shows that consumer sentiment is hovering around its lowest level since 2022. Some companies have capitalized on consumer needs by providing products and services consumers want at affordable prices..For example, Walmart and Costco Wholesale have steadily grown revenue while sustaining good margins despite macro challenges. Target has had some success with promotions and partnerships, but is still seeing an overall decline in foot traffic..The divergence between Target's stock price and Walmart's and Costco's over the last two to three years illustrates the degree to which investor confidence has weakened for Target relative to these other names..Target slashed its guidance in its most recent earnings announcement. The company is now on track for a third consecutive fiscal year of adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) declines. With Target's sales and earnings falling, investors have understandably grown skeptical of the company's ability to execute. Target has built up a bad track record of overpromising and underdelivering, so it's hard to put too much faith in its guidance..To Target's credit, management acknowledged the poor results and is focusing on turning the business around rather than appeasing investors. The company plans to leverage efficiency improvements and a revamped product lineup to get customers in stores and return to meaningful sales growth. Target has the tools to pull it off, but the retailer has to manage costs better, align inventory with buyer behavior trends, and limit steep discounts that have crushed its margins in recent years..Target's flaws are glaring and ongoing, but it would be a mistake to overlook the qualities that could make the stock a good buy in June.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-1-000-tgt-today-081500924.html,market risk   dividend risk   consumer demand risk

This time, it’s capable of outputting 4K resolution and more impactful HDR video to your TV screen..For now, Mario Kart World and enhanced versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are the best visual showcases of what the Switch 2 is capable of, along with third-party launch titles like Cyberpunk 2077. The improved graphical fidelity and higher frame rates, made possible by the Switch 2’s Nvidia Corp.-made processor, are easily noticeable once you’ve started up a game..When it comes to performance, Nintendo’s console still lags behind Sony Group Corp.’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox Series X, both heavier-duty systems designed to be used exclusively in the home. But for Nintendo fans, the in-game worlds of beloved characters like Mario and Link have never looked better..Unboxing the device will be a familiar experience to owners of the original Switch, and that feeling remains true as you begin using it. The significantly larger 7.9-inch display is much easier on the eyes — a blessing for the eyesight of anyone who’s grown up alongside Nintendo’s gadgets — and has a sharper 1080p resolution..It’s also far more fluid than the screen on the original version; this model supports a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes Mario Kart World feel all the more chaotic (in a fun way). These upgrades help offset the fact that the Switch 2 uses an LCD display instead of a punchier OLED panel..The upsized screen means you’re also getting bigger Joy-Con controllers, which makes handheld mode a far more ergonomic experience.

The facility had been accumulating at a 1% interest rate until April, when it switched to a floating-rate structure equal to about two percentage points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate..That would amount to about 6.4% today, according to Matt Woodruff, head of transportation and aerospace research at CreditSights.

Joining us now, we've got Mark Matthews, who's the National Retail Federation Executive Director of Research. Good to have you back on the program with us. How are you viewing the retail landscape right now and and the pulse that you're hearing from some of the executives in the face of some of the uncertainty that they're citing when they report earnings? .Yeah, it's a great question. It's a really challenging environment right now, uh, just trying to understand what the consumer is doing and how the consumer is behaving. In January and February, we saw, uh, strong disposable income, we saw strong, uh, you know, consumer finances, but sentimentally, consumers have been weak. Uh, you know, as we all know, sentiment is is very low. Uh, and we definitely saw some fallback, fall off in spending in in January and February. Uh, however, we saw the opposite in in March and April, uh, as we saw consumers pull purchases forward because they were worried about tariffs. And and right now, I guess the big question for everybody is, you know, what's going to happen next? Uh, you know, some of those pulled forward purchases represent lost future sales, uh, and we still have a very uncertain consumer. Uh, so the the the challenge becomes understanding where they're headed. And right now, as we see, consumers are are are uncertain, they're concerned, and it looks like, you know, we we see a lot of trading down. You know, consumers are looking for value for the for their dollar. .Yeah, they certainly are, Mark. It makes me wonder, too, which retailers are best positioned to win in that particular environment. What do you think is the winning strategy for retailers to navigate tariff policy? .Yeah, I think we saw something pretty similar in in 2022 when we had high inflation. When the consumer is out there looking for the best price, uh, you want to be a retailer that is offering the best price. Uh, you want your consumer to believe that, uh, they're getting value for their dollars. So I think that's a challenge for everybody, and uncertain consumer means that they're going to be much more careful with, uh, with their money.

This news plays a role in the company's share price performance, which saw a 1% decline last week. Despite these legal issues, it's important to note that the broader market remained flat over the same period. While the lawsuit may have added some downward pressure on Target's stock, the overall market stability suggests that the company's legal troubles did not lead to a dramatic deviation from general market trends..We've identified 3 warning signs with Target (at least 1 which is concerning) and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process..We've found 20 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free..The recent legal challenges faced by Target, including the class action lawsuit, could potentially impact the company's efforts to enhance customer experience and drive revenue growth. While the short-term impact on the share price was a 1% decline, over a five-year period, Target’s total return, including dividends, was a 10.13% decline. This paints a broader picture of the company's struggle to outperform, especially when considering its underperformance against both the US Consumer Retailing industry and the US market over the past year, where the industry saw a 31.5% return and the market a 12.6% return..Considering the revenue and earnings forecasts, Target's growth ambitions through store enhancements and digital expansion might face hurdles if the lawsuit results in operational or financial setbacks. The legal proceedings could also influence analysts' outlooks on the expected revenue of US$113.3 billion and earnings of US$4.6 billion by May 2028. This situation could further impact the fair value assessment, especially given the current share price of US$93.65, which is noticeably lower than the consensus price target of US$127.78—a 26.7% potential increase.

Our proven model predicts that an earnings beat is likely for Dollar General this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dollar General has an Earnings ESP of +2.64% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..Dollar General’s strategic push to grow its market share in the consumables and non-consumables categories underscores its competitive pricing and strong value proposition, which resonate well with budget-conscious consumers. Proactive pricing strategies, targeted promotions and the ongoing expansion of private-label offerings are expected to have supported top-line growth.We remain optimistic about several key initiatives, including DG Fresh, SKU rationalization, digitization and the expansion of the private fleet, which are likely to have contributed to improvements in same-store sales. The company’s “back-to-basics” approach has helped reinforce operational discipline, while efforts to reduce shrinkage are already delivering measurable gains. For the quarter under review, we project a 0.8% increase in same-store sales.The same-day delivery pilot program is expected to have driven incremental sales by providing additional convenience for shoppers. Furthermore, the company’s partnership with DoorDash is likely to have helped capture digital sales. These factors, combined with increased foot traffic, are expected to have boosted revenues in the quarter.Despite these strategic moves, Dollar General guided a challenging first half of fiscal 2025 due to upfront costs associated with remodeling projects and increased labor-related expenses. Management projected earnings per share (EPS) to decline on a year-over-year basis during this period. We expect SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, to deleverage 90 basis points. As a result, we foresee an operating margin contraction of 70 basis points.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-hold-sell-dollar-general-151500942.html,market risk   operational risk

83,2025-06-02 17:24:00,What went wrong at Target?,"The mass merchant is looking to turn around falling sales and declining customer sentiment. But first, it needs to diagnose its own problems.","This story was originally published on Retail Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter. .It’s been a tough few months for Target..Or at least that's how CEO Brian Cornell described it in an email to employees in early May. In the email, which Target shared with Retail Dive, Cornell recognized that silence from leadership had “created uncertainty,” but added reassurance that “we are still the Target you know and believe in—a company that welcomes all and aims to bring joy to everyone, every day.”.But is it? Some consumers aren’t so sure anymore and analysts would argue that Target’s tough period started far before this year. .Target is not standing still in the face of its challenges. The retailer announced a slew of new brands or offerings over the past few months, met with some well-known activists to discuss its DEI changes, launched a strategic refocusing initiative and switched up its executive team. .Still, analysts seem doubtful of how quickly the business can be turned around. Plus, the work comes at the same time as major changes in U.S. trade policy that have upended retail planning and inserted more uncertainty into the industry. .Target has a plan. But is it too little, too late?.The company has certainly earned its keep as one of the nation’s most successful retailers in the past few decades. In tough times, it thrived. Target in 2020 recorded $15 billion of sales growth, which was higher than its total sales growth over the previous 11 years, thanks in part to staying open for wary shoppers looking to consolidate purchases..The retailer was thriving compared to others in apparel at the time, a category (along with home goods) where Target had invested heavily in private labels in the years prior. At the same time, Target was undergoing large-scale store revamps, investing in digital capabilities such as drive-up delivery and creating new shopping experiences like Ulta Beauty at Target..From 2019 to 2020, Target saw its full-year sales increase nearly 20% year over year, along with a 19.8% increase in total revenue and a 40% jump in operating income. Cornell attributed much of this success to the company’s multicategory assortment mix and its various fulfillment options. For 2021, the retailer reported double-digit growth in all the same metrics. .By 2022, though, Target’s growth was slowing. And now, the company is facing not just sales declines, but also consumer backlash, a temporary pause on its Ulta shop-in-shops and a poorly positioned assortment for the current macroenvironment. Its Q1 earnings this month were a disappointment, and while that’s partly due to tariffs and consumer backlash, it’s also the result of longstanding issues.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/went-wrong-target-092400793.html,Operational Risk   Strategic Risk   Reputational Risk

Recent headwinds in the economy have weighed on sales of leading retail and consumer goods brands, and this has driven their stocks down and their yields higher..While the near term could be rocky, investors who buy the following dividend stocks today could build up a rewarding stream of passive income for years to come. Here's why three Fool.com contributors believe Target (NYSE: TGT), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) are great dividend stocks to buy and hold for the next 20 years..Jennifer Saibil (Target): Target is a great example of a company that's rebounded from challenges and gone on to soaring heights. It's in the dumps right now, but it's been there before. In fact, it was struggling right before the pandemic, and it invested in a robust omnichannel strategy before it was fashionable and just in time to benefit from a huge acceleration in e-commerce. Throughout its current struggles, its digital channels, including same-day and pickup services, continue to enjoy strong growth. That should give investors some confidence that it can rebound again under better conditions..There are several reasons Target is under pressure today. Grocery, which as a category does well under most conditions, isn't as large a segment for Target as it is for some of its competitors. As customers have pulled back on discretionary purchases due to inflation, sales growth has been slow or non-existent, and it's had to mark down items to get them off shelves, cutting into its margins. It's been the target (no pun intended) of several politically based consumer boycott efforts, which cut into recent sales, and all of these things have led to reduced consumer confidence in Target. Now there's the looming threat of tariffs, which had some impact on Target's business in the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended May 3), and are creating uncertainty about the near future..Comparable sales dropped 3.8% from last year in the first quarter, although operating income increased 13.6%. Same-day delivery increased 35% year over year, driving a 4.7% increase in comparable digital sales.

Courts are weighing in on whether these tariffs can stay in effect..“We are basing our decisions really based on what we know” and what’s in place at the moment, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said in an interview, adding that Costco hasn’t made changes in response to court orders this week as tariffs are still in effect. “It’s difficult to make decisions on items that we just don’t know what the outcome will be.”.At Costco, price increases are expected to hit later in the year as the company starts to sell new inventory. It won’t be a “one-size-fits-all” scenario, Millerchip said. The retailer is likely to hold prices of some items steady and raise others. Costco may stop selling certain products if they become too expensive, and timing will also vary for items..In addition to working with suppliers, Costco is rerouting goods sourced from countries with high tariffs to other markets, Chief Executive Officer Ron Vachris said on a call with analysts Thursday.

As interest rates rose in 2022, investors appear to have dumped Target's stock in favor of Walmart.","One of Walmart's biggest rivals, Target, isn't looking so big anymore and is just a fraction of its size..Walmart has typically been more valuable than Target, but the gap has widened significantly..As interest rates rose in 2022, investors appear to have dumped Target's stock in favor of Walmart..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is one of the most valuable companies in the world, approaching $800 billion in market value. It looks on track to become the first retailer to hit the $1 trillion mark. In just the past three years, it has risen by more than 130%..But what about one of its key rivals, Target (NYSE: TGT)? It has been going in the opposite direction lately. And the divergence has become so significant that it is worth just $43 billion, close to 5% of Walmart's overall valuation..Here's a look at how big the gap between these two stocks used to be, why it has changed drastically, and what it could mean for investors..If you look at the returns of these two retail stocks over the past 10 years, you can see that Walmart has clearly been the better buy -- but not always. It wasn't until 2022 with rising interest rates and a slowdown in consumer spending that the tide turned. Up until then, Target was looking like the better buy..However, as consumers put the brakes on discretionary spending, and with Target being more dependent on discretionary purchases, that led investors to pivot away from Target and load up on Walmart's stock..Walmart's business is more heavily tilted toward groceries. They account for close to 60% of the company's revenue, versus closer to 20% for Target. And so it has been better positioned to do well amid a challenging economy. Its results have been better, and investors have also been more optimistic about its growth..Walmart is the safer buy, and Target is certainly riskier, but the big question right now is whether there's too much bullishness around Walmart and too much bearishness on Target. The chart below shows the ratio of Walmart's valuation in relation to Target's over the years..Prior to that divergence that has taken place since 2022, Walmart was around three times more valuable than Target. Now, it's 18 times more valuable, with Walmart stock trading at 41 times its trailing earnings while Target trades at a multiple of just 10..Target has been performing poorly of late, and it recently missed expectations again in its latest quarterly results. Times are tough for the retailer, and the risk of tariffs only exacerbates concerns about its future.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/absurdly-cheap-retail-stock-shrunk-121500784.html,market risk   liquidity risk

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period..Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether..We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free..Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman of the Board & CEO, Brian Cornell, for US$7.1m worth of shares, at about US$159 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$94.87. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels..In the last year Target insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!. Check out our latest analysis for Target .If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar)..The last three months saw significant insider selling at Target. Specifically, insiders ditched US$5.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain..I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$75m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment..Insiders haven't bought Target stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Target makes money, and is growing profits. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Target (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-insiders-sold-us-21m-110016105.html,Market Risk   Corporate Governance Risk

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TGT. Target Corporation (TGT)'s share was trading at $94.29 as of 23rd May. TGT’s trailing and forward P/E were 10.36 and 11.96 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com.Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) reported first-quarter 2025 results that reflect a difficult retail environment marked by a 2.8% decline in net sales to $23.8 billion and a 3.8% drop in comparable sales, with store sales down 5.7% and traffic declining 2.4%. While digital sales grew 4.7%, and same-day services surged, these gains were not enough to offset macroeconomic headwinds like inflation, tariff pressures, and cautious consumer spending. Adjusted EPS fell to $1.30 from $2.03, missing expectations, while gross margins contracted due to markdowns and digital fulfillment costs..However, improved shrink helped offset some margin pressure. Despite near-term weakness, Target maintained strong capital deployment, repurchasing $251 million in shares and paying $510 million in dividends. The company lowered its full-year EPS guidance to $7.00–$9.00 and expects capital expenditure near the low end of $4–$5 billion. Target gained market share in 15 of 35 tracked categories, with strength in essentials, apparel, and seasonal goods, aided by standout campaigns like the Kate Spade collaboration. Its positioning on value and curated offerings kept it competitive with peers such as Walmart and Amazon..Geopolitical and tariff risks remain a concern, but Target is aggressively diversifying sourcing and holding prices steady. Omnichannel investments continue to pay off, with stores fulfilling 96% of sales and fulfillment speeds improving. Inventory was elevated but is expected to normalize by year-end. Though Q1 disappointed and guidance was cut, Target’s digital momentum, cost control, and long-term strategy offer a foundation for recovery and long-term investor appeal..Previously, we have covered Target Corporation (TGT) in April 2025 wherein we summarized a bearish thesis by maparo on wallstreetbets subreddit page. The author highlighted that the company faced multiple challenges, including declining consumer spending, weakening foot traffic, and a stagnant financial outlook with slipping sales and earnings. Critics argued that Target’s pricing and brand positioning had eroded, leaving it vulnerable to competition from Walmart, Amazon, and Costco, while looming tariff pressures threatened to further squeeze margins. Overall, the analysis warned of a structural decline and recommended bearish trades due to the risk of further stock price weakness. Since our last coverage, the stock is up 2.32%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-tgt-bull-case-052137336.html,no risk

Let’s take a closer look at how each presently stacks up..Weak quarterly results, stemming from soft demand for its products, have been a major thorn in NKE’s side, with the initial China tariff announcements early in the year causing a meltdown..However, shares have rebounded nicely from their 2025 lows following the recent de-escalation announcement, rising 9% over the past month and outperforming the S&P 500..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The tariff situation remains cloudy, given that the de-escalation is currently in place for 90 days, but it nevertheless represents a step in the right direction concerning a potential permanent deal. .Most apparel names got hammered on the initial tariff announcements due to their heavy manufacturing exposure, with investors recalculating their profitability outlooks in a big way..The earnings outlook for its current fiscal year has been overall negative but has begun shifting positively, as shown below. Still, investors would likely be better off staying on the sidelines until further clarification is provided regarding the tariff issue, which will result in a much more stable EPS outlook overall..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.TGT shares have continued to struggle in 2025, down nearly 30% and widely underperforming not only the S&P 500 but also many other peer retailers. Quarterly results have regularly brought post-earnings pressure over recent periods, with the company’s more ‘discretionary’ inventory being a major thorn in the side over the last several years overall..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Target’s product mix is much less exposed to the grocery side relative to Walmart, for example, carrying a much less ‘staply’ nature. The company benefited massively during the pandemic era, when consumers were rapidly spending on discretionary items, but that theme has long subsided..The less-than-ideal inventory mix has been the primary driver behind the stock’s decline over recent years. Its recent set of quarterly results also didn’t deliver shareholders the break they were looking for, with comparable store sales declining 5.7% YoY throughout its latest period..As shown below, sales growth has remained muted..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Bottom Line.Both stocks above – NIKE NKE and Target TGT – have faced big pressure over recent years, well off all-time highs.

An unspecified number of items under the collab will have a starting price of $2.99 for a limited time, according to the retailer. The items will be sold in stores and online starting June 1. .Scott, who grew up in South Carolina, has “perfected the art of whole-hog BBQ” and brings a positive attitude, Target said.  .Target launched its first Good & Gather Collabs earlier this year with fellow James Beard Award-winning chef and restaurateur Ann Kim.

The sell-off is brutal, considering shares of the retail giant fell 9.3% between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024 -- a two-year period in which the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained 53.2%..But value investors looking at Target's 53 consecutive years of dividend raises and 4.7% yield may be wondering if the Dividend King stock is worth buying on the dip..Let's dive into Target's latest earnings report to see if management has a clear direction for turning the company around and if Target stock is worth buying now..Target's latest earnings (first-quarter fiscal 2025) weren't great. But its full-year forecast is an even bigger concern, as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be just $7 to $9. Unless results come in at the high end of that range, Target will likely notch yet another year of negative earnings and net sales growth..Target's weak results mainly stem from low foot traffic and inventory mismanagement. One of the greatest challenges for retailers is predicting buyer behavior trends. It's hard enough to know what products customers will buy, but it's even more difficult to forecast how much they will want. Over-ordering sets the stage for discounts and lower profitability, whereas under-ordering can leave sales on the table..Since 96% of Target's net sales volume is fulfilled by its stores, Target has to manage inventory levels to account for in-store purchases and online orders. Digital sales have been a bright spot for Target, with comparable digital sales up 4.7% and average click-to-deliver speeds nearly 20% faster than last year. More than 70% of all first-quarter digital orders were fulfilled within one day. These numbers sound great on paper, but supporting a growing digital sales funnel comes with costs and pressures on inventory management..In its latest quarter, inventory jumped 11% compared to first-quarter fiscal 2024 due to lower-than-expected sales -- which directly impacted Target's bottom line..On its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Target shared strategies for turning the business around, including offering more than 10,000 new items starting at just $1, leaning into holiday seasons (which have historically been Target's bread and butter), and the formation of a new enterprise called Acceleration Office. Acceleration Office will focus on enabling technology, artificial intelligence, and other tools to make Target more efficient, cost-effective, and agile. A key part of the project is modernizing and streamlining inventory management, which could help Target save a significant amount of money and better forecast buyer behavior trends. It sounds great on paper, but investors have heard bold plans from Target in the past that didn't translate to bottom-line results.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-30-2025-dividend-king-011300876.html,- **Market Risk**   - **Operational Risk**   - **Reputational Risk**   - **Liquidity Risk**

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Shopify SHOP, Zoom Communications ZM and Peloton Interactive PTON..Here is a synopsis of all five stocks..Safran, a global aerospace and defense technology leader based in France, stands out as a rare long-term outperformer in the European equities landscape. The company specializes in aircraft propulsion, equipment, and defense systems, boasting strong competitive advantages through its technological expertise, deep relationships with global aerospace manufacturers, and exposure to high-barrier-to-entry markets. Safran’s durable business model is backed by significant aftermarket services revenue, which provides a steady and recurring cash flow base..This year, the stock has surged 33%, handily outperforming both the broader European indices and US benchmarks. Its ascent is supported by two powerful macro tailwinds: the migration out of US dollar-denominated assets and renewed investor interest in European defense names, especially in light of shifting geopolitical priorities across the EU..What’s more, Safran’s long-term track record is equally impressive. Over the past decade, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 15.1%, consistently outperforming major global benchmarks, even as European equities as a whole have struggled to keep pace with their U.S. counterparts..With strong price momentum, secular defense tailwinds, and a Top Zacks Rank to back it up, Safran is positioned as a very compelling investment opportunity going forward..As European defense budgets continue to surge, it's no surprise that analysts are taking a more bullish stance on key players in the region and Safran is at the top of that list. The company is widely viewed as a strategic beneficiary of the EU’s renewed commitment to defense modernization and autonomy, particularly amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and shifting NATO dynamics..Reflecting this favorable outlook, analysts have been steadily raising their earnings forecasts. Over the past 30 days, consensus estimates for Safran’s current-year earnings have climbed by 5.45%, while projections for 2026 have increased by 4.87%. These upward revisions give Safran it Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, signaling improving earnings momentum and growing confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on structural tailwinds in aerospace and defense.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/safran-target-highlighted-zacks-bull-122400038.html,Market risk

But as I'm using them, the difference has everything to do with the future. Well-know retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) trades at just 11 times its earnings, which is about 60% cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at about 28 times earnings, according to YCharts. But it's not a good idea to invest in a stock simply because it looks cheap. If Target's profits drop further, this cheap stock likely isn't a bargain..In other words, Target stock is ""cheap"" when compared to the valuation of the S&P 500, meaning it's merely less expensive right now. By contrast, the term ""bargain"" causes me to consider the quality of the business, not just the price. But it's precisely the quality of Target's business that's in question right now..Consider that Target's revenue peaked about two years ago, and management expects another low-single-digit decline here in 2025. Moreover, its earnings per share (EPS) peaked three years ago. And this year, management is guiding for EPS of $8 to $10, which is a wide range, reflecting a lot of uncertainty with the business..The situation is complicated yet my assertion is simple: If Target materially grows its earnings in coming years, then the current price is a bargain. Consider that it looks cheap today based on the currently suppressed earnings. Therefore, things would get quite interesting if earnings went up from here. And believe it or not, Target has low-hanging fruit to increase profitability and most investors don't even know about it..The largest brick-and-mortar retail chain in the world is Walmart (NYSE: WMT) -- everyone knows that it sells physical products in physical stores. What investors might not know is that Walmart has a growing digital business that's boosting its profitability..Walmart's digital business has multiple components. It has an e-commerce website, which enables high-margin third-party sales in addition to first-party sales. It sells memberships to its subscription product Walmart+. And it leverages this digital scale into a skyrocketing advertising business..In the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, for example, revenue for Walmart's advertising business jumped 50% year over year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-stock-looks-cheap-may-091400347.html,market risk   financial risk   valuation risk

Unfortunately for investors, Target is hovering around the low end of that range at about $95 per share at the time of this writing..The sell-off in Target stock, paired with decades of dividend raises, has pushed Target's dividend yield up to a hefty 4.7%. Here's why Target is a dividend stock worth doubling up on in May, even though its challenges are far from over..On its latest earnings call, Target blamed weakening consumer confidence and tariffs on top of an extended period of inflation as reasons for its poor results. Target's first-quarter net sales were down 2.8% due to lower traffic. Target held or gained market share in 15 out of its 35 merchandising divisions. However, its goal is to grow market share across the majority of its assortment. On its first-quarter earnings call, Target said it was not satisfied with its first-quarter performance..Target CEO Brian Cornell said the following in Target's earnings press release:.While our sales fell short of our expectations, we saw several bright spots in the quarter, including healthy digital growth, led by a 36% increase in same-day delivery through Target Circle 360, and our strongest designer collaboration in more than a decade, Kate Spade for Target. While these highlights reinforce our confidence in the underlying health of our business, we're not satisfied with current performance and know we have opportunities to deliver faster progress on our roadmap for growth..Although Target expressed accountability for the poor results and a plan for returning to growth, the company's updated guidance indicates the pain is far from over. Less than three months ago, Target forecast fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.80, net sales growth of around 1%, and a modest increase in operating margins compared to fiscal 2024. Now, Target is guiding for just $7 to $9 in fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS and a low single-digit decline in sales..What makes Target's significant guidedown even worse is that Target is coming off fairly weak comps in fiscal 2024 -- a year in which it grew comparable sales by just 0.1%, traffic by 1.4%, and booked $8.86 in adjusted EPS compared to $8.94 in fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dirt-cheap-dividend-king-stock-070800714.html,market risk

It was a move to better capitalize on Jupiter’s core value proposition, which is focused on dandruff..“When people have problems, they need solutions,” Salter said. “We’re big believers that Target is the right home for us at this stage in our evolution. Early signs are strong, but our goal here is to go big.”.The brand’s products boast high retention rates, Goodhart said, and is going to be casting a wider net in terms of marketing as well as distribution. “We’ve really effectively taken the bottom and lower-middle funnel approach to customer acquisition,” he said. “With this capital, we’re able to build brand awareness now that we’ve established product market fit. Target, beyond it being a sales channel, is also a marketing channel.”.The products sit on the upper end of the price bracket for the mass market — its medicated shampoo, for example, retails for $25 on the brand’s website and $15 at Target — which Salter attributed to the formula..“This isn’t just for the Bergdorf Goodman customer anymore. We wanted to make this product as accessible as physically possible while still maintaining the quality of the ingredients,” he said. “We’re never going to be as inexpensive as some of the other brands that are out there because higher quality ingredients cost money. But we want to bring this to the masses, and we’ve lowered our prices considerably.”.On the True Beauty Ventures side — the firm was an early backer of K18 and currently counts Crown Affair in its portfolio — the brand’s problem-solution ethos resonated..“One of the benefits of beauty is that it’s a very emotional category, and when you think about the stigma around dandruff, it’s a real stigma,” said Cristina Nuñez, the firm’s cofounder. “You can display this product very prominently in your shower.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/true-beauty-ventures-invests-jupiter-040100153.html,no risk

Walmart is doubling down on its strengths in grocery, logistics, and tech-enabled efficiency, while Target is focused on recovering from past margin pressure through tighter inventory management and improved merchandising. For investors comparing WMT vs. TGT stock today, the decision comes down to which company offers the better mix of stability, growth potential, and value in a rapidly evolving retail landscape..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Walmart continues to thrive, fueled by the strength of its highly diversified business model and consistent contributions across segments, markets, and sales channels. The company is effectively capturing increased traffic both in-store and online, underscoring its ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving retail landscape. Its multi-channel revenue approach — spanning physical stores, e-commerce, advertising and memberships — provides a strong, resilient foundation for long-term growth. High-margin initiatives like Walmart Connect, the company’s advertising platform, and Walmart+, its subscription-based membership program, are becoming key profit engines. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, advertising revenues soared 50%, while membership income grew by 14.8%, showcasing Walmart’s successful pivot toward tech-enabled, higher-margin services that enhance both profitability and customer loyalty.A cornerstone of Walmart’s success lies in its robust omnichannel strategy. The company has made significant investments in data analytics, store operations, and digital expansion to deliver a seamless shopping experience across platforms. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Walmart’s global e-commerce sales climbed 22%, fueled by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery services. Supporting this momentum is its optimized last-mile delivery infrastructure, which is on track to provide same-day delivery to 95% of U.S. households, further strengthening its competitive edge in the fast-paced retail environment.While Walmart is off to a strong start in 2025, the company has flagged potential headwinds in the coming quarters — most notably from tariffs and broader economic uncertainty. Even at reduced levels, tariff-related costs could lead to modest price increases in the near term. Additionally, currency fluctuations may pose challenges to international operations. However, Walmart’s expanding e-commerce footprint, strong everyday value proposition and continued growth in high-margin segments like advertising and memberships provide a solid cushion against near-term volatility.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-vs-target-retail-giant-154600843.html,Market Risk   Competitive Risk   Operational Risk

Analyst price target for TGT is US$105 which is 33% below our fair value estimate.How far off is Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex..Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years..A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:.2025.2026.2027.2028.2029.2030.2031.2032.2033.2034.

Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) both survived the retail apocalypse that wiped out many brick-and-mortar retailers over the past 15 years.,"Walmart is still growing in a challenging environment..Target is struggling to keep up as it faces tougher headwinds..The pricier stock with the lower dividend is still the better buy..10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›.Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) both survived the retail apocalypse that wiped out many brick-and-mortar retailers over the past 15 years. Both of these superstore chains kept growing by staying away from dying malls, renovating their stores, expanding their e-commerce marketplaces, and using their brick-and-mortar stores to fulfill online orders. They also matched Amazon's prices while expanding their own subscription services..But over the past three years, Walmart's stock rallied more than 140% as Target's stock sank nearly 40%. Let's see why the former outperformed the latter -- and if it remains the better superstore play..Walmart is a larger and more globally diversified retailer than Target. It operates 10,784 stores (including its Walmart, Sam's Club, and other regional banners) and various e-commerce websites in 19 countries..Its largest market is the U.S., but it generates a lot of revenue from Mexico, Canada, China, and other countries. The company also owns a growing digital advertising business, Walmart Connect, which peddles ads across its digital channels and inside its physical stores. It further expanded that advertising ecosystem by acquiring the smart-TV maker Vizio last December..Target operates only 1,981 stores, all in the United States. It previously expanded into Canada by acquiring leases of 133 former Zellers stores from Hudson's Bay Company in 2013, but it hastily exited that market just two years later. The company also operates an integrated advertising business called Roundel, but it's much smaller than Walmart Connect..Walmart and Target both launched a wide range of private label brands to differentiate themselves from the competition while boosting their gross margins. But Walmart's core strategy is to consistently offer ""everyday low prices"" to compete with discount retailers. Target sells slightly pricier goods geared toward more affluent and style-conscious consumers..That's why Walmart usually sells a higher mix of essentials and groceries than Target, which often prioritizes its sales of clothing and home decor over its other product categories. Both retailers continue to expand their online, curbside, and in-store pickup options to counter Amazon..From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this January), Walmart's revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6%, as its earnings per share (EPS) had a CAGR of 14%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-walmart-vs-target-083000788.html,market risk

That surge has lifted the valuations of many stocks back to lofty levels, but there are still plenty of bargains if you know where to look..Some income investors on the hunt for deals today may prefer to scoop up shares of high-yielding dividend payers like NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) or Target (NYSE: TGT), whereas others may go for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds positions in dozens if not hundreds of stocks -- like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI)..Here's why these two stocks and this ETF are great buys now for generating passive income..Scott Levine (NextEra Energy): Those looking to procure prodigious passive income may balk at the sight of NextEra Energy stock's 3.2% forward-yielding dividend, but a peek at its financials will reveal why the clean energy company could be a great choice right now..Operating a portfolio with a generation and storage capacity of about 37 gigawatts (GW), NextEra Energy is one of the leading renewable energy stocks. And with 25 GW of projects in its backlog, NextEra Energy will likely maintain its leadership position for years to come..Consistently profitable, NextEra Energy grew its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) at a 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years to $3.43 in 2024. Management, moreover, expects that growth to continue, projecting its adjusted EPS will rise at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate through 2027..NextEra Energy has hiked its dividend payouts annually for more than three consecutive decades.

The company has been losing ground to rivals such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which have all been reporting better sales growth over the past few years..Last quarter, the company saw its same-store sales drop, in part, due to pushback from customers after the retailer rolled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The company was far from the only one to take such actions following the election of President Donald Trump, but it had taken a lead in these initiatives in the past, so its reversal angered some of its customer base. This included the company facing a 40-day boycott from some customers during Lent..To throw fuel on the fire, the company also warned about the impact of tariffs, as well as ""heightened uncertainty regarding the economy and consumer spending."".The first-quarter numbers for Target certainly were off target. The company's revenue sank nearly 3% year over year to $23.8 billion, as its same-store sales fell 3.8%. Traffic declined 2.4%, while the average ticket decreased by 1.4%..E-commerce sales rose by 4.7% year over year, but in-store comparable-store sales fell by 5.7%. Over 80% of Target's sales come from stores, so this channel has a much bigger impact on same-store sales. Lower sales at stores also reduce operating leverage, and as such, Target's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 36% to $1.30..The only category to see an increase in the quarter was food and beverage, which edged up 0.8%, while beauty was about flat. However, the company said it was able to hold or gain share in 15 of 35 sub-merchandise categories it tracks, noting particular strength in apparel categories such as women's swimwear, performance, and toddler..Another area of strength was its Roundel digital advertising business, which saw revenue climb 25% year over year to $163 million. It also saw mid-single-digit growth in its first-party e-commerce business, with same-day delivery surging by 36% and accounting for nearly half of its total digital sales. Its third-party digital marketplace, meanwhile, saw double-digit growth. However, these businesses are still too small to really help offset the pressure Target is seeing in its core in-store business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/targets-market-share-slipping-time-100500134.html,market risk   operational risk   reputational risk

Additionally, sell-side analysts see potential upside of over 10% for the stock over the next 12 months, highlighting the value at hand..Target reported disappointing Q1 earnings, in which first-quarter sales fell 3%. This was due to challenges that many companies are facing, like tariff uncertainty and a cautious consumer spending environment. This also caused management to lower full-year sales guidance to a low-single-digit decline (down from up 1%) and full-year EPS guidance to a range of $7-9 per share (down from $8.80-9.80)..CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged the challenges Target faced in the first quarter, noting that “In the first quarter, our team and our business faced an exceptionally challenging environment that affected our performance with declines in both traffic and sales, most notably in our discretionary categories.” He pointed to broader economic pressures, adding that the company encountered “additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs…” and other factors..While these issues are widespread across the retail sector and not unique to Target, they are expected to ease over time as consumer sentiment improves and clarity emerges on trade policy. In the meantime, Cornell remains confident in the company’s ability to manage through the turbulence, stating, “We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs, and price is the very last resort,” and emphasizing that Target’s “strategy is to remain price competitive by leveraging the capabilities, long-standing relationships, and the scale that set us apart for many of our retail peers.”.Separately, Target is facing criticism from some activists over the rollback of DEI initiatives. However, in today’s highly polarized environment, companies often face backlash no matter their direction, making this more of a reflection of broader societal tensions than a uniquely Target issue.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-tgt-maintains-dividend-king-183100328.html,market risk   credit risk   dividend risk

With operating margins typically in the narrow 4% to 5% range, the company faces difficult trade-offs between absorbing costs or passing them on to consumers, challenging its low-price core value proposition..Nevertheless, Walmart’s massive scale, strong brand, and strategic agility position it better than most in navigating these pressures, leaving me tentatively optimistic about the stock’s resilience in the face of ongoing trade uncertainty..Walmart’s latest quarterly results were solid, with revenue reaching $165.6 billion—a 2.5% year-over-year increase—and operating margins holding steady at 4.3%. However, the recent wave of global tariffs has injected uncertainty into the outlook, prompting the company to withdraw its second-quarter operating margin guidance. CFO John David Rainey signaled that price hikes are inevitable..While Walmart has reduced its reliance on Chinese imports from 80% in 2018 to around 60% today, China still supplies approximately 15% of its total merchandise—particularly in categories like electronics and toys. Starting in May, and escalating in June, Walmart will begin raising prices across most product lines, a move that drew sharp criticism from President Trump..Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are pushing back against suppliers asked to absorb tariff costs, leaving U.S. retailers like Walmart caught in the middle. Although recent negotiations between the U.S. and China led to a partial rollback of tariffs from previous highs, the current levels still present a significant cost burden, one that even a giant like Walmart is struggling to absorb..Walmart isn’t alone in navigating the challenges posed by tariffs—retailers like Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT) are also being forced to adapt. Home Depot has chosen a different path, opting to discontinue certain product lines and diversify its supply chain rather than raise prices.

That was well below the consensus at $1.65..There was no single reason for Target's weak performance. Rather, it was a familiar chorus of headwinds that plagued the stock. Sales in discretionary categories continued with declines in every retail segment except for food and beverage. Home furnishings and decor were particularly weak, falling 8% to $3.2 billion, which may be a reflection of weakness in the housing sector..Target management noted weakening consumer sentiment and negative effects from a boycott in response to its decision to end its DEI initiatives. That boycott has now ended, but it seems to show evidence that Target is losing touch with its customer base. It's struggling to compete with rivals like Walmart, keep its merchandise fresh, and manage its inventory appropriately..Looking ahead, the company cut its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance from $8.80 to $9.80 to $7.00 to $9.00. It also lowered its full-year sales guidance, calling for a low-single-digit decline in sales..Given the underwhelming first-quarter performance and the cut in guidance, Target isn't giving investors much of a reason for hope..In addition to the challenges the company faces, both with its own issues and a sluggish macro environment, it now has to deal with pressure from tariffs. The company said that it's taking steps to deal with tariffs, including rearranging its supply chain, leveraging its economies of scale, and using other tactics so that it only moves to price increases as a last resort.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-stock-time-panic-102500149.html,- **Market Risk**   - **Operational Risk**   - **Reputational Risk**   - **Financial Risk**

117,2025-05-24 16:30:00,Bear of the Day: Target (TGT),Target stock has cratered as sales have stagnated in recent years and consumers have opted to shop elsewhere,"At a time when discount retailers have emerged as market leaders, Target (TGT) has unfortunately become a notable underperformer. While peers like Walmart and Costco continue to thrive, Target has struggled with stagnant sales, margin pressure, and shifting consumer preferences. These headwinds have weighed heavily on the stock, which is now down roughly 30% year to date and has shown virtually no net return over the past decade..Adding to the bearish outlook, Target currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), reflecting negative earnings estimate revisions and declining analyst sentiment. Technically, the stock has also broken down from a key support level, confirming a bearish pattern that suggests further downside may be ahead..To be clear, Target remains a well-known and widely trusted brand, with long-term potential to rebound. But for now, with both fundamentals and technicals working against it, investors would be wise to stay on the sidelines until signs of a meaningful turnaround in both in earnings momentum and share price behavior begin to emerge..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.The fundamental picture for Target has continued to deteriorate, with analysts sharply lowering their earnings expectations in recent weeks. Current-year EPS estimates have been revised down by 10.9%, while next year’s projections have fallen even further, by 12.2%. These widespread downward revisions reflect weakening confidence in the company’s near-term outlook and reinforce its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)..Target's top-line growth has also been underwhelming. Sales have remained essentially flat over the past three years, and the outlook going forward is hardly inspiring. Revenues are expected to decline by 1.2% in the coming year before rebounding modestly by just 2.6% the year after—a tepid pace that suggests continued pressure from shifting consumer behavior and growing competition from both value-oriented and e-commerce retailers..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.After spending nearly two months consolidating in a tight range, TGT stock broke down below key support this week, signaling renewed technical weakness..Interestingly, the initial move lower did not trigger immediate follow-through selling—often a hallmark of stronger breakdowns. This could be a mildly encouraging sign that the selloff may be losing momentum, or that the stock is searching for a new equilibrium..Still, from a technical standpoint, the trend remains bearish. As long as TGT trades below the $95.60 level, the breakdown is considered valid and the path of least resistance continues to point lower. Without a sustained move back above that former support, now likely acting as resistance, investors should be cautious of further downside pressure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-target-tgt-083000366.html,Market Risk   Operational Risk   Reputation Risk

Big box stores, meanwhile, are reporting quarterly earnings this week, and while it's been a mixed bag for retailers, some names are rising above the competition in the tariff landscape. We're now figuring out how to play the retail sector with the Yahoo Finance playbook, and joining us now is Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. Brian, it is always great to see you. So let's, let's compare and contrast some of the big names in this space, Brian. Get your take on how you kind of see them. One of the first ones would be the obvious one, Walmart and Target. Now, you might throw up those stock charts, Brian, and you can see how that kind of tells the story. Uh, we did recently, this week, Brian, we had a target bull on the show, and I think his argument was more valuation. He just thought a lot of the bad news had been priced into Target. I'm curious how you see it. .Yeah, I certainly understand the argument. I mean, Target's down close to 40% on a year-to-date basis. There is a point where the valuation starts to become a little bit more attractive, but for us, it has to start with some type of earnings growth, and we're just not seeing it, at least in the near term, for Target. They're still continuing to struggle with some legacy issues from COVID, in terms of getting their inventory timing down properly. And now you throw, on top of that, the issue that they still have around 30% of their goods directly sourced from China. So they're really struggling to get things right, to turn the corner, and look better from an earnings growth that profitability picture just isn't clear enough for us to like the name. On the other side, you've got Walmart. They've got a little bit more diversity in their product lineup, and that's showing in the sales growth that they have. You know, April retail sales, I think, came in as a surprise for all of us, and that just, it was positive. It was up 0.1%, but that's $721 billion out there for grabs for these big box retailers, at this moment in time. And what we found in Walmart's earnings is their average ticket size is going up. So foot traffic is roughly flat, maybe slightly lower, but they're getting more wallet share from consumers. And that's the biggest difference between the two stocks right now. You have consistent revenue growth, and consistent profit growth from Walmart, and Target is almost the other side of the coin, almost the complete opposite. .All right. We need a little, like, ding ding ding to talk about the second round here. Um, so let's talk about two other retailers. So clearly you think Walmart has the advantage between Walmart and Target. What about Home Depot and Lowe's, two other retailers we heard from this week, um, and you know, taking a different approach in a number of different areas, including on tariffs. .Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, the news that we got from Home Depot is that here, very soon, their overall exposure to China, and the reason we keep bringing up China is it's the worst-case scenario. The maximum level of tariffs that we know about in this point in time, coming out of China. That's where it impacts earnings over a long period of time. Home Depot says, ""Very quickly, we're going to have less than 10% exposure."" And that adds a lot more durability to their long-term profit structure. Home Depot has also made a lot of investments linking customers to contractors, getting jobs done. And in that retail sales number from April, building materials were up 0.8%. It was one of the bigger drivers in there. And so we saw that reflected in a little bit stronger, I think, than expected numbers from Home Depot coming out of Q1, and they're doing a really good job of managing that long-term profit structure, mitigating the cost of tariffs. And so it's a name that we like more than Lowe's, for similar reasons. Lowe's has more of a DIY type of a feel. And unfortunately, the customers at this point don't want to do it themselves. They want to be connected to that pro segment. Now, Lowe's is growing there. It's one of the faster-growing segments of their business, but they're just really far behind the curve when it comes to those types of projects. And Home Depot's really built a whole system around that pro experience for contractors and bulk orders, and also connecting them to consumers to get jobs done. So we're just finding the integration and the money already spent on that growth is paying off for Home Depot. .And how would you characterize valuation, Brian? I mean, you must find it compelling here. .Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think there's a really good story here. I mean, there's a lot of people out there that are going to be anchored to their properties because they have a 2 or 2.5, 3% mortgage rate. So they're going to continue to stay with those properties, but want to improve them over time. So given the current valuation and the long-term revenue growth, this is a very strong company that has a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and they also want to make sure that they're staying in line with that strong balance sheet directive that they've had over the last three years. It's really paying off well for them because they have low levels of debt. Lowe's, on the other hand, is very leveraged. They have a lot of debt on their balance sheet. And so again, just in terms of where you're assessing risk versus reward over this period of time, Home Depot definitely seems more attractive. .All right. Advantage Home Depot in that round. Round three, we got TJX versus Kohl's. You know, I don't know if this one's quite a fair fight, to be honest, Brian, but talk me through your thinking on these two. .Yeah. So I mean they're almost not even in the same ballpark. If tariffs are your main concern, and we could understand why, TJ Maxx has a variety of ways to source inventory, and sometimes they can buy directly from unsold department store inventories that have already paid tariffs, if there were any, to begin with. So they have a way of getting goods on shelves that are in demand. We all love the name brands that you can find at TJ Maxx and HomeGoods, and pay, obviously, discount prices. There is a model there where TJ Maxx has some exposure to direct manufacturers that come from the Pacific Rim regions, and China being part of that, but they have a way to mitigate that through multiple levels of sourcing. Whereas Kohl's, again, they're still too dependent on China directly to get products on shelves. It's roughly 20 to 25% of anything that you find inside a Kohl's store is going to be subject to those maximum levels of tariffs right now. Again, just putting a lot of pressure on the near-term profit structure that is also weighing down long-term growth. So it really comes down to, know what you own, know why you own it. And at this point, if you're just paying attention to some of those finer details, higher quality balance sheets are winning the day. .At the same time, Brian, you look at that Kohl's stock chart, and this stock has been shelled, Brian. I mean, how much, you obviously just don't think all the bad news is priced in there. .No, I think that they're just not getting things right in terms of sourcing and controlling costs at this moment in time. Unfortunately, I think there's more volatility to come because they just simply can't right the ship and turn a corner to profitability. They're having to continue to further discount goods, weighing on margins. Their average ticket sales is going down at this point in time. So they're having to find different ways to incentivize customers. Adding too many incentives means you're weighing on that profitability. So they can still have a certain amount of top-line sales that keeps the business running, but they're still squeezing that overall profitability, quarter after quarter after quarter. I don't think all the bad news is quite priced in just yet. .Brian, always great to see you. Appreciate your time and those picks, sir. .Have a great weekend. .You too.

Amid this startling trend, the retailer has conjured up a plan to win back customers..In Target’s first-quarter earnings report for 2025, it revealed that while its comparable digital sales increased by 4.7% year-over-year, its comparable store sales decreased by 3.8%..💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵.Specifically, the number of transactions in stores dipped by 2.4%, while the average amount of money customers spent per transaction declined by roughly 1.4%..Related: Target CEO admits a major mistake amid boycotts from customers.The decrease in sales comes during a time when Target faces backlash and boycotts from consumers over its decision in January to scale back its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. This includes withdrawing its participation in the Human Rights Campaign survey, which tracks LGBTQ+ corporate policies and practices..Target also discontinued its three-year DEI goals and concluded its Racial Equity Action and Change initiatives, which involved advancing the careers of Black employees, implementing anti-racism training for team members, promoting Black-owned businesses, sourcing products from Black suppliers, and more..After this decision was announced, Target’s foot traffic in stores started to suffer. According to a recent report from Placer.ai, Target’s visits during the first few months of 2025 fell by 4.1% year-over-year, and visits per location were down by 4.8%..During an earnings call on May 21, Target CEO Brian Cornell said that the company is “not satisfied” with its recent performance and emphasized that it is operating in an “exceptionally challenging environment” that has impacted foot traffic and sales..He said several challenges had a negative impact on business, including inflation, tariffs, and Target’s recent decision to cut back DEI..“For several years now, we’ve seen pressure in our discretionary businesses, as spending adjusted down from elevated levels during the pandemic and then moved further away in the face of historically high inflation in needs-based categories,” said Cornell. “On top of those ongoing challenges, we faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on Belonging in January.”.Related: Walmart CEO has a harsh warning for customers.In order to combat these pressures, Cornell said Target will open a new Enterprise Acceleration Office to simplify how it operates. The company will also make several organizational changes to “bring even more clarity and speed” to how it conducts business and advances its strategy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-ceo-sounds-alarm-customer-163300071.html,Operational Risk   Reputational Risk
120,2025-05-23 17:30:00,Target Stock Is Down 30% Year to Date. Buy the Dip?,"Is it time to buy shares, or could things get worse before they get better?","Target's first-quarter results fell short of expectations..The retailer lowered its full-year outlook for sales and adjusted earnings per share..Despite the stock's big pullback this year, investors should be skeptical..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Target (NYSE: TGT) has seen its stock price tumble approximately 30% year to date, underperforming the broader market by a wide margin. Its disappointing financial results this year have raised questions about the retailer's ability to return to steady, meaningful growth. The company's challenges were especially put in the spotlight on Wednesday morning, when Target reported a decline in sales. Adding to the bad news, management said it no longer expects sales to grow this year..While the results are discouraging, some investors may be wondering if the stock's steep pullback is a buying opportunity. After all, with shares down so sharply, could all of the bad news already be priced into the stock?.The company's recent first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report revealed a 2.8% decline in net sales to $23.85 billion, missing Wall Street expectations. Comparable store sales dropped 3.8%, with a 5.7% decrease in physical store sales. This was partially offset by a 4.7% increase in digital sales. Adjusted earnings per share fell 35.9% to $1.30, below analysts' consensus forecast of $1.61. Although GAAP earnings per share rose to $2.27. But this figure was aided by a legal settlement..Several factors have contributed to Target's recent struggles. The company attributed the sales decline to economic uncertainty, tariff impacts, and customer boycotts related to its stance and recent retreat on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Given these troubles, Target downgraded its 2025 outlook, now anticipating a low-single-digit sales decline rather than the previously projected 1% increase. Further, management said it now expects adjusted earnings per share for the year to be between $7 and $9. Previously, management was targeting a range between $8.80 and $9.80..Given consumers' declining confidence in an uncertain environment, Target is rolling out more items at lower prices to appeal to its customers' growing interest in value. Specifically, the company is launching 10,000 low-cost products to attract budget-conscious shoppers..Regarding tariffs, Target is reducing its dependence on Chinese imports. Management said that 30% of its products come from China today. But it expects that figure to come down 25% by the end of next year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-stock-down-30-date-093000166.html,Market Risk

Any pressure on prices represents a headwind for these players in two ways: They face higher costs, and their customers may find themselves with less buying power..This is a situation that arises during certain economic periods over time, and it can hurt even well-established companies.

The company also has faced criticism from some groups for its diversity, equity, and inclusion program, then criticism from others as it toned down these initiatives. All of this has hurt sales growth too..But it's important to consider some key positive points that could lead to long-term revenue growth and share-price performance. First of all, Target's sales soared during early pandemic days, with the company gaining more than $30 billion in just a few years -- and Target has kept its gains as you can see in the chart below..TGT Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts..The retailer, which built up its digital presence in those initial pandemic times, continues to see growth in that area.

On Wednesday, Target registered first-quarter sales of $23.85 billion (down 2.8% year over year), which missed the Street view of $24.32 billion..The retail giant lowered its FY2025 adjusted EPS guidance from $8.80–$9.80 to $7.00–$9.00. Following the results, analysts have made several adjustments to their ratings and price forecasts for the stock. Here are the key analysts’ takes on the stock:.BofA Securities analyst Robert F. Ohmes downgraded Target from Buy to Neutral, lowering the price forecast from $145 to $105..Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman downgraded the stock from Outperform to Market Perform, decreasing the price forecast from $130 to $110..JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers reiterated the Neutral rating on the company, raising the price forecast from $105 to $109..Also Read: $1 Items, Made Outside China: Here’s How Target Has Been Tariff-Proofing Its Shelves, With Price Hikes ‘The Very Last Resort’.BofA Securities: Ohmes notes that while Target is experiencing overall softness in comparable sales, the company continues to perform well in areas like digital channels, seasonal categories, and brand partnerships, including the recent Kate Spade launch..The analyst writes that merchandising efforts could help strengthen Target’s appeal and value perception over time. However, the stock is now notably lagging behind peers such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)..Ohmes has lowered the FY26 adjusted EPS estimate to $6.95 from $9.10. For the second quarter, the analyst projects EPS of $1.50 and a 2% decline in comps..Ongoing margin pressures are likely, and he flags increased uncertainty due to persistent top-line weakness, pressure from tariffs, and a delayed comp recovery. Softer sales are also expected to lead to more markdowns, which would further weigh on margins. Over the long term, Ohmes believes expansion in high-margin segments like marketplace and digital advertising could help improve margin stability..Telsey Advisory Group: Feldman observes that competitors like Walmart are gaining ground in several of Target’s key product areas, holding or increasing share in 15 of 35 categories in Q1 FY25, particularly by appealing to higher-income shoppers through broader assortments, better pricing, and greater convenience..The analyst also expressed a cautious stance on the newly formed Enterprise Acceleration Office. As a result, he has reduced his 2025 EPS estimate to $7.71 from $8.80 and now expects comparable sales to decline 2.5%, versus a previous estimate of a 0.3% drop.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-under-pressure-tariffs-rising-191427611.html,- Operational Risk - Market Risk - Competitive Risk

This was complemented by new sales guidance indicating a cautious outlook. Meanwhile, the overall market experienced a 1.1% decline, aligning with Target's flat stock performance over the last month.

These 23 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's..Target's recent initiatives, including the establishment of the Enterprise Acceleration Office led by Michael Fiddelke, signal a focused effort to streamline operations and improve organizational efficiency. Although the company's Q1 earnings report indicated growth in net income and EPS, a slight decline in year-over-year sales coupled with cautious sales guidance suggests a measured approach to future revenue forecasts. The company's strategy to enhance its digital tools and loyalty programs, like Target Circle, and to expand the Target Plus marketplace is expected to drive future growth. However, these developments come amid an overall market decline of 1.1%, which aligns with Target's flat stock performance over the past month..Over a five-year period, Target's total shareholder return, accounting for share price and dividends, was a decline of 10.27%, highlighting a significant underperformance compared to the US Consumer Retailing industry, which returned 29.4% over the past year. This long-term performance context underscores potential challenges in maintaining consistent growth, despite short-term operational changes aimed at boosting revenue and margins. Target's strategic initiatives may contribute positively to its revenue and earnings forecasts, which anticipate earnings reaching US$4.6 billion by 2028. The share price is currently trading at a discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$127.78, which is 26.7% higher than the current share price of US$93.65.

It was valued at nearly $6.2 billion in 2022 when it first announced plans. The IPO comes amid uncertainty about the health of the overall stock market and after a years-long dry spell for healthcare IPOs..Hinge Health CEO Daniel Perez told Yahoo Finance that a dozen digital health CEOs called him prior to Thursday to wish him well, say congratulations, ""and don't screw it up."".""We are not as worried (about) where the stock price ends today,"" Perez added. ""Our vision is to use technology to automate the delivery of care. And that's going to take 10, 20, 30-plus years to continue to realize that vision."".The industry peaked in the pandemic years, specifically in 2021, as demand for remote-based care options rose. That year, more than a dozen companies went public directly or through special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC)..Since 2021, it has been quiet as many of the public companies lost their value, since remote services became less relevant. But Hinge is testing the waters, and investors are watching closely for signs of a revival of the industry..Hinge aimed for a $3 billion valuation on Thursday, offering 13.7 million shares on the market. Its initial public offering (IPO) is on the higher end of the range it provided, between $28 to $32 per share, to raise about $500 million..When asked if he regretted not going public when his valuation was double the Thursday target, Perez said, ""absolutely not."".The company has in the interim been able to build a stronger foundation and become cash positive..""We had a great valuation then, but since that moment we have quintupled our revenue, we've doubled our gross profit...we swung from losing $100 million a year back then, to being free cash flow positive for four straight quarters. Very happy to go public at this point,"" Perez said..Hinge launched a decade ago in its current form, transforming from its predecessor, UK-based Marblar Limited, which was a digital technology platform for scientists. Now it is a remote physical therapy platform, with an FDA-approved wearable to pair with services. It has been growing with the support of investors, including Tiger Global and Coatue Management..The company now boasts almost half of Fortune 500 companies as clients — including Target (TGT), GM (GM), and Hyatt (H) — offering their employees zero-cost access to the platform.

We are watching Target and Urban Outfitters. Joining me now, we've got my morning brief co-host, Madison Mills. First up, Maddie, we got to set the stage here. Yep. Target. Target cut to neutral from buy at Bank of America. This is following a sluggish first quarter. The retailer says, partly due to consumer protests around its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, and the reverse course there. BofA writing in a research note that they're unsure when sales will bounce back and expect profits to be squeezed. Shares, they are higher today by about 2% here. We were watching this one closely when they did report earnings though, Maddie. .Yeah, one of the things that stands out to me from this note here is that they talk about how the gap between Target and their peers has continued to widen. They do continue to see strong trends in digital and seasonal events, and merchandising initiatives could help, but they're underperforming their peers like a Walmart, for example, when it comes to things like foot traffic and compsales. Uh they also obviously talk about the company's gross margin and EPS miss and the lowering of their guidance here off the back of concerns about their digital fulfillment and supply chain costs, uncertainty on the top line as well, and softer sales driving higher markdowns and thus incremental margin pressure for the company longer term. They also think that growth in high margin businesses like marketplace and digital advertising could support stability. But I think it points to the question mark in the room for now for a company like Target that has said they're going to maintain prices. Do analysts necessarily want to hear that from a company that is definitely going to be impacted from from tariff policy, uh that there's not going to be that cushion on profits that comes from raising prices on consumers? .Yeah. Former Vice Chairman, Jerry Storch, telling us earlier today that they're operating in a way that is off strategy and they're not who they're supposed to be right now. If will and who they always have been. So, uh, not executing well was his kind of net takeaway from that. Yeah. Also here, in retail land, if you will, Urban Outfitters soaring after beating on the top and bottom line in the first quarter. Analysts highlighting the performance of its namesake brand, which also beat on net sales here. Taking a look at shares, they're up by 22% here today, uh, ripping to the upside, one might even say. Like those ripped jeans. Yeah. .Hey, nice. Good job. Good job. Yeah, D.A. Davidson Capital Markets, uh, saying that it is a broad-based beat for Urban Outfitters here, strong momentum. Believe that barring a slip up or macro pressure emerging later this year, they continue to see that momentum going forward. And it's interesting. Remember, Urban is the parent company of the likes of Anthropologie, Free People, and that namesake brand, Urban Outfitters. They also have the clothing rental line through Newly here. But we did see sales beats really across the board here. Obviously, bigger beat when it came to Urban Outfitters on estimates, but also beat for Free People. We came in just shy, actually, for Free People, but it was a beat on Anthropologie. Newly net sales also coming in above the street's estimates and the retail net sales coming in above estimates as well. And what's interesting about that mix is that it hits a lot of different income streams as well. So, Urban Outfitters, perhaps a little bit more accessible brand for consumers versus the Free People and Anthros a little bit pricier. .Yeah, good Philadelphia-based company there. And no doubt they're probably celebrating, uh, the passage of the tush push, continuing to be able to be used.

What do you think? .Well, I think that this is a broken story. Uh they're they're operating in a way that uh is off strategy. They're not who they're supposed to be if you will and who they've always been. And meanwhile, uh they're not executing well. Other than that, everything's great. Meanwhile, Walmart is firing on all cylinders, uh continuing to reinforce their low price position and executing uh beautifully. .Jerry, you think about some of your own services as vice chair of Target in the past, to the extent that you still have the pulse of those who are still on the board of directors here, what are they discussing right now? What are they thinking of Brian Cornell and the leadership? .Look, I can't speculate as to what the board uh might be thinking about. I can walk into the stores though and see uh there's a lot wrong with the business right now. And it's kind of been a a string of uh I I hate to use this word, but of excuses that they've given on their earnings calls for many, many, many quarters now starting from the pandemic till now. Uh you know, they they were talking all the time about retail theft and what a big problem that was, and that's a real problem, but it affects everyone. And uh it doesn't affect them uniquely if they have been performing uniquely poorly. Uh similarly, you know, they they uh have had this distraction related to uh DEI where first they were in trouble for going too far and now they're in trouble because they pulled back. And uh again, I'm sure that affects their business somewhat, but it's not what's wrong at the core of the of the business. So it's it's you know, the consumer stressed, of course the consumer stressed, but that doesn't seem to bother Walmart's consumer, they seem to be doing just great. So essentially, uh you know, Target as they sit right now is just not Target. I mean their prices are too high. Uh they're high low all the time with with all these offers and buy one, get one or get a discount or get a gift card. A loyalty program that saps the low price position because you only get the best price when you're on sale. Uh the stores are are not clean like they used to be. There's uh fixtures intentionally in the aisle, which would have been grounds for dismissal if you went to visit a store, saw something the the aisle in the passage. It's just not Target right now. .What can Target, um what lessons can Target maybe learn from what Walmart has been doing correctly over the past few years? .Well, you have to be who you are and they're not they're not exactly the same even though we have a tendency to as if they are. They're both discounters, but Walmart the low price discounter. For Target to succeed, they have to differentiate themselves from Walmart. They can't look like Walmart when you walk inside, and right now they just look too much like Walmart. I mean, while the prices are higher. So what's the point? And I think that's what the consumer is feeling. They're still, you know, have some some wins now and then where they do a collaboration with Taylor Swift or with a designer or that kind of thing. But those things are really, really tiny, you know, in the scheme of the absolute absolute business. There's some fundamental strategic issues beyond that. Uh, you know, uh uh they have de-emphasized grocery relative to the rest of their business when you compare uh Walmart who's the world's largest grocer. And so grocery drives frequency. Consumable products drive frequency. And uh Target Target has been relying very heavily on nice to have products, but not must have products, and that has been absolutely incorrect in this environment. But this environment is lasting for years. And so uh you can't you eventually have to deal with it. So so fundamental business issues are at the core of what's going on here, and they have to take ownership of that and uh and and fix it. And so it starts with what's the strategy? Who are we? And then once you have that, which I think is pretty clear because it's only been clear for like 50 years, so why would you change it? Then it's then it's, you know, how do we execute against that, which they're not doing either. I mean there's lines, lines to check out. It was always the fastest checkout that you could get uh at Target. Their out of stocks are too high. You know, there's just serious business issues right now. .Sure.

136,2025-05-22 07:51:00,Target’s problems are escalating,Target’s was already facing a very public revolt from some of its most loyal customers. Now it’s warning about tariffs.,"Target was already facing a very public revolt from some of its most loyal customers. Now it’s warning about tariffs..The company said Wednesday that sales fell last quarter, driven in part by customer backlash to Target’s reversal on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Target also cut its guidance as President Donald Trump’s tariffs push up costs for the company..Target’s sales at stores open for at least a year tumbled 3.8% last quarter. Fewer customers visited Target and spent less when they shopped. Target also cut its financial outlook, a sign Target’s problems won’t go away quickly. The company expects sales to decline by low single-digits this year..The company announced that it established a multi-year “Enterprise Acceleration Office” to speed up growth plans, and it reshuffled its executive team..“We faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on (DEI) in January,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with analysts Wednesday..Cornell warned of “massive potential costs” from tariffs, but said the retailer could offset them by diversifying suppliers, adjusting products – and hiking prices, if necessary..“We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,” he said..Target’s stock (TGT) dropped 7% during pre-market trading Wednesday. Target’s stock has declined 37% over the past year..Cornell acknowledged in a recent email to staff that it has been “a tough few months” between the retail economy “headlines, social media and conversations that may have left you wondering,” the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. (Target confirmed the email to CNN.).Cornell said Target’s culture and commitment to staff has not changed..“I recognize that silence from us has created uncertainty, so I want to be very clear: We are still the Target you know and believe in,” Cornell said..Boycotts over Target’s DEI reversal hurt Target’s business..On January 24, days into Donald Trump’s presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it had a new strategy called “Belonging at the Bullseye” and the company remained committed to “creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities.” Target also stressed the need for “staying in step with the evolving external landscape.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-problems-escalating-131228679.html,Operational Risk   Reputational Risk   Economic Risk
137,2025-05-22 06:50:00,A Closer Look at Retail Earnings,"Target became the latest big-box retailer to come out with results, which follows results from Walmart, TJX Companies, and others. What should investors know about the broader retail outlook?","Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>.Here are the key points:. .Total Q1 earnings for the 469 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +11.5% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, with 74.2% beating EPS estimates and 62.5% beating revenue estimates.. .Companies struggled to beat consensus estimates this reporting cycle, with the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for this group of 469 index members tracking below what we had seen from the group in other recent periods, as well as the average for this group over the preceding 20-quarter period.. .For the Retail sector, we now have Q1 results from 96% of the sector’s members in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail sector companies are up +11.5% from the same period last year on +5% higher revenues, with 56% beating EPS estimates and 52% beating revenue estimates.. .The +11.5% earnings growth pace for these Retail sector companies drops to a decline of -5.2% once Amazon’s substantial contribution is excluded. The EPS and revenue beats percentages for the group are materially below historical averages for this same group of Retail sector companies.. .The earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with Target TGT becoming the latest big-box retailer to come out with results, which follows results from Walmart WMT, TJX Companies TJX, and others..Target found a way to come up short of even the materially lowered estimates, which has become almost a recurring theme for them in the post-COVID period. They have been steadily losing ground, with Walmart and Amazon making inroads into its market share..Walmart, on the other hand, can’t seem to do anything wrong, with its growing digital business not only providing an efficient channel to monetize its essentials-centric merchandise and attract an ever-growing share of the high-income households but also opening up growth opportunities in high-margin activities like advertising, third-party marketplace, and even data..Part of Target’s problems is a result of consumer spending trends that have shifted away from the company’s discretionary merchandise. It has an essentials business like groceries as well, but that business is far smaller than Walmart’s. While roughly 60% of Walmart’s revenues comes from its essentials merchandise, the ratio for Target is roughly 20%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/closer-look-retail-earnings-225000384.html,market risk

The company reporting first quarter earnings and cutting its sales outlook due to tariff uncertainty. For more in the state of the company, let's bring in Michael Laser, US hardline, broadline and food retail analyst at UBS. Michael, thank you so much for joining us. I actually want to start at the top of Target because today we also learned that the chief operating officer, Michael Fideki, is going to lead a new group at Target. They're calling it the multi-year accelerated acceleration office, which is focused on target moving faster on some of its growth priorities, just basically trying to break the cycle that it's been in. But is this also a signal that maybe things need to change at the very top of the company? Is this a signal about Brian Cornell at all? How should we be reading this? .Well, you should be reading this is indeed there should be change throughout the organization. Clearly in the first quarter, Target lost share. It lost share to a host of retailers. And the encouraging news is that it's saying this is not acceptable. And the reason why it needs this acceleration office is because retail is changing faster today than it ever has in the past. Target most likely got complacent for a period of time. It was working, it was doing well, and it was holding its own. Now, it is falling behind. So it is doing things like seeing if it can implement new technology projects faster than it originally expected, changing some of the assortment quicker than what it once did. We think that ultimately this will usher in change, which will be good for Target, and improve Target's positioning in the market, which will be good for the stock. .So if I put you in charge, Michael, you're CEO of Target now, what specific moves would you make? .I'd do two things, Josh. Number one, Target needs to double down on some of what made Target unique in the past. For example, the limited time offers in partnership with key brands like Kate Spade, Champion, others that it's done in the past. That is what consumers go to Target for. Launching new private label brands like Good and Gather, it needs to keep delighting and surprising the consumer. Second, Target also needs to do a better job of execution. What that means is having the stores stocked well, engaging in good customer service, ensuring that end-to-end experiences for the consumer are really positive. The switching costs for retail today are incredibly low. All you have to do is open a new browser, turn on a new app, go to a new store. So it's really hard for a retailer to maintain loyalty. What will enable Target to do better is stick to what it is, which is a surprise and delight retailer, and do a better job of executing with the core foundational experience for the consumer. .So I guess then the question becomes, Michael, can specifically CEO Brian Cornell do that? Do you think that, you know, after his tenure at the retailer, he's done it in the past. Is he the right guy to do the to execute on those items that you mentioned? .I think you answered the question in that Brian's got history of making change. And, you know, time will tell the degree to which he's well positioned to make change here. I think Target will get back to the Target that it has been of old. It's just going to take some time. Now what what is important here is that this has been a wake-up call for Target that it cannot sit still. The status quo cannot prevail. It is not acceptable what Target's been achieving in the last couple of years. And so time will tell if the right team is in place to be able to effectuate change. I I I believe that this current team can generate improved performance and be able to fulfill the potential that Target offers in the market. .Michael, great to see you. Always appreciate your time and your analysis. Thank you, sir. .Good to see you as well. Thanks. .Likewise.

While digital sales rose 4.7%, it wasn't enough to offset broader weakness in its core discretionary categories..The Minneapolis-based retailer now expects a low-single-digit decline in annual sales, versus a prior forecast for roughly 1% growth. Adjusted full-year earnings per share are projected between $7 and $9, down from an earlier range of $8.80 to $9.80..CEO Brian Cornell attributed the results to macroeconomic headwinds and internal challenges. He noted that Target held or gained market share in only 15 of 35 categories tracked internally. We're not happy with that, Cornell said..In response, Target launched an ""Enterprise Acceleration Office"" under COO Michael Fiddelke to streamline operations and reignite growth. The company also announced executive departures, including its chief strategy and legal officers..About 30% of Target's private-label merchandise now comes from China, down from 60% in 2017, as the company adjusts its supply chain to reduce tariff risk. Pricing remains in flux, with Cornell saying any increases tied to tariffs would be a last resort..Despite the challenges, Target saw a 36% year-over-year increase in same-day deliveries through its Circle 360 membership, and strong demand for its limited-edition Kate Spade collection..Investors will be watching how Target manages cost pressures and whether its turnaround plans gain traction in the second half of the year..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-tgt-warns-full-sales-194040108.html,- Operational Risk - Reputational Risk - Financial Risk
145,2025-05-22 02:31:00,DEI boycott 'played a role' in Target's Q1 sales slump as foot traffic declined,Target and Walmart both faced boycotts over pulling back from their DEI efforts. But Target got the worst of the effects.,"Target's (TGT) sluggish first quarter was partly due to consumers' protests to the retail giant's rollback on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies..On Wednesday, shares of the retailer slid more than 7% after it posted a 3.8% year-over-year decline in same-store sales, compared to the 3.7% drop it saw last year..CEO Brian Cornell said during the earnings call that one headwind Target faced in the quarter was consumer reaction to ""updates"" it shared on belonging in January..Those reactions, Cornell said, compounded ongoing pressure on consumers' discretionary spending amid five months of declining consumer confidence and uncertainty about tariffs..""While we believe each of these factors played a role in our first quarter performance, we can't reliably estimate the impact of each one separately,"" Cornell said..The retailer announced in January it would scale back its ""Belonging at the Bullseye"" strategy that focused on hiring and supplier diversity goals. The changes also ended Target's participation in external diversity-focused surveys, including the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index..Target was mentioned as a specific focal point for advocacy group Black Wall Street Ticker, which in February called for a 40-day ""corporate fast"" from spending any money at the chain between March 5 and April 17..Target is one of dozens of companies that announced recent about-faces on diversity, a list that also includes Walmart (WMT), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), McDonald's (MCD), Amazon (AMZN), and Tractor Supply (TSCO)..For the week of March 3, Walmart's foot traffic was down 0.7% year over year, while Target's foot traffic was down 6.8%, according to Placer.ai. They haven't seen a full recovery so far this year..Meanwhile, foot traffic at Costco (COST) — which has affirmed its support for DEI policies and was listed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as part of a ""Black Consumer Advisory"" initiative — was up 7% year over year in the week of March 3..Walmart has faced some repudiation, including from its own investors. More than 30 shareholders representing $266 billion in assets sent a message earlier this year to CEO Doug McMillon that called the retailer's recent DEI policy changes ""very disheartening."".Yet, Walmart's US same-store sales jumped 4.5% year over year in its latest quarter, besting estimates of 3.85%. Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst Bill Kirk told Yahoo Finance that this is a larger narrative as Walmart outpaces Target's growth rate by four times.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dei-boycott-played-a-role-in-targets-q1-sales-slump-as-foot-traffic-declined-183135827.html,reputational risk   operational risk

Also, its full-year EPS guidance missed and was projected to drop significantly from the previous year's level. Overall, this was a softer quarter..The shares closed the day at $92.99, down 5.3% from previous close..The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Target? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free..Target’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 8 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business..The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock dropped 22.4% on the news that the company reported weak third-quarter results. Despite a modest increase in comparable sales driven by strong guest traffic and digital sales, same-store sales declined by 1.9%, reflecting a drop in in-store purchases..Profitability also came under pressure, as gross margin fell slightly due to higher supply chain and fulfillment costs. This, combined with elevated operating expenses, contributed to a significant EPS miss..Additionally, Target's full-year EPS guidance was reduced and missed significantly, further disappointing investors..Management called out ""unique challenges and cost pressures that impacted our bottom-line performance."" Overall, this was a surprisingly bad quarter..Target is down 32.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $93.14 per share, it is trading 42% below its 52-week high of $160.69 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Target’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $784.80..Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

148,2025-05-22 00:23:00,Target reports dismal earnings amid DEI ‘headwinds’ and says two C-suite women leaders are on the way out,Analysts and industry watchers aren’t convinced that the company’s changes will turn things around,"The retail giant Target continues to wander in troubled territory..In an earnings call today, CEO Brian Cornell told investors that the company has suffered declines in sales, partly because consumers are spending less on discretionary goods amid uncertainty over tariffs, but also because of “headwinds” caused by a customer boycott of its January decision to roll back DEI initiatives. Target saw its total sales drop by nearly 3%, while comparable sales fell 3.8%. And like many other companies, the retailer lowered sales guidance for the year, citing tariff costs..“I want to be clear that we’re not satisfied with these results,” Cornell told reporters. Target’s share price has dropped a whopping 37% over the past year and fell further on today’s announcements..Against that backdrop, Target shared a significant leadership shuffle on Wednesday that includes the departure of two women from its C-suite team: Christina Hennington, chief strategy and growth officer, and Amy Tu, chief legal officer. The company also said it will create a new “Enterprise Acceleration Office” to help drive efficiencies and growth..But analysts and industry watchers aren’t convinced that the company’s modifications will turn things around. Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail wrote in a research note that the changes “do nothing to restore confidence in the company. On the contrary, they are emblematic of a business that has made too many mistakes and has lost its way on several fronts.”.DeAnn Campbell, an independent retail consultant in Atlanta, says she’s concerned that Target has lost a major talent in Hennington, who worked at Target for 21 years and was widely seen as a possible successor to Brian Cornell. “She really spearheaded their DEI program and has been pushing it quite a bit in the company, so to see her departure is not solving the problem,” Campbell told Fortune..Hennington has a “brilliant mind” for partnerships, and was instrumental in building Target’s groundbreaking partnership with Ulta Beauty and the sale of its pharmacies to CVS, she added. Losing that kind of strategist right now is a disappointment, she argues, as Target tries to reinvigorate its in-store sales experience. “How are we going to get Target back to that big box, boutique feel?” she says..Target, Hennington, and Tu did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment..Hennington first joined the retailer as a buyer for its Toys department in 2003, according to her LinkedIn profile, and eventually held C-suite roles in merchandising and growth before being named chief strategy and growth office only one year ago. Before arriving at Target, Amy Tu spent six years at Tyson Foods, and a similar amount of time at Boeing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-reports-dismal-earnings-amid-162305463.html,1.

Analysts currently expect $8.65 for EPS and $106.98B in revenue for the fiscal year. CEO Brian Cornell said the company expects more than $15B sales growth over the next five years..JPMorgan reduced estimates for Q1 and the year on sales softness and promotional risk. JPMorgan expects a guidance cut from Target. Uncertainty and tough weather affected goods purchasing in Q1 with some improvement in April on less punitive weather and the Easter shift, the analyst told investors in a research note. Citi expects the company’s Q1 sales and earnings to come in below consensus. Foot traffic data indicates Target’s traffic did not accelerate in March, and only accelerated slightly in April, the analyst told investors. Citi believes investors expect a guidance cut. While expectations are low, soft sales trends and an earnings miss could move the stock lower near-term, contended Citi. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said Q1 comps likely slowed and 2025 guidance is due for revision, though Target is pursuing the right omnichannel and retail media priorities longer-term.  ‘GOING GETTING TOUGH’: Bernstein on May 12 downgraded Target to Underperform from Market Perform with a price target of $82, down from $97. The firm says “the going is getting tough for Target.” Credit card data “paints a bleak picture” for the company’s Q1, dampened by poor weather, weak consumer sentiment, and a DEI-related strike in March, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Bernstein believes this is all before tariffs “enter the frame,” which means that Target will likely have to lower guidance for the full year. It thinks Target faces a difficult trade off between stimulating sales growth and maintaining margins. The firm’s analysis shows that it is “unlikely to achieve both and, increasingly, neither.”.While Target’s Q1 risks seem well documented, its underlying trends seem more concerning, Barclays said ahead of the earnings report. When looking beyond the tariffs, questions remain over how much of the sales slowdown was transactions-driven as that has been a key support of the Target story “but seems to have weakened,” the analyst said. Barclays believes this could add further multiple risk to the story. Target’s multi-year share gains since 2020 continue to reverse, and it is not clear how that changes at this point, the firm argued.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-experts-saying-target-161014234.html,earnings risk

Compared to this time last year, Target’s first-quarter sales fell by 2.8%, failing to meet Wall Street’s expectations. According to a consensus estimate cited by CNBC, analysts were expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.61. Target reported adjusted EPS of $1.30..Months ago, Target stepped away from DEI, bowing to President Trump, who has made anti-DEI initiatives a cornerstone of his second-term agenda..Target’s move did not go unnoticed by loyal shoppers. In the wake of the decision, many called for boycotts, and some vowed to shop only at stores that stand for equality. Sales fell, as did Target’s stock, which has tanked at least 40% over the last year, as Fast Company‘s Elizabeth Segran reported recently..Of its latest dip in revenue, CEO Brian Cornell told reporters, per CNBC, that the company only held market share in 15 of the 35 merchandise categories that it tracks internally, meaning the Target brand is falling behind competitors..“We’re not happy with that,” Cornell said. “We’ve got to be growing [market] share in 60, 70, 80% of those categories.”.Cornell also said that in order to address the impact of tariffs, the brand is “constantly adjusting pricing.” He said, “Some are going up, some will be reduced, but that’s an ongoing effort that takes place each and every day.”.But the CEO pointed to other issues impacting sales, too, like “declining consumer confidence,” and, perhaps the most impactful, the brand’s move away from DEI. He referred to the major blowback somewhat gently as “the reaction to the updates we shared on belonging in January.”.However, the fallout for Target has been anything but gentle. While many companies stepped away from DEI programs after Trump came into office this January, boycotts have seemed to hit Target harder..Jamal Bryant, the Atlanta-based pastor who helped kick-start the Target boycott, previously told Fast Company that he believes it’s because the move demonstrated the brand’s previous commitments to Black-owned brands were perhaps merely performative.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-stock-tumbles-again-customer-151000639.html,Reputational Risk   Operational Risk   Financial Risk

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CX Dive newsletter. .Target’s strength in digital, driven by its multitude of fulfillment options, was a bright spot in an otherwise “exceptionally challenging” quarter, according to CEO Brian Cornell on a Q1 2025 earnings call Wednesday..Digital comparable sales rose 4.7% year over year, led by a 36% uptick in same-day delivery through the Target 360 loyalty program, according to Cornell. Curbside pickup now accounts for nearly half of all digital orders..However, comparable sales dropped 3.8% year over year and same-store sales fell 5.7% year over year, according to a company earnings release. EVP and CFO Jim Lee attributed the decline to a 2.4% year-over-year reduction in foot traffic and a 1.4% drop in average basket size..Target’s online success may be partially responsible for its in-store woes, which were the inverse of a strong fourth quarter 2024 performance that included a 2% traffic increase..The retailer’s average order fulfillment speed was nearly 20% faster year over year in the first quarter of 2025, according to EVP and COO Michael Fiddelke. The number of same-day deliveries was up 5% year over year, and 70% of all online orders were delivered to customers within one day..The retailer’s digital performance is a highlight, but its strength comes with hidden costs, according to Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. Delivery can be expensive, and store-based fulfillment takes up time and effort that could be spent on other tasks..“Some of these things have harmed stores as store staff are now spending more time looking after online orders, so they have less time to attend to the basics in store, which worsens the customer experience,” Saunders told CX Dive in an email..In turn, worse in-store experiences can push more customers online, according to Saunders. While this isn’t necessarily negative, online shoppers are less likely to make impulse purchases — leading to smaller basket sizes..Target is fighting back against fulfillment costs by making deliveries through its Shipt business, which uses independent contractors, according to Fiddelke. Shipt drivers fulfilled 24% more packages year over year, driving down costs while contributing to faster delivery speeds..Target’s abandonment of DEI goals has also cost it some business, though it isn’t the only factor costing the retailer sales, according to Saunders.

Revenues of $23.85 billion were -1.58% short of expectations. The big-box retailer has also cut forecasts to negative growth from slightly positive earlier expected. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)The impact of tariffs are impacting guidance levels of retailers like Target. But the company has also been “targeted” with a boycott over its public rollback of DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) policy. This has led to some brand damage for Target, evident in its -41% share price drop over the past year.

Earnings of $2.92 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 4 cents per share, with revenues of $20.93 billion marginally outpacing the $20.92 billion anticipated.

The parent of TJ Maxx, Marshall’s and HomeGoods reported a 2-cent beat to 92 cents per share in Q1, on revenues of $13.11 billion which improved over the $13.0 billion anticipated. Comps grew +3% year over year, although forward guidance is down slightly. TJX shares are down a tad at this hour.VF Corp. VFC, the parent of Timberland, Vans, North Face and other apparel brands, posted mixed results for its fiscal Q4 this morning. The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss of -13 cents per share versus -15 cents estimated, but revenues of $2.14 billion were short of the $2.18 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is the fourth-straight bottom-line beat for VFC, but shares are tumbling -14% on a “challenging macro environment.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-retailers-report-earnings-tgt-142600297.html,market risk

159,2025-05-21 21:55:00,Commentary: Target CEO signals potential successor as retailer battles through hosts of struggles,"Target sends a signal to investors about who is likely to assume the position of CEO next, possibly soon.","There are often two ways a CEO of a public company rides off into the sunset..One is when the CEO realizes they can't do more at a company and that current results are as good as they are likely to get in the near term..They hand the reins to someone younger, a candidate who has been developed over the years to wade into rejiggering an already finely tuned operation..In this case, the grizzled veteran CEO will usually slip into an executive chairman role for a year to oversee their pupil..Another way is to recognize that it's time for a change in voice or a new generation, if you will, for the good of the company and shareholders..The situation for longtime Target (TGT) CEO and chairman Brian Cornell looks to be an amalgamation of both. And how Cornell and the Target board — comprised of former CEOs of UPS (UPS), Clorox (CLX), Safeway, and Cardinal Health (CAH) — act could set the tone for the next decade as the chain tries to reclaim market share from Walmart (WMT) and thwart the new world order of tariffs..Somewhat lost in the retailer's brutal first quarter results (a recurring theme for Target since last year) is the announcement of a new ""multi-year Enterprise Acceleration Office."".Target said this is more than just corporate jargon. The office will be led by COO Michael Fiddelke, the former Target intern who started at the retailer in 2003 and rose to CFO before his current title..Fiddelke — who has the same calm demeanor as Cornell — will be tasked with improving operating efficiencies throughout the company and driving faster decision making at the top..In effect, Fiddelke is now leading one of the most important initiatives at the company while still being COO and reporting directly to Cornell. If he can get Target back to efficient earnings growth, Fiddelke may be handed the keys to the kingdom..With more results like the ones over the past five quarters, the board may be inclined to look outside the existing management team for a new CEO. It would be similar to what happened more than 10 years ago when Cornell was brought in..A decision on the CEO position could be coming soon..In September 2022, Target scrapped its CEO retirement age of 65. Cornell signed on for three more years, making 2025 the year when a successor could be announced..A Target spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that CEO succession is led by the board. They added that Cornell doesn't have a ""contract"" and committed in September 2022 to lead the company for approximately three more years..""He will retire soon,"" one former CEO with ties to the retailer told Yahoo Finance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-target-ceo-signals-potential-successor-as-retailer-battles-through-hosts-of-struggles-135538544.html,Operational Risk

The retailer hit by weak consumer spending, tariff uncertainty, and backlash against its DEI rollback. The stock down a little over 6%. Joining us now, Bill Kirk, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst. Bill, great to have you on this morning. I, I want to get your reaction to this print, the uncertainty that Target talked about in comparison to what we're hearing from other retailers. Do you think that the price action of the downside is justified based off of what we got out of this print? .Uh, thanks for having me and, and yes, uh, simply put, uh, I do think the price action is, is justified. Um, you know, you kind of led with compared to other retailers and I think that's a great way to do it. If you contrast Target's results today to Walmart's last week, you see a stark difference. Uh, you know, Target comparable store sales decelerated uh, from plus 1.5 last quarter to minus 3.8 this quarter. Take Walmart. Walmart did 4.8 this quarter from 4.9 last quarter. So no change at Walmart on comparable store sales and a deceleration of five percentage points at Target. Uh, if you do profitability, Walmart earnings this quarter up year over year, slightly, but up. Target EPS, adjusted EPS, down 35% or so year over year. So I think when you contrast it against other retailers in particular Walmart, uh, the, the price action this morning is justified. .Walmart was talking about raising prices. Does Target need to do the same? .Um, Target needs to in, in the sense that input costs are going to be up for tariffs. They have a larger tariff exposure than even Walmart, but Target's in a trickier position because their assortment is a little bit more expensive and it may be priced too highly to begin with. So it's a little bit harder for them to go and raise prices when the consumer doesn't seem to love their price points to begin with. Right? So they're in a trickier kind of in between a rock and a hard place where yes, they will have to raise the prices to offset input cost inflation, but consumers are already not thrilled with their price points today. .And, and it's interesting because given the uncertainty in the macro environment, Amy Wu Silverman telling me earlier this week, this is a moment where investors are betting on management versus companies overall. Is this a moment then where Brian Cornell's leadership comes into question? .Uh, he's managed a lot of different volatile periods. So he has experience in, in these difficult periods. But I, what I would say is they keep talking about longer term, we feel great about the growth opportunities, we feel great about the, the profit opportunities, uh, but they haven't grown over the last four years, right? They haven't basically grown since 2021 and profitability is about half of what it was. So maybe longer term it's out there, but I would consider four years part of the longer term and, and they haven't had it materialize. Um, they're in a tricky position where they need to catch up to Walmart and that requires a lot of spending and they don't quite have the ammunition available for spending. Um, this goes back a few years, but in that 2021, 2022 period, they went and did 10 billion plus in share buybacks. Uh, the stock is, you know, down more than 50% since they did the 10 billion buybacks, so they, they lost a lot of money on that, on those share repurchases. Uh, but more importantly, that 10 billion would have been wonderful to invest behind the business back then on, on the technology initiatives behind pricing. Invest some of that 10 billion four years ago behind pricing and they would be in a much better spot today to compete than they are. .Bill, I was taking a look at a note from Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk this morning saying that up to 10% of households in May 2025 could face a steep decline in their credit score because of what we know has been coming for a while in this student loan repayment cliff essentially. As you're thinking about that, does Target have a more outsized student loan repayment issue and problem on its hands given its mix and the overall inventory it has? .I, I, I think you're yes. Um, and I think you're right, it, it does come down to the mix. They just sell more discretionary product than a lot of the other retailers I cover, right? They sell more discretionary things you don't necessarily need uh, items. They sell more than Walmart, they obviously sell more than the, the pure food retailers like Kroger and Albertsons. So from a mix perspective relative to those names, yes, they, they would have more exposure to any sort of tightening of the budget because those discretionary items are the first thing to go. Uh, you know, they go before discretionary experiences. People don't like to cut travel and experience on the discretionary side, but they will cut discretionary physical, tangible items.

Walmart (WMT), however, maintained its full-year outlook, holding steady with 3–4% growth expected. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Morning Brief to break down why Walmart is pulling ahead, from product mix to pricing power..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..A tale of two retailers, when looking at Walmart and Target, Target shares sinking after cutting its forecast and warning on the impact of tariffs. Meanwhile, its rival Walmart maintained its full year outlook and expects sales to grow between three and four percent here with more on how Walmart pulled ahead of Target is Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DePalma here. Brooke, what have you assessed? .Yeah, good morning to you both. This is certainly a tale of two very different retailers. We know that Target really struggled to find its footing, especially as it faced that backlash from the pullback of diversity, equity, inclusion initiatives. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to attract customers with their key grocery category. Look break down in three parts, same source sales growth, their guidance, and then also that product mix. Taking a closer look at same source sales growth. What we heard from Target is that they reversed that same source sales momentum that they saw with a decline of 3.8%, far different than what Walmart US store with saw with an increase in same store sales growth. And as you can see here, this is really a trend that we've been seeing over the past say two and a half years since inflation peaked in the second half of 2022 as consumers really focused on wanting low prices and value for their money. Now, what this has led to today is this guidance outlook that Target has set. Essentially cutting their outlook for 2025, they now expect a low single digit decline in sales, that's down from 1% in the previous quarter they had said, while Walmart, they reiterated albeit conservative guidance. They now project sales to increase between 3% to 4%. Why is this all happening? Walmart's product mix is winning. We know that for a fact, one analyst telling me that Walmart is better positioned for traffic consistency. What's bringing in traffic? Groceries. Walmart's business is made up of 60% groceries. They also have about 10% coming from health and wellness and that remaining 30% is general merchandise. It's a far different story than what Target's offering here. We know that just 20% of what Target's offering is food followed by 10% beauty, 15% essentials, 15% apparel, 20% home, and 20% hard goods. Like think toys, think baby strollers. And essentially those are the items that in this sort of environment consumers are saying we could do without. .Well, Brooke, it makes me wonder too a little bit more about the pricing pressure of these companies. If product mix is such a concern, who can maybe win on price? What are we hearing from both Target and Walmart in terms of the tariff impact on their pricing power? .Yeah, just Thursday, Walmart came out their earnings and they made this big splash saying that they are going to have to raise prices because of tariffs. Of course that was met with backlash over the weekend from President Trump and now Target, not so quick to say that they're going to raise prices. In fact, they were very, you know, they declined to say whether or exactly they will have to raise prices. They did say that pricing is a very dynamic part of their business, that they're going to constantly have to adjust. They also said that they're looking to mitigate price changes by bringing or rather sourcing more products from the US instead of China. But what we remember is that this time last year, Target made that huge splash that they were rolling back prices. We saw that reverse and seems source sales growth in the middle of the year. And now at the end of last year, they said that 10,000 goods they were able to lower prices on. Because of these tariffs, the reality is, it's going to hit retailers margins if they don't in fact use mitigation strategies, one of them being higher prices. .Yeah, and that's certainly something that we heard from Bill Kirk as well. Brooke, thank you so much for bringing us your reporting. Really appreciate you breaking down the differences and similarities between those retailers.

Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years..With $105.9 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Target is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there are only a finite number of places to build new stores, making it harder to find incremental growth. To accelerate sales, Target likely needs to optimize its pricing or lean into international expansion..As you can see below, Target’s sales grew at a tepid 5.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) as it didn’t open many new stores..This quarter, Target missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 2.8% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $23.85 billion of revenue.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-nyse-tgt-misses-q1-103648964.html,Market Risk   Credit Risk   Reputation Risk   Operational Risk

A low P/E ratio and a generous, rising dividend could make Target stock a worthwhile pick.  Risk-averse investors often avoid individual stocks, even those of well-established, slow-growth companies like Target (NYSE: TGT).","Target stock has fallen by 63% from its 2021 high..A low P/E ratio and a generous, rising dividend could make Target stock a worthwhile pick..10 stocks we like better than Target ›.Risk-averse investors often avoid individual stocks, even those of well-established, slow-growth companies like Target (NYSE: TGT). Indeed, no stock is risk-free, and even the top retailers cannot completely rule out the possibility of failure, even in the case of an established company like Target..However, investors have several options for mitigating the worst effects of such possibilities, and with that, may have some incentive to take a chance on Target. Here's why investors should buy shares regardless of their risk tolerance, even if it could bring some initial discomfort if the stock falls further..Admittedly, fears of falling stock prices are understandable given Target's performance over the last few years. The stock has dropped by nearly 40% over the past 12 months, and it's down 63% from its peak in 2021..Tepid consumer demand has weighed on the stock, especially since, for a discount retailer, it tends to sell higher-end items compared to Dollar General or Walmart, for example. The company has also faced rising supply chain and digital fulfillment costs. The broad uncertainties revolving around new U.S. tariffs have likely put further strains on its supply chain..Further, Target has managed to alienate some of its customers over its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, regardless of the stance it takes. Boycotts from the right over the chain's Pride merchandise contributed to a net sales decline in 2023. Net sales fell further in 2024. Then Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, which prompted Target in early 2025 to abandon its DEI initiatives and retreat from its prior stance of advocacy for racial and social justice. That sparked backlash and boycotts from left-leaning groups, which some view as the reason for the chain's steady declines in foot traffic since they began..Nonetheless, investors have good reason to look at Target stock as a bargain rather than a falling knife. Politically motivated boycotts of companies tend not to last; the chain is likely to attract customers back as the political sentiment abates..Also, Target operates nearly 2,000 stores across all 50 states, meaning it competes in most markets. Also, while its 0.1% comparable sales increase for fiscal 2024 was far from impressive, it at least indicates that the company continued to hold its own competitively. Thus, it is far too early to rule out a more robust recovery for the chain if business conditions improve.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-target-excellent-high-risk-100900294.html,market risk   financial risk   dividend risk

These initiatives align with Target's strategic expansion in digital marketplaces and improved customer experiences, which could bolster margins over time. However, over the past five years, Target's total shareholder return, inclusive of share price and dividends, saw a 5.53% decline, contrasting the recent positive movement..While Target's one-year return underperformed the broader US market, which gained 11.7%, and the US Consumer Retailing industry, which rose 32%, the company remains focused on enhancing its digital and in-store capabilities. The effect of these initiatives on revenue and earnings projections is evident, with analysts forecasting earnings growth from US$4.1 billion to US$4.6 billion by May 2028. Still, economic factors might challenge these targets.

Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Michael Baker sits down with Catalysts host Madison Mills and her guest host, Tematica Research CIO Chris Versace, to speak more about Home Depot's guidance and earnings expectations for other major retailers..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here..So, tracking that momentum is going to be key for investors. What are some of the things that you'll be watching, you know, in the next several weeks, several months throughout the summer to kind of get a feel that that guidance is tracking? .Sure. Well, we have a number of leading indicators that we track on an inter quarter basis and, and publish frequently. This is things like overall retail sales. We spend a lot of time looking at their vendors, a lot of their publicly traded vendors report a month before Home Depot does because they have a December year end, whereas uh, Home Depot has a January year end. So we hear from Stanley Black & Decker, Masco, et cetera. That gives us good insight. We do get weekly uh, point of sales data. So there's a lot of stuff that we track and we, and we publish on and that really does help us get a sense as to whether uh, they're tracking in line or not and if we see things waver, uh, we'll adjust accordingly. .And, and Michael, I also want to look ahead to some of the other retail earnings that we have coming up, particularly when it comes to a company like Costco. How are you thinking about that retailer in this moment? .Well, Costco is doing exceptionally well. We know that. Uh, remember Costco is the only retailer still that still gives us monthly comps. So we have a very good sense as to how they're comping uh, into quarters. So, so when they report it, it's really about margins. Uh, but when we look at the, the, the, the monthly comps, uh, they're just taking a lot of share. Uh, really all the clubs are doing well. Sam's Club within the Walmart um, uh, uh, report last week was very strong. BJ's has been taking market share. Uh, in fact, BJ's has been one of the best performing stocks in, in our space year to date. BJ's stock is up more than Costco's. Uh, but all three of them are doing very well that the club space in general just taking market share uh, in an environment where consumers are, are really focused on value. .And I guess I wonder if you can kind of put a bow on all of this for me here, especially as we head towards Target earnings. How are we going to see retailers sort of entering either the Walmart camp of admitting to raising prices versus the Home Depot camp of saying we're going to keep prices where they are and what are the factors that you think different retailers are going to consider as they're deciding which camp to signal that they're going to be in to investors. .Well, well, it's very tricky and you're right, to me it's much more about signaling. I don't really think those two companies, Home Depot and Walmart, are doing things that much differently. It's just how it's articulated. Uh, I think Walmart wants to send a, a message uh, perhaps to the administration that, you know, some prices will go up uh, and, and, and so uh, try to help with the tariff negotiations, if you will, telling the administration that we really need some help on, on tariffs. But again, I, Walmart also use a portfolio effect and in some areas prices will go up, some, some will go down and I think it'll be about neutral. Uh, but, but really it's just about how much you want to sort of signal to the administration and, and Home Depot just seems to be taking a, a more conservative approach to that, uh, Walmart a little bit more aggressive. How other companies do it? You know, Walmart really has the size, the scale, the credibility, whatever you want to call it to, to, to, to, to really articulate that a little bit more effectively than, than I think some smaller retailers. That being said, smaller retailers, they might not have a choice. They might have to raise prices because they don't really have the offsets that the bigger retailers with scale have, i.e. pushing some of the uh, tariffs back onto their suppliers.

Here’s what you need to know..Target met analysts’ revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $30.92 billion, down 3.1% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts’ gross margin estimates but a miss of analysts’ EBITDA estimates..Is Target a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it’s free..This quarter, analysts are expecting Target’s revenue to be flat year on year at $24.41 billion, improving from the 3.1% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.67 per share..Analysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Target has missed Wall Street’s revenue estimates four times over the last two years..Looking at Target’s peers in the non-discretionary retail segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Walmart delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5%, meeting analysts’ expectations, and Sprouts reported revenues up 18.7%, topping estimates by 1.4%.

The stock, which has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, has an average price target of $117.54, suggesting upside of nearly 20% from its closing level Friday..Target is expected to report Q1 earnings per share of $1.64 on revenue that edged lower to $24.41 billion. Comparable store sales are expected to have fallen 1.5%, though some analysts have warned that the metric could have declined 4%..Last quarter, Target reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but warned that tariffs and worsening consumer sentiment were likely to affect its future performance..In a note leading up to the retailer's report, JPMorgan analysts wrote that they believe Target is likely to lower its full-year sales and profit forecasts, but said they ""remain on the positive side of the company's long-term relevance to the consumer."".Morgan Stanley analysts also expect lowered guidance, as ""sales have likely decelerated further YTD, due to a combination of weaker consumer sentiment, overall slowdown in discretionary categories (to which TGT overindexes, compared to its broadline peers), and TGT-specific execution challenges."".Despite the near-term weakness, Oppenheimer said they ""would take advantage of any dips"" as they remain bullish on Target's long-term trajectory. UBS analysts, meanwhile, said that Target ""needs to stabilize its market share, define its positioning in the market, demonstrate the sustainability of its profitability, and showcase its ability to harvest suitable returns."".Read the original article on Investopedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-think-target-stock-ahead-174200840.html,market risk

Pivots on tariff and trade policy, shifting outlooks on interest rate policies, corporate earnings of varying quality, and other factors have all combined to create a stretch of nearly unprecedented volatility for stocks..While the broader market has enjoyed some strong rebound trading lately, there are still many stocks trading at huge discounts compared to their previous highs. If you're looking for investment plays with huge rebound potential, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that taking a buy-and-hold approach to these beaten-down stocks would be a great move right now..Jennifer Saibil (Target): Target (NYSE: TGT) has experienced so many challenges over the past few years that it's hard to keep up. So it isn't surprising that its stock has absolutely tumbled and is now 63% off of its all-time highs. But it's an excellent buying opportunity for the smart investor..Results have been tepid at Target recently, with sales and comparable sales roughly flat in fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 1). But the company's 1,800+ U.S. stores continue to draw traffic from loyal customers, and there were many signs of life. Traffic was up 1.4% for the year, which means people are still coming to shop at Target, and there's strength in the digital program -- same-day services increased 25% year over year in the fourth quarter..Full-year earnings per share were $8.86, and there's plenty of cash on the balance sheet, so there aren't any worries about Target's ability to keep operating..Part of the problem is that unlike competing retailers Walmart and Costco Wholesale, both of which have large grocery departments, Target's core segments are discretionary items, which customers will naturally cut back on when they're trying to save money. The company is well-positioned to get back to higher growth when the economy is in better shape..Finally, Target has recently become a Dividend King, an exclusive status given to a small group of stocks that have raised their dividends for 50 straight years. Target is now on year 53, which means it has raised its dividend since 1971, and it has kept up its streak through the dot-com bubble, financial crisis, hyperinflation, a global pandemic, and other events.

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD, Lowe's LOW and Deckers Outdoors DECK..The market wasn't particularly excited about Walmart's earnings results last Thursday, but we think the retail leader did an excellent job in an otherwise challenging operating environment..The positives of the Walmart report were better-than-expected comps, the company's domestic ecommerce business turning profitable for the first time, and its ability to provide guidance despite the all-around operating uncertainty..On the negative side, Walmart's 'general merchandise' comps were 'slightly negative', with weakness in electronics, home, and sporting goods offsetting positive momentum from toys, automotive, and kids apparel. Management had told the investor community about this category's soft start to the quarter at the April investor meeting, with trends improving later in the period..The general merchandise category has been weak post-COVID, with some early signs of life in recent quarters.

Other major retailers reporting results this week include Home Depot, Lowe's, Deckers Outdoors and others..Target shares have been big-time laggards lately, with the stock losing more than a quarter of its value this year, handily lagging the broader market (flat in the year-to-date period) and Walmart (up more than +8%)..Target is expected to report $1.68 in EPS on $24.42 billion in sales, representing year-over-year changes of -17.2% and -0.47%. Estimates for the period have been steadily on a downtrend, with today's $1.68 estimate down from $1.74 a week ago and $1.81 two months back. Same-store sales are expected to be down -1.7% this period, which would compare to +1.5% in the preceding quarter and +0.3% in the quarter before that..In addition to continued weak demand trends for Target's discretionary-heavy merchandise, these products also tend to be more trade-exposed relative to food and other traditional grocery merchandise. Walmart claims that two-thirds of its merchandise is domestically sourced, limiting its exposure to the unsettled tariff situation.

Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social..""We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won't stop. We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,"" a Walmart spokesperson told Yahoo Finance..Walmart CEO Doug McMillon was among the CEOs who met with the president in late April to discuss tariff implications. A person familiar with the discussions told Yahoo Finance Walmart made a case to remove tariffs on China altogether as even lower tariffs would have major implications on prices for general merchandise items such as furniture and toys..The Trump administration and China agreed to dial back tariffs for 90 days last week. The US tariff rate on China now sits at 30%, down from 145% at the height of the trade tussle between the economic superpowers..""Low prices is what we stand for, and we're going to keep prices as low as we can as long as we can,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey said on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts (video above) this week following the company's first quarter earnings. ""But when you look at the magnitude of some of the cost increases on certain categories of items that are imported, it's more than what retailers can bear. It's more than what suppliers can bear."".""And so we'll work hard to try to keep prices low. But it's unavoidable that you're going to see some prices go up on certain items."".Rainey said increases will be noticeable later this month..Rainey added, ""Well, if you've got a 30% tariff on something, you're likely going to see double digits [in price increases]."".The most impacted areas for Walmart will include baby strollers, furniture, and toys. Price hikes in these departments could major impacts on suppliers such as Newell Brands (NWL), reports Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma..Walmart's earnings day was mixed as shoppers spent somewhat cautiously given the greater economic uncertainty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-should-eat-the-tariffs-trump-says-after-retailer-warns-of-looming-price-hikes-155126753.html,**Operational Risk**   **Reputational Risk**   **Market Risk**

What can investors expect?","The market wasn’t particularly excited about Walmart’s WMT results last Thursday, but we think the retail leader did an excellent job in an otherwise challenging operating environment..The positives of the Walmart report were better-than-expected comps, the company’s domestic ecommerce business turning profitable for the first time, and its ability to provide guidance despite the all-around operating uncertainty..On the negative side, Walmart’s ‘general merchandise’ comps were ‘slightly negative’, with weakness in electronics, home, and sporting goods offsetting positive momentum from toys, automotive, and kids apparel. Management had told the investor community about this category's soft start to the quarter at the April investor meeting, with trends improving later in the period..The general merchandise category has been weak post-COVID, with some early signs of life in recent quarters. But the Walmart results show that the near-term outlook for this category is unlikely to improve in any meaningful way soon. This is a net negative for Target TGT, which has a much bigger exposure to this category than Walmart..Target will report quarterly results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 21st. Other major retailers reporting results this week include Home Depot HD, Lowe’s LOW, Deckers Outdoors DECK, and others..Target shares have been big-time laggards lately, with the stock losing more than a quarter of its value this year, handily lagging the broader market (flat in the year-to-date period) and Walmart (up more than +8%). The chart below shows the one-year performance of Target shares (down -38.2%) relative to Walmart (up +51.6%).Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Target is expected to report $1.68 in EPS on $24.42 billion in sales, representing year-over-year changes of -17.2% and -0.47%. Estimates for the period have been steadily on a downtrend, with today’s $1.68 estimate down from $1.74 a week ago and $1.81 two months back. Same-store sales are expected to be down -1.7% this period, which would compare to +1.5% in the preceding quarter and +0.3% in the quarter before that..In addition to continued weak demand trends for Target’s discretionary-heavy merchandise, these products also tend to be more trade-exposed relative to food and other traditional grocery merchandise. Walmart claims that two-thirds of its merchandise is domestically sourced, limiting its exposure to the unsettled tariff situation. Between Walmart and Target, the latter is far more vulnerable to the unfavorable global trade regime.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-earnings-continue-target-home-004200669.html,market risk

198,2025-05-16 20:47:00,How Should Investors Approach Walmart Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,"WMT's Q1 results and strategic growth areas reinforce long-term strength, but challenges like tariffs and currency headwinds cloud short-term visibility.","Walmart Inc. WMT reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2026 results. However, the market responded cautiously with shares falling 0.5% on Thursday after the earnings announcement. Despite year-over-year growth in both revenues and earnings that surpassed forecasts, management cautioned that rising tariffs will lead to higher prices as the retailer passes on increased costs to customers..Walmart’s fiscal first-quarter results reinforced its position as a leading omnichannel retailer. Total revenues rose 2.5% year over year to $165.61 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at 61 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. (Read: Walmart Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, E-Commerce Growth Supports Sales)The company’s e-commerce segment was the standout performer, growing 22% globally. Growth was fueled by strong demand for store-fulfilled pickup, delivery, and marketplace services. Walmart’s emphasized that its omni-channel strategy continues to gain relevance in today’s dynamic retail environment. By the end of the quarter, Walmart U.S. had expanded sub-three-hour delivery options to 93% of households. Retail giants such as Kroger KR, Target TGT and Costco COST are also advancing in omnichannel strategies, underscoring the industry’s pivot toward this model.Coming back to Walmart, it is also making significant progress in high-growth revenue streams. Advertising revenues soared 50%, and membership income climbed 14.8% in the fiscal first quarter. These segments — alongside marketplace services — helped lift the consolidated gross profit margin by 12 basis points (bps) to 24.2%. The margin gains were primarily driven by Walmart U.S., supported by improved inventory management, fewer markdowns, and a more profitable product mix.However, currency headwinds remain a persistent drag on performance. In the fiscal first quarter alone, unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced reported sales by $2.4 billion. If these exchange rates hold, management expects a 120 basis-point hit to reported revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter..Despite a strong start to the year, Walmart acknowledged potential hurdles in the coming quarters. The company withheld the EPS guidance for second-quarter fiscal 2026, citing ongoing uncertainty, especially related to tariffs and a highly fluid economic environment. These tariff costs, even at reduced levels, are expected to push prices higher in the near term.Nevertheless, Walmart reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The company expects fiscal 2026 revenues to grow by 3% to 4% (at constant currency), and adjusted operating income to rise between 3.5% and 5.5%. Adjusted EPS is forecasted in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, compared with last year’s $2.51.Although short-term challenges, such as tariffs and foreign exchange fluctuations, may impact Walmart’s near-term results, the company’s growing e-commerce presence, strong value proposition, and expansion into high-margin areas, including advertising and memberships, position it strongly in the retail sector. Walmart’s long-term fundamentals remain robust, even as its short-term outlook faces some uncertainty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-approach-walmart-stock-post-124700960.html,market risk   operational risk   currency risk   trade policy risk
