2025-06-27 03:00:00,Alibaba Just Released New AI Models for Apple. Does That Make AAPL Stock a Buy?,"Apple needs China, and Alibaba just helped unlock its AI future with the Qwen3 model. Is this the catalyst AAPL bulls were waiting for?","For Apple (AAPL), artificial intelligence is the key to future-proofing its robust devices and services ecosystem. Yet in China, Apple’s second-largest market, the company’s AI ambitions have hit a wall. Between trade tensions, strict regulations, Beijing’s data-localization demands, fierce competition for device sales, Apple’s Intelligence suite remained locked out of the mainland..Alibaba Group (BABA) has just handed Apple a potential key. Its Qwen3 AI models have been fine-tuned for Apple’s MLX framework, enabling them to run natively on iPhones, iPads, and Macs..Tesla’s Robotaxis Reportedly Sped and Veered Into the Wrong Lanes. Does This Crush the Bull Case for TSLA Stock?.1 Dividend Stock to Buy Yielding Over 7%.Ditch Big Tech and Buy These 3 Popular Stocks in 2025 Instead.Get exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else..It is a strategic play. Apple needs a domestic AI partner to navigate China’s tight controls, and Alibaba’s open-source route gives it both flexibility and local legitimacy. This could finally pave the road for Apple Intelligence to launch in China - a much-needed boost for iPhone sales..Nearly six months into 2025, and Apple bulls are still bruised, with shares 23% off their peak. So, will this Alibaba alliance reignite the rally or trigger more turbulence?.Apple (AAPL), the $3 trillion global tech titan from Cupertino, redefined technology with the iPhone, Mac, and iPad. But its real power play now is the services segment. With over a billion paid subscribers and high-margin offerings like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, it is weathering global headwinds while tightening its grip on the digital ecosystem..Despite being big on innovation, AAPL’s stock has slumped 19.5% in 2025, making Apple the worst YTD performer among the Magnificent Seven. Regulatory headwinds and mounting competition have eroded investor confidence. While large-cap tech rebounded in May, Apple missed the rally and dropped 6% that month alone. The decline deepened with rising tariff tensions, especially fears of a 25% hit if Apple doesn’t shift manufacturing to the U.S..Yet the core issue extends beyond geopolitics and trade friction. “Apple Intelligence” debuted at WWDC 2024, failed to generate lasting enthusiasm, hindered by limited device compatibility and the postponement of key features like the enhanced Siri. Legal pressures and underwhelming developments at WWDC 2025, where cosmetic updates overshadowed bold innovation, further reinforced perceptions that Apple is trailing AI leaders such as Google (GOOGL). While the company’s ecosystem remains robust, its current AI narrative lacks the momentum to inspire market confidence.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-just-released-ai-models-190002370.html," The risk classification for the news about Alibaba releasing new AI models for Apple is Medium Risk.  **Rationale:**  - **Potential Supply Chain Dependency:** The release introduces reliance on Alibaba, which could pose risks if there are issues or reputational problems with the vendor.  - **Diversification Benefits:** While relying on multiple vendors like Alibaba can mitigate risks compared to sole dependence, it still carries inherent risks in a supply chain context.  - **Competitive Landscape:** With competitors like Google and Microsoft also working on AI models, the risk is somewhat mitigated by market competition but isn't entirely neutralized.  - **Market Sentiment and Reaction:** The impact will depend on investor reactions. Positive sentiment could boost AAPL's stock, while concern over dependency could have the opposite effect.  - **Technical Considerations:** The significance of Qwen3 determines its value; incremental improvements might reduce perceived risk compared to substantial innovation.  - **Broader Trends:** If part of a larger strategic investment by Alibaba, it could indicate long-term importance, affecting AAPL's risk profile but without specific context, it's considered medium.  Overall, the news introduces noticeable risks but isn't classified as high or low risk."

The latest iterations, ERNIE 4.5 and X1 Turbo, demonstrate remarkable progress in both reasoning and multimodal capabilities. Yet the key question remains: Is ERNIE alone enough to anchor Baidu’s broader AI strategy?There is no denying the model’s technical strength. ERNIE now powers a growing share of Baidu’s product ecosystem, including Gen AI-enhanced search, intelligent digital humans and its Qianfan model-as-a-service platform. These efforts are already translating into commercial success, AI Cloud revenues surged 42% year over year in first-quarter 2025, now accounting for 26% of Baidu Core revenues.However, Baidu’s AI strategy is clearly broader than just the ERNIE model itself. The company’s strength lies in its end-to-end AI stack, combining infrastructure, models, applications and tools. Importantly, it is adopting an application-driven approach, optimizing model development around real-world use cases, not academic benchmarks.Open-sourcing ERNIE 4.5 later this year indicates Baidu’s confidence, but also a strategic hedge. In a fiercely competitive AI landscape, where rivals offer chatbots and foundation models of their own, openness and flexibility can drive developer adoption.So, while ERNIE is the engine, it is Baidu’s integrated AI ecosystem, Qianfan, agents, digital humans and Apollo Go, that fuels the real ambition. On its own, ERNIE may not be enough. But as part of Baidu’s full-stack AI playbook, this could be more than enough to keep it at the forefront of China’s AI race..Baidu’s ERNIE may be at the forefront of China’s AI-foundation model race, but Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA and Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY are formidable challengers building out their own AI ecosystems.Alibaba, through the Cloud Intelligence Group, has been pushing hard with its Tongyi Qianwen model series. Integrated deeply into enterprise SaaS, cloud services and consumer-facing platforms like DingTalk, Alibaba’s model strategy emphasizes versatility and ecosystem embedding. The company’s enterprise scale and cloud dominance give it distribution power that Baidu must match through Qianfan and strategic partnerships.Tencent, meanwhile, is leveraging its massive user base and gaming, social and content platforms to deploy Hunyuan, its own large model. The company focuses more on AI-as-a-service and verticalized applications across entertainment, finance and healthcare. While Baidu leads in full-stack AI infrastructure, Tencent’s reach and monetization pathways pose a real challenge.To stay ahead, Baidu must keep differentiating ERNIE with cost-efficient performance, rapid iteration and real-world applications at scale.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidus-ai-push-gains-momentum-150300279.html," The news relates to Baidu's AI-Push gaining momentum with the ERNIE model. However, based on the analysis, there are multiple risks involved:  1. **Competitive Risk**: Baidu may face competition from global giants like Google in the AI space. 2. **Economic Risk**: Reliance on global markets and cloud services could be affected by economic downturns or trade policies. 3. **Regulatory Risk**: Potential issues with data privacy and bias in their AI models. 4. **Technological Risk**: Dependency on emerging AI technology that may not sustain long-term growth. 5. **Financial Risk**: Revenue reliance on a single ecosystem could lead to financial instability if the sector underperforms.  These risks collectively pose challenges for Baidu's growth strategy."

According to Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap, the results were “encouraging” and suggest Alibaba’s e-commerce operations may be regaining momentum following several quarters of muted growth. Yap reaffirmed her Buy rating on Alibaba Group Holdings Limited (NYSE:BABA) and maintained a $169 price target, which implies nearly 50% upside from current trading levels. She noted that the strong GMV results could support a positive surprise in CMR performance, which remains a critical driver of Alibaba’s profitability..While macroeconomic uncertainties and regulatory overhangs have weighed on Chinese tech stocks, the 6.18 results offer a potential turning point for investor sentiment.

2025-06-25 21:30:00,Is Alibaba (BABA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,"Based on the average brokerage recommendation (ABR), Alibaba (BABA) should be added to one's portfolio. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations cast doubt on the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric. So, is the stock worth buying?","Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?.Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alibaba (BABA)..Alibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.14 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 90.9% and 4.6% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>.The ABR suggests buying Alibaba, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation..Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation..In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-baba-buy-wall-street-133003217.html," The news pertains to **Market Sentiment Risk** as Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations, potentially leading to overvaluation due to reliance on metrics without comprehensive context.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on BABA. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA)'s share was trading at $112.87 as of 13th June. BABA’s trailing and forward P/E were 15.15 and 11.34 respectively according to Yahoo Finance..A close-up of a customer using the company's e-commerce platform whilst shopping online..Alibaba’s current valuation presents a deeply compelling opportunity when anchored to fundamentals. At the core lies Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG), China’s dominant e-commerce platform, which despite fierce competition, maintains a 44% EBITDA margin and robust cash generation. Assuming a conservative 3% annual revenue growth—well below China’s nominal GDP trajectory—and flat margins, TTG is projected to generate RMB 150 billion in earnings over the next 12 months. Applying an 18x multiple to this muted base case yields a valuation of RMB 2700 billion (USD $376B), exceeding Alibaba’s entire market cap of RMB 1953 billion (USD $272B)..This implies investors are effectively paying for TTG at a 28% discount, while receiving all other assets—Ant Group, international commerce, logistics, and notably, the Cloud Intelligence Group—for free..That cloud segment is seeing a marked inflection. Historically stymied by regulatory and cost barriers, China's cloud adoption is now accelerating as generative AI creates a structural demand shift. Alibaba Cloud, already the market leader with 36% share, benefits from deep integration across commerce, proprietary AI tools (Qwen LLMs), and a hyperscale GPU infrastructure..In Q1 FY25, cloud revenue surged 18% YoY—the strongest pace since 2021—driven by AI workloads and disciplined pricing. With the market forecasted to grow at 20% CAGR through 2030, Alibaba Cloud’s path to RMB 717 billion (~$100B) revenue by 2035 is increasingly credible..In sum, Alibaba offers a high-quality, cash-generative core business at a discount, with free upside optionality in cloud, AI, and fintech—an asymmetric opportunity for long-term investors..Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Alibaba by Kontra Investments in March 2025, emphasizing a rebound in Taobao/Tmall and cloud growth amid rising AI demand, despite fierce pricing competition. The thesis by Modern Value Investing deepens the valuation case—arguing that Alibaba’s core e-commerce business alone justifies its market cap, effectively giving investors free exposure to its cloud, fintech, and international assets.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-202550387.html, **Risk Classification:** Market Volatility and Potential Bubble Formation

The Zacks Internet - Services industry has declined 0.9% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to robust growth in its merchant base driven by its merchant-friendly tools, including Shop Pay, Shopify Pay Instalments, Sign in with Shop and the Shop App. The strong adoption of these solutions holds promise for Shopify’s prospects.In the first quarter of 2025, Merchant Solutions’ revenues were $1.74 billion and accounted for 73.7% of Shopify’s total revenues.

Same-store sales growth from existing merchants, a higher number of merchants on SHOP’s platform and strong international growth drove GMV in the reported quarter..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.SHOP’s expanding portfolio has been a major growth driver for its success. Its merchant-friendly tool Shop Pay stands out as a key driver. The app processed $22 billion in Gross Merchandise Value in the first quarter of 2025, up 57% year over year. Large brands like Birkenstock, Lilly Pulitzer, and Johnny Was adopted Shop Pay, enhancing Shopify’s portfolio.Further expanding its portfolio Shopify recently partnered with Coinbase and Stripe to enable merchants worldwide to accept USDC stablecoin payments through Shopify Payments.

We can see that retail investors own the lion's share in the company with 51% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company..And institutions on the other hand have a 44% ownership in the company. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies..In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Alibaba Group Holding.. See our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding .Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index..Alibaba Group Holding already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Alibaba Group Holding's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story..Alibaba Group Holding is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 5.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 3.7% and 3.3% of the stock..On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest..While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-limited-nyse-140016360.html, The news about Alibaba Group Holding Limited's significant ownership by retail investors is classified under a **Moderate Retail Investors' Exposure Risk** due to potential increased market volatility and investor sentiment fluctuations.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on MercadoLibre MELI, Amazon AMZN and Alibaba BABA..Here is a synopsis of all five stocks..It’s time to go digging for gold, literally. While the broader market has been jostling between interest rate anxiety and soft-landing optimism, the yellow metal has been stealthily consolidating gains. Meanwhile, there's one stock in the precious metals space that’s glimmering more than the rest.Today’s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Eldorado Gold, a mid-tier gold miner that’s setting itself up for a breakout year..Eldorado Gold is a Canadian-based gold and base metals producer with mining, development and exploration operations in Turkey, Canada, and Greece. While many of its peers overextend and overpromise, EGO has stayed lean, focused, and smart about where and how it digs..In a world where geopolitical risk is part of the game, Eldorado’s diversified asset base gives it a cushion. From the high-grade Lamaque mine in Quebec to the Skouries project in Greece, EGO is sitting on a resource base that’s about to deliver serious production upside..The reason for the favorable rank is that 4 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from $1.42 to $1.65 for the current year while next year’s number is up from $1.76 to $2.53..That means that next year’s earnings growth is forecast to come in at 53%. That’s on revenue growth forecasts of 19% this year and 36% next year..This growth is clearly illustrated in our Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart on Zacks.com. Estimates have gone from bottoming out in late 2023 to ticking higher until the start of this year, when estimates retreated a touch. They bottomed out at the start of Q3 and have been moving higher ever since. With geopolitical risk continuing despite talk of ceasefires and such, gold remains bid, helping the gold miners continue to shine..You ever walk into a grocery store and catch the smell of freshly baked bread? It’s a simple pleasure. But as investors, we have to separate that warm, comforting aroma from cold, hard earnings trends. That brings us to today’s Bear of the Day, Flowers Foods.

The company continues to enhance its online buying experience through better pricing, navigation and product selection, helping it outperform in key markets. Strong brand preference across Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile in the first quarter of 2025 highlights growing consumer trust in its marketplace and value proposition..MercadoLibre sees a significant runway for growth. Physical stores still represent around 85% of retail spend in the region, while MELI holds less than 5% share. In the first quarter, unique active buyers grew 25% year over year, driving strong FX-neutral GMV growth of 30% in Brazil, 23% in Mexico and 126% in Argentina. The company aims to raise purchase frequency and category penetration, especially in areas like supermarkets, to capture more of this opportunity..To support these goals, MELI is investing in user experience and infrastructure. Features like repeat purchase options and category-based navigation helped the supermarket category grow 65% year over year in the first quarter, outpacing all others. Logistics upgrades also played a key role. Fulfillment penetration in Brazil surpassed 60% in March, and rising scale is lowering per-order costs across regions, enabling strategic initiatives like free shipping..These improvements are translating into strong financial results.

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this online retailer have returned -6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..The consensus earnings estimate of $10.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.06 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-alibaba-group-130004427.html, Investment Risk

JD Retail continues to play a central role in helping shoppers access quality products at competitive prices while offering brands a powerful and supply-chain-backed platform for scale. With rising user activity, enhanced brand partnerships and deeper category penetration, JD Retail remains the backbone of JD.com’s long-term growth strategy..JD Retail is expanding in high-growth areas like supermarkets, fashion, and food delivery, while reinforcing its low-price strategy. With initiatives like the RMB 200 billion “export to domestic” program and strong momentum in food delivery, JD is confident that these moves will drive deeper engagement and support long-term growth..To support future growth, JD is accelerating AI adoption across its retail and fulfillment layers. From AI-powered shopping guides and personalized recommendations to automated ad targeting and fulfillment optimization, technology is driving efficiency and improving the experience for users and merchants.

2025-06-19 16:15:00,3 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term,"Look for businesses that are not only built to last, but with uniquely competitive goods and services.","Alibaba operates in a regional economic silo that benefits the company..The personal mobility space is changing in a way that favors Uber Technologies, but the biggest change is still ahead..Cisco is still the king of the networking market, but smaller and more specialized player Arista Networks has found a way to be incredibly competitive..10 stocks we like better than Alibaba Group ›.Are you looking for some new growth stocks now that many of the market's usual favorites -- like Apple and Alphabet -- aren't as compelling as they once were? Don't panic. Great stocks are out there. You just have to dig a bit deeper to find the best ones..With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three brilliant growth stock prospects worth stepping into and sticking with for the long haul. Each one has a business that's built to last indefinitely..There's the Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) you know. That's the Alibaba that owns and operates China's popular e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao, and its foreign-facing AliExpress that helps Chinese manufacturers sell to overseas customers. Within its home country, the company enjoys a commanding 40% of the online shopping market, according to wealth management outfit DBS Treasures..Then there's the Alibaba you don't know. This company also offers cloud computing services, operates a digital entertainment arm, and manages its own logistics/delivery business. It's even working on its own artificial intelligence models meant for consumer and corporate use. Remember the Qwen2.5 model unveiled in January that reportedly performed better than DeepSeek (which had only been revealed a few days earlier as a threat to platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT)? Alibaba is the developer of Qwen..All of these business lines are going to be marketable in the near and distant future, even if not explosively so. Alibaba's first-quarter revenue improved to the tune of 7% year over year, more or less matching its long-term top-line growth rate that's likely to remain in place for the indefinite future..But the tariff standoff between China and the United States that's creating a ripple effect outside of both countries? That's just it. Alibaba isn't particularly vulnerable..Don't misread the message. Anything that slows China's manufacturing exports ultimately threatens the nation's internal consumerism..It's not a dire threat, though. More than 80% of this company's revenue is generated domestically. And it's largely understood that Chinese companies are expected to use goods and services offered by other Chinese companies whenever there's a choice. Ditto for their foreign business partners. For instance, although Apple prefers OpenAI's ChatGPT everywhere else, in China, its newest AI-capable iPhones sold in that market will utilize Alibaba's Qwen model.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-brilliant-growth-stocks-buy-081500361.html, The article discusses growth stocks with long-term potential.

PDD, which was based originally in Shanghai, enjoys it’ largest market in China and operates under the Pinduoduo name. Meanwhile, PDD’s US and international businesses operate under the ‘Temu” umbrella. PDD has gained a foothold in several international markets by offering competitive and often cheaper prices than competitors such as JD.com (JD), Alibaba (BABA), and Amazon (AMZN)..In its Chinese market, another key differentiator for PDD Holdings is that it offers a group buying model that allows customers to unlock lower prices by encouraging family and friends also to purchase items. The team purchase model does this through an interactive and social shopping experience. In addition, PDD can often offer lower prices because it removes the middleman and connects users directly with agricultural producers, allowing the company to provide fresh, affordable produce. Beyond its e-commerce platform, PDD has vertically integrated its business with a vast network of sourcing, logistics, and fulfillment capabilities..Last quarter, PDD’s net profit plunged nearly 50%, and the company fell short of Zacks Consensus Estimates by an ugly 37%..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.PDD is suffering amid three major challenges, including:.·       Tariff Turmoil: PDD was one of the most adversely impacted businesses in the tit-for-tat tariff war between the US and China.Though tensions have cooled between the world’s two largest economies, the US still has a tariff on China of around 50%, likely making goods from the Temu website far more expensive for Americans..·       A Weak Chinese Economy: An ongoing housing crisis, rampant unemployment, and sluggish domestic consumption are all factors causing PDD’s Chinese business to suffer..·       Intense Competition: The Chinese e-commerce market is highly competitive. Though PDD missed estimates, JD beat estimates in the recent quarter – an ominous sign..PDD is not only suffering from sluggish demand but also weak profit margins.

JD’s future growth should all be about leveraging a battle-tested logistics network in areas like meal delivery, where it’s making headway despite initial losses, the founder said..“For JD, it’s a lost five years, to put it bluntly,” Liu said in comments published in Chinese media, which a company spokesperson later confirmed..“No innovation, no growth, no progress. It should be considered the most unremarkable and least-valuable five years in my entrepreneurial history,” Liu told reporters on the eve of JD’s signature June 18 shopping festival..In March, JD made an aggressive entry into China’s $80 billion-plus food delivery market, a long-dormant arena controlled by Meituan and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Ele.me..Liu personally handed out takeouts to customers during a publicity stunt, gave away 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in user subsidies, and promised above-industry benefits for his army of 100,000 delivery riders.

It plans to roll out its e-commerce platform in Europe in 2026, after three years of building infrastructure there. On its home turf, the company will challenge Meituan in another key market — hotel and flight bookings — offering a three-year membership program that waives commissions for hotels..Meituan founder Wang Xing was among the guests at a recent dinner Liu hosted for tech founders, the JD chief said. “I told him straight up, ‘bro, we’re making a move into food delivery.’”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jd-com-billionaire-unveils-turnaround-044851177.html," The risk classification is high due to potential market entry challenges, competition from Meituan, regulatory changes, economic factors, and geopolitical issues."

Apple Intelligence encompasses various AI tools, including Genmoji and Writing Tools, which require local partnership to comply with Chinese regulations. The partnership has gained strategic importance as Apple's iPhone sales captured the top position in China during May, with global sales rising 15% year over year in April and May according to Counterpoint Research data.However, the collaboration faces mounting pressure from U.S. officials who have been scrutinizing the arrangement. Reports indicate that White House and congressional officials are examining Apple's plans to integrate Alibaba's AI technology into iPhones sold in China, reflecting broader tensions in U.S.-China technology relations. This scrutiny introduces uncertainty about the partnership's timeline and ultimate implementation, potentially affecting both companies' strategic plans in the crucial Chinese market..Alibaba's fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results presented a mixed picture that disappointed investors. Total revenues reached RMB 236.5 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth, though this figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.49%. The company's adjusted EBITA showed stronger performance with 36% year-over-year growth to RMB 32.6 billion, indicating operational efficiency improvements.The Taobao and Tmall Group demonstrated resilience with customer management revenues growing 12% year over year, primarily driven by improved take rates. Meanwhile, the Cloud Intelligence Group accelerated growth to 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This cloud performance underscores the potential value of the Apple partnership, though regulatory uncertainties may limit near-term benefits.However, various business segments showed mixed results, with some areas like Cainiao Smart Logistics experiencing revenue declines due to operational restructuring.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicates a downward revision of 1.5% over the past 60 days to $10.62 per share, the market appears to be pessimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baba-down-8-month-partnership-155900688.html," The news pertains to financial market sentiment regarding Alibaba's stock performance and potential regulatory risks associated with a partnership involving Apple.

Each is leaning into AI to help drive growth for cloud computing and e-commerce businesses that both companies operate..Let's see which stock is the better buy..Alibaba has been working hard to turn around its core e-commerce business. It has been investing heavily in Tmall and Taobao to reaccelerate gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth and is now beginning to monetize that higher GMV more effectively through a small software fee and its AI-powered marketing tool, Quanzhantui. Last quarter, its e-commerce revenue rose 9% year over year, while third-party revenue jumped 12%. More importantly, segment earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) climbed 8%..At the same time, Alibaba is seeing strong momentum in its cloud computing business. Its Cloud Intelligence segment revenue increased by 18% year over year last quarter, as AI-related revenue more than doubled for the seventh consecutive quarter. Impressively, its adjusted EBITA surged by 69%, demonstrating the segment's strong operating leverage..Alibaba's AI push is being driven by its Qwen series of models. In addition to a strong foundation model, it's rolled out versions specifically built for tasks like coding and math. Its latest release, Qwen3, is a new class of ""hybrid reasoning"" models that combine traditional large language model capabilities with more advanced, dynamic reasoning. Meanwhile, Alibaba scored a huge win earlier this year when Apple chose its models to power Apple Intelligence in China, although the deal has been delayed by Chinese regulators. Nonetheless, it's a clear sign that Alibaba's AI efforts are gaining traction despite the U.S. chip export ban..In addition to its core e-commerce and cloud computing businesses, Alibaba also has a big opportunity with its international commerce segment (AIDC), which includes AliExpress and Turkey-based Trendyol. This segment grew revenue by 22% last quarter, and management expects it to turn profitable within the next year. Flipping AIDC into the black could be a major tailwind for earnings growth going forward.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-alibaba-084500815.html, The news pertains to risks associated with market volatility due to advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.

2025-06-13 08:07:00,Better Stock: Amazon or Alibaba?,"Both giants could become long-term winners, but owning their stocks would take a different mindset altogether.","The tech giants have plenty in common..Yet, they differ in other aspects like business model and prospects..One of them is clearly cheaper, but for good reasons..10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) are giants in the global tech landscape, both with prospects of continuing to extend their dominance into the future..Both companies share similarities, yet they are very different in many ways. But which of the two is a better stock to own in the next few years? Let's explore this further..At first glance, Amazon and Alibaba seem like companies separated by more than just geography. One dominates the U.S. and many parts of the Western world, while the other commands China's domestic market. But look a little closer, and you'll find that the two tech titans have more in common than not..Both companies built their vast empires on e-commerce, but have expanded into new sectors over time. Amazon began by selling books online, but has expanded into other categories and profitable businesses, including cloud computing, advertising, logistics, and media..Alibaba, on the other hand, began its business as a cross-border e-commerce platform, enabling overseas merchants to tap into China's vast supply chain. It was only in the later stage that it launched its flagship Taobao marketplace, followed by Tmall. Its success in e-commerce propelled the giant into new businesses, including fintech, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more..As both companies expanded into new sectors, they have gradually diversified their revenue base, making it more resilient to the changes in the external environment. Moreover, this diversified business model opens new opportunities to allocate capital to high-growth areas. For instance, both companies have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing to capitalize on the once-in-a-lifetime shift trend..While these companies have very different cultural roots, they do share similarities in values such as customer delight, innovation, and investing in emerging technologies and businesses, as well as long-term thinking. This DNA stems from the significant effect of their founders, Jeff Bezos and Jack Ma. Both left a strong legacy, even though they have stepped down from active management of their businesses..In short, both giants are well-positioned to sustain and grow their businesses, using their solid business models and long-term cultures..While Amazon and Alibaba are leaders in their respective e-commerce markets, their business models diverge significantly. Amazon operates a first-party retail business -- buying and selling inventory -- alongside its third-party marketplace. Alibaba, in contrast, is a pure platform. It connects buyers and sellers without holding inventory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-stock-amazon-alibaba-000700885.html," The risk classification for the article is: **No risk**, as both Amazon and Alibaba present long-term growth potential with considerations tailored to individual investment strategies and risk tolerance."

While revenue growth remains solid, which increased 16% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, the company is grappling with thinning margins across its core and emerging businesses, raising questions about long-term profitability.At the same time, JD faces intense competition across key segments, from traditional e-commerce rivals to newer entrants in food delivery and low-tier markets. As the company pushes aggressively into these areas, its cost pressures are mounting and returns remain uncertain. Let’s delve deeper to unpack these challenges and understand why it may be best for investors to stay away from the stock for now..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.JD reported a non-GAAP operating margin of just 3.9% in the first quarter of 2025, highlighting its continued struggle to convert strong top-line growth into sustainable profitability. While JD Retail managed a margin of 4.9%, up from 4.1% a year ago, the overall picture remains weak. JD Logistics delivered a thin margin of 0.3% and the New Businesses segment posted a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB 1.3 billion, translating to a steep negative 23.1% margin. These figures underscore the inefficiencies in JD’s broader operations outside of its core retail business.The pressure on margins is further intensified by rising expenses. Fulfillment costs jumped 17.4% year over year to RMB 19.7 billion, outpacing revenue growth and increasing their share of total revenues to 6.6%. Marketing and R&D expenses also climbed, limiting JD’s ability to scale profitably. Despite improvements in gross margin, these rising cost burdens raise serious concerns about the company's ability to achieve meaningful margin expansion across all segments..JD continues to spend aggressively on new growth avenues, but the payoff remains uncertain. In the first quarter of 2025, the company officially launched its food delivery business, onboarded more than a million merchants and ramped up investments in AI and automation. However, these initiatives are still in early stages and have yet to deliver meaningful financial contributions.The company acknowledged that many operational systems are still under development and the focus remains on scaling rather than profitability.

Undeterred by an eye-watering cost to borrow that’s hit about 150% of the stock price, there are plenty of traders willing to bet against CoreWeave, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics..“A lot of new guys think this new price level is an extraordinarily attractive short,” Dusaniwsky said. “Shorts are staying in because they believe the expected P&L more than offsets the financing costs.”.Borrow fees, which are annualized, are typically much lower for most other stocks. Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc., for example, both have borrow fees of less than 1%..CoreWeave’s heavy spending and the run up in its shares have made the company a popular target for short sellers, who borrow a stock and sell it with the aim of buying it back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.

However, that growth requires a lot of investment, which prompted CoreWeave last month to forecast capital spending of as much as $23 billion in its current fiscal year. The company is projected to lose $934 million this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg..Felix Wang, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, recommended shorting CoreWeave in April and has watched in disbelief as the stock has pushed higher. Still, Wang is sticking with his call and remains skeptical that CoreWeave will be able to obtain larger, new multi-year contracts in the coming years..“My belief is that there is no path forward on them reaching profitability in at least a few years and losses will continue to go higher and higher,” he said in an interview. “It’s hard, but I’m trying to screen out the noise and the meme volatility.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-shorts-face-150-borrow-133523404.html," The risk of the news belongs to **Financial Risk Management** due to the increased borrow costs following a substantial loss, potentially impacting debt sustainability and market dynamics for CoreWeave Inc."

I think we have expanded too big,” he said, referencing his return to active leadership in mid-2023..A notable inflection point came earlier this year when AI startup DeepSeek launched a new reasoning model that caught major players off guard. “We read the research papers and we said, ‘Holy cow, how come we have fallen behind? We were doing the same things,’” Tsai said, describing how the event prompted an accelerated internal response..As Chinese New Year approached, Alibaba engineers were directed to stay on-site and increase their development pace. “Our engineering lead decided and said, ‘Cancel your Chinese New Year holiday, everybody stay in the company, sleep in the office, we’re gonna accelerate our development,’” Tsai said.

While macro pressures and regulatory uncertainty still weigh on China’s tech landscape, Baidu’s cloud transformation signals a notable shift in the company’s core business dynamics. AI Cloud revenue jumped 42% year over year to RMB6.7 billion, now contributing 26% of Baidu Core revenue, up from 20% a year earlier. This growth is fueled by rising enterprise demand for generative AI capabilities and foundation models, delivered primarily through Qianfan, Baidu’s Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform.The company’s emphasis on full-stack AI infrastructure and continual model optimization, evidenced by the recent launches of ERNIE 4.5 Turbo and ERNIE X1 Turbo, has significantly cut inference costs while improving output quality.

Management emphasized that subscription revenues now make up the majority of enterprise cloud sales, with Gen AI-related subscription revenue growing at triple-digit rates for multiple quarters.Profitability is also on an upswing, with non-GAAP operating margins for AI Cloud reaching the mid-teens. However, Baidu continues to reinvest aggressively in AI infrastructure and emerging applications, such as autonomous driving and Gen AI search, which may cap near-term margin expansion.Overall, Baidu’s execution in cloud AI is gaining momentum, signaling that its multi-year bet on AI is not only paying off but also reshaping the company’s long-term growth narrative..As Baidu doubles down on AI Cloud, it faces formidable competition from Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY, both are aggressively expanding their cloud footprints in China’s evolving AI landscape.

Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward..We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model..AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early..We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years..A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:.2025.2026.2027.2028.2029.2030.2031.2032.2033.2034.

2025-06-10 21:00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is a Trending Stock,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Alibaba (BABA). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.","Alibaba (BABA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -8.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 9.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.8%..The consensus earnings estimate of $10.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.9%. This estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.06 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alibaba.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-alibaba-group-130005241.html, No risk.
2025-06-10 17:00:00,European Wax Center and 1-800-FLOWERS have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"EWCZ surges 63% in a month as earnings revisions soar, profits rise, and momentum signals a promising turnaround.","Chicago, IL – June 10, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares European Wax Center EWCZ as the Bull of the Day and 1-800-FLOWERS.COM FLWS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Baidu, Inc. BIDU, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY..Here is a synopsis of all five stocks..European Wax Center is a leading personal care and waxing services brand with a broad network of franchised locations across the US. While the company has struggled since going public in 2021, shedding more than 70% of its value in the years following its IPO, recent performance suggests a major turnaround is underway..After years of underperformance, EWCZ is now generating consistent profits, benefiting from improving margins and operational efficiency. More importantly, the stock has caught the attention of Wall Street, with both earnings estimates and share price momentum shifting sharply in its favor..The stock has surged 63% over the past month alone, yet still trades at a bargain valuation, suggesting that this may just be the beginning of a longer-term recovery. With analyst sentiment improving and the business fundamentals strengthening, European Wax Center appears to be a high-upside opportunity..European Wax Center has seen a sharp turnaround in sentiment, driven by a wave of upward earnings estimate revisions. Over the past month, analysts have significantly raised their projections, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current year earnings estimates have nearly doubled, up 97% in the last month, while forecasts for next year have jumped by 65%..Earnings are expected to grow at an impressive 18.4% annually over the next three to five years, suggesting strong long-term potential. Despite this growth, the stock remains remarkably inexpensive, trading at just 8.6x forward earnings. With a PEG ratio of only 0.46, the valuation leaves ample room for multiple expansion, while also helping to cushion downside risk..Operationally, EWCZ has been consistently outperforming expectations. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 187%. That trend looks set to continue, with the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) currently forecasting a 6.32% beat for the upcoming quarterly report. With both momentum and valuation on its side, European Wax Center is quickly shaping as a compelling opportunity..After a prolonged downtrend that lasted more than three years, European Wax Center appears to have finally found its footing. The stock has carved out a clear bottoming pattern and is now showing strong signs of a sustained reversal. Following a period of consolidation in the second half of May, shares broke out decisively in early June, confirming the trend change with a renewed surge in buying interest.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-wax-center-1-800-090000469.html, No risk.
2025-06-09 23:53:00,Baidu Trading at a Discount at 8.59X: Should You Buy the Stock?,"BIDU is trading at a steep discount, but will rising risks in AI monetization and chip supply cast a shadow on its near-term outlook?","Baidu, Inc. BIDU is currently trading at a discount relative to its industry and historical metrics, with its forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting below its five-year average, as shown below. It currently has a Value Score of B.This is a deep discount to the broader tech sector and even to Chinese peers. By comparison, Alibaba BABA has a forward P/E of 10.96 and Tencent TCEHY has 16. Meanwhile, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector is currently trading at 26.22X..Baidu Valuation.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.In terms of Baidu’s share price performance, its shares have gained only 1.8% so far this year. Meanwhile, its peers Alibaba and Tencent have surged 40.8% and 24.2%, respectively, during the same time frame. The Zacks Internet – Services industry has lost 6.3%, and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector has gained 1.3% year to date..Share Price Performance.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Let’s analyze BIDU’s current strengths and risks to determine if the stock warrants an investment at this stage..Baidu’s most immediate opportunity lies in the continued rapid scaling of its AI Cloud business. In the first quarter of 2025, AI Cloud revenue surged 42% from a year ago to RMB 6.7 billion, accelerating from 26% growth in fourth-quarter 2024. This segment now makes up 26% of Baidu Core revenue, up from 20% a year ago—a clear sign that AI Cloud is becoming a central growth driver. Triple-digit growth in generative AI and foundation model-related revenue within Cloud further suggests strong demand tailwinds. As China’s enterprise AI adoption deepens, Baidu’s Qianfan MaaS platform—with its broad model library, industry-leading inference cost efficiency, and support for multimodal and reasoning models—positions the company to consolidate its share in this expanding market.Another major opportunity is Baidu’s autonomous driving business. Apollo Go provided approximately 1.4 million rides in first-quarter 2025, up 75% year over year, and management confirmed that the service is now fully driverless in mainland China and entering new global markets such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Hong Kong. The fleet of more than 1,000 driverless vehicles and the unique, sub-$30,000 unit cost of the RT6 purpose-built robotaxi give Baidu an edge in scaling autonomous mobility. New partnerships, such as with CAR Inc., could further support asset-light, scalable growth. Baidu’s AI-powered search transformation also represents a significant long-term opportunity. As of April 2025, about 35% of mobile search results contained AI-generated content, up sharply from 22% in January. Management expects this penetration to keep rising in the second quarter. While monetization is in early testing, the ability to monetize long-tail queries and new formats could eventually expand Baidu’s ad revenue base beyond the limits of traditional search.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-trading-discount-8-59x-155300026.html," The risk classification for this news is categorized under **""AI/ML & Competition Risk""**."

2025-06-09 21:30:00,Brokers Suggest Investing in Alibaba (BABA): Read This Before Placing a Bet,"The average brokerage recommendation (ABR) for Alibaba (BABA) is equivalent to a Buy. The overly optimistic recommendations of Wall Street analysts make the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric questionable. So, is it worth buying the stock?","When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?.Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alibaba (BABA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage..Alibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.05, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.05 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy..Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 95.2% and 4.8% of all recommendations..Check price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential..Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations..This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision..In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures..Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-alibaba-baba-133010706.html," The risk of the news belongs to **market sentiment** and **valuation** due to the potential for irrational pricing based on optimistic analyst recommendations that may not hold up, leading to possible losses if valuations adjust."

Asked to explain, the chatbots responded: “To ensure the fairness of the college entrance examinations, this function cannot be used during the test period.”.China’s infamously rigorous “gaokao” is a rite of passage for teenagers across the nation, thought to shape the futures of millions of aspiring graduates. Students — and their parents — pull out the stops for any edge they can get, from extensive private tuition to, on occasion, attempts to cheat. To minimize disruption, examiners outlaw the use of devices during the hours-long tests..Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Qwen and ByteDance Ltd.’s Doubao still offered photo recognition as of Monday. But when asked to answer questions about a photo of a test paper, Qwen responded that the service was temporarily frozen during exam hours from June 7 to 10. Doubao said the picture uploaded was “not in compliance with rules.”.China lacks a widely adopted university application process like in the US, where students prove their qualifications through years of academic records, along with standardized tests and personal essays. For Chinese high-school seniors, the gaokao, held in June each year, is often the only way they can impress admissions officials. About 13.4 million students are taking part in this year’s exams..The test is considered the most significant in the nation, especially for those from smaller cities and lower-income families that lack resources. A misstep may require another year in high school, or completely alter a teenager’s future..The exam is also one of the most strictly controlled in China, to prevent cheating and ensure fairness.

While many stocks are trading at inflated valuations, there are still many good options out there to consider, which can deliver strong returns for your portfolio..Three AI stocks that possess a lot of upside and are among the cheapest options for growth investors to buy right now are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: BABA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in these stocks..Shares of Alphabet are down around 11% this year as investors are concerned about antitrust issues and a possible breakup of the business, or at the very least, changes to its core operations. But there's a lot to like about the business. The company is planning to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year as it works on creating next-generation technologies..Alphabet's core business also still looks solid. Investors shouldn't forget that while ChatGPT has been around for multiple years now, Alphabet's ad business still remains strong -- the popular chatbot hasn't made a big dent in the company's earnings. During the first three months of this year, Alphabet's revenue totaled $90.2 billion, which came in better than expectations and rose by 12% year over year..Earlier this year, it announced plans to acquire cybersecurity company Wiz for $32 billion. It's a great asset to add into the mix to enhance its growth prospects even further. Alphabet already has its own chatbot, Gemini, a robotaxi in Waymo, plus its amazingly popular core assets -- YouTube and Google Search. With an abundance of growth potential, Alphabet looks like a steal of a deal, trading at just 19 times its trailing earnings..If you're looking for more of a discounted AI stock to buy, then Alibaba may be to your liking. At 15 times its trailing earnings, its valuation is low and it compensates investors for the risk that comes with buying shares of this Chinese company..Alibaba recently released its latest AI model, Qwen3, which uses ""hybrid reasoning"" that can balance deep-thinking tasks alongside more standardized questions where speed is important.

However, as the sector stabilizes and AI emerges as the next growth frontier, two prominent players — Alibaba Group and Baidu — are positioning themselves for the next phase of expansion..Both companies represent different facets of China's digital economy. Alibaba built its empire on e-commerce and cloud services, while Baidu established dominance in search and is now pivoting heavily toward AI and autonomous driving. Despite their different origins, both are now racing to capitalize on generative AI opportunities, making direct comparison increasingly relevant..As investors seek exposure to China's tech recovery and AI transformation, these two stocks present compelling yet contrasting investment propositions. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Alibaba demonstrates remarkable resilience and diversification that positions it favorably for sustained growth. The company's first-quarter 2025 results showcase this strength, with total revenues reaching RMB236.4 billion, representing solid 7% year-over-year growth despite macroeconomic challenges. More importantly, the company's Cloud Intelligence Group accelerated to 18% growth, while AI-related product revenues maintained triple-digit expansion for the seventh consecutive quarter..The e-commerce giant's ecosystem approach provides multiple revenue streams and cross-selling opportunities. Customer management revenues at Taobao and Tmall grew 12% year over year, reflecting improved monetization and merchant engagement. This diversification reduces dependency on any single business line and creates natural hedges against market volatility..Alibaba's AI leadership, through its Qwen large language model ecosystem, is gaining significant traction. The recent strategic partnership with SAP, which will integrate Qwen into SAP's Generative AI Hub, demonstrates the commercial viability and enterprise adoption of Alibaba's AI technologies.

In the first quarter of 2025, it recorded 11% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by both internal demand and rising external client adoption. It contributed 16.2% of JD’s total revenues in the quarter. The business continues to invest heavily in automation across warehousing, sorting, transportation and last-mile delivery. These upgrades reflect JD Logistics’ shift toward long-term scalability. However, short-term profitability has been soft due to heavy investments in fulfilment capacity.JD Property, the infrastructure arm supporting JD Logistics, recently launched its first overseas logistics asset in Dubai’s Jebel Ali Free Zone. It is rapidly developing a modern logistics network around the world to boost global trade and support its international growth. These heavy investments, despite current profitability pressures, suggest a calculated trade-off that could position JD Logistics for stronger margins and competitive advantage in the long run..JD Logistics faces key competition from Alibaba’s BABA Cainiao and Amazon AMZN Global Logistics in the international logistics and supply chain space. Founded in 2013, Cainiao was born out of Alibaba’s e-commerce ecosystem and has developed a smart global logistics network with end-to-end capabilities on a global scale. Alibaba’s Cainiao offers warehousing, shipping and order fulfillment for global brands entering China and for Chinese companies selling overseas.Amazon Global Logistics is a door-to-door ocean shipping service that lets sellers move products from China straight to Amazon's warehouses.

However, as the sector stabilizes and AI emerges as the next growth frontier, two prominent players — Alibaba Group BABA and Baidu BIDU — are positioning themselves for the next phase of expansion.Both companies represent different facets of China's digital economy. Alibaba built its empire on e-commerce and cloud services, while Baidu established dominance in search and is now pivoting heavily toward AI and autonomous driving. Despite their different origins, both are now racing to capitalize on generative AI opportunities, making direct comparison increasingly relevant.As investors seek exposure to China's tech recovery and AI transformation, these two stocks present compelling yet contrasting investment propositions. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Alibaba demonstrates remarkable resilience and diversification that positions it favorably for sustained growth. The company's first-quarter 2025 results showcase this strength, with total revenues reaching RMB236.4 billion, representing solid 7% year-over-year growth despite macroeconomic challenges. More importantly, the company's Cloud Intelligence Group accelerated to 18% growth, while AI-related product revenues maintained triple-digit expansion for the seventh consecutive quarter.The e-commerce giant's ecosystem approach provides multiple revenue streams and cross-selling opportunities. Customer management revenues at Taobao and Tmall grew 12% year over year, reflecting improved monetization and merchant engagement. This diversification reduces dependency on any single business line and creates natural hedges against market volatility.Alibaba's AI leadership, through its Qwen large language model ecosystem, is gaining significant traction. The recent strategic partnership with SAP, which will integrate Qwen into SAP's Generative AI Hub, demonstrates the commercial viability and enterprise adoption of Alibaba's AI technologies. This partnership expands Alibaba's reach into enterprise solutions across China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.Financial strength remains a cornerstone advantage. With RMB597.1 billion in cash and equivalents, Alibaba maintains exceptional liquidity for investments and shareholder returns. The company repurchased $11.9 billion in shares during fiscal 2025, achieving a 5.1% net reduction in outstanding shares, while also approving $4.6 billion in dividends. This capital allocation strategy demonstrates management's confidence in long-term value creation and commitment to rewarding shareholders during the recovery phase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $10.62 per share, indicating a 17.87% year-over-year increase.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-vs-baidu-chinese-internet-165700911.html," **Risk Classification: Market Risk**  The analysis comparing Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) as Chinese internet stocks reflects a competitive evaluation within the tech sector.

But according to a report from The Information, the Chinese tech giant is struggling to gain traction with major domestic customers despite rising interest in homegrown solutions..Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly warned of Huawei’s growing capabilities and the broader acceleration of China’s chip development efforts due to U.S. export restrictions. Yet ByteDance,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and  Tencent Holdings Ltd  (F:NNND) ADR (OTC:TCEHY), three of China’s AI leaders, have yet to place significant orders for Huawei’s Ascend chips, even as supplies of Nvidia’s products tighten under U.S. trade controls..Multiple employees across leading firms told The Information that Huawei is ""having a hard time convincing some of the biggest tech companies in China to use its chips."" Engineers and executives at Chinese firms have voiced concerns over performance shortcomings with Huawei’s hardware, as well as fear of violating American trade laws..Tests by firms such as ByteDance and Alibaba revealed issues with overheating in Huawei’s Ascend 910C chip and limitations in its software stack, Cann, compared with Nvidia’s industry-standard Cuda platform. Transitioning from Nvidia to Huawei would also involve a high switching cost, requiring a redesign of data center infrastructure, software, and engineering workflows. If the firms are to switch over to Huawei chips en masse, executives say that the company must adapt to its platform..Some developers, like DeepSeek, may play a pivotal role in shaping Huawei’s trajectory as others watch closely to see whether an ecosystem can form around its chips. “If DeepSeek is willing to adopt Huawei’s chips and software in AI training extensively, it will attract many open-source developers to build their models on Huawei’s ecosystem. But at the moment, that isn’t the case,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Qingyuan Lin, cited by The Information..Huawei’s new AI compute system, CloudMatrix 384, attempts to compensate for individual chip performance by linking as many as 384 Ascend processors together. But the system faces technical roadblocks, including high power consumption and lack of native support for FP8, a low-precision number format essential to cutting-edge AI training..A further complication is geopolitical: a recent U.S. Department of Commerce warning puts companies using Huawei’s advanced AI chips at risk of “substantial criminal and administrative penalties.” This has already led at least one Chinese data center firm to cancel a tentative order for Huawei hardware.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-struggles-break-nvidia-ai-155908072.html," The news relates primarily to **market competition** and **economic risks**, specifically how Huawei's struggle against NVIDIA impacts its growth and stability in China."

While that’s good enough for second-best on the S&P 500 Index, it has Palantir trading at a staggering 205 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, a hefty premium to the broader market’s multiple of 22 times..“You’re starting to see almost like a Tesla effect where valuations don’t really matter because there are these true believers in the company,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs. Those investors see “opportunities with everything that’s going on in the world today, whether that be on the defense side, whether that be on the transaction side, data side or AI side.”.Shares slumped as much as 5.7% Wednesday, on track to snap the three-day streak of gains..Palantir’s cult-like momentum rally — which follows a 340% gain in 2024 and a rise of 167% in 2023 — stands in sharp contrast to a lukewarm reception from Wall Street analysts. The stock has only eight buy equivalent ratings and is dominated by 16 holds, with six sells, making it one of the lowest rated S&P 500 stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg..But bullish investors say the Street is overlooking a company poised to benefit from the current geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop. Palantir works with the US military, which has doubled its use of the Maven AI system, and intelligence agencies. It recently added NATO as a customer and is partnering with Fannie Mae to launch an AI-powered crime detection unit. It’s also building out its commercial and international clients, both large potential growth areas..Palantir’s rebound from April has been underscored by a broader market pivot as investors navigate Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff rhetoric and search for companies offering relative safety, including those that can show solid future growth. Palantir forecasts sales will rise to $3.9 billion for the calendar year 2025, a 36% increase from the previous year, and will continue to grow. This year’s free cash flow is forecast to top $1.5 billion, a more than 30% increase on the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-investors-unfazed-sky-high-113148821.html," The article discusses Palantir Technologies' stock surge despite high valuation and investor interest in its AI capabilities.

2025-06-03 08:05:00,Where Will Alibaba Stock Be in 10 Years?,The Chinese e-commerce and cloud giant faces lots of long-term challenges.,"Alibaba’s stock trades far below its record high..It faces competitive, macro, and regulatory challenges..But it could still stabilize its business and evolve over the next decade..10 stocks we like better than Alibaba Group ›.Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), the largest e-commerce and cloud company in China, went public at $68 per share on Sept. 18, 2014. It raised $25 billion, making it the largest IPO in history at the time, and it held that record until Saudi Aramco's $29.4 billion IPO in 2019..Alibaba's stock closed at a record high of $310.29 on Oct. 27, 2020. That marked a 356% gain from its IPO price. At the time, investors were dazzled by the robust growth of its e-commerce and cloud businesses, as well as its rapid expansion into adjacent markets..But today, Alibaba's stock trades at about $114. China's antitrust regulators cracked down on Alibaba's e-commerce business by forcing it to ax exclusive deals with merchants, rein in its promotions, and seek regulatory approvals for all its future investments and acquisitions. All of that pressure, along with a record $2.8 billion fine, eroded its defenses against aggressive competitors including PDD and JD.com..At the same time, China's soft economic growth forced many companies to rein in their cloud spending. Alibaba also scrapped a long-awaited IPO for its fintech affiliate Ant Financial in 2020, and it also walked back plans to spin off cloud, logistics, and Freshippo grocery units in 2023 and 2024. Investors sensed its high-growth days were over, and its stock stumbled. Those setbacks were worrisome, but can Alibaba's stock bounce back over the next 10 years?.Alibaba splits its business into seven groups. The Taobao and Tmall Group hosts its two largest online marketplaces in China, the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group handles its overseas and cross-border e-commerce marketplaces (including Lazada in Southeast Asia, Daraz in South Asia, Trendyol in Turkey, and AliExpress for its overseas customers), and the Cloud Intelligence segment houses its cloud infrastructure platform and related AI services..Alibaba's Cainiao group provides both first-party and third-party logistics services, its Local Services group provides localized delivery services within China, and its Digital Media and Entertainment Group handles streaming video, audio, and film production businesses. Lastly, the ""All Others"" segment operates the company's brick-and-mortar stores and non-core digital platforms.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-alibaba-stock-10-years-000500646.html," The risk classification for the news is as follows:  1. **Market Risk** - The long-term performance and valuation of Alibaba's stock are subject to market fluctuations and investor sentiment changes. 2. **Geopolitical Risk** - Global regulatory environments and international trade policies could impact Alibaba's operations. 3. **Technological Risk** - The company's ability to adapt to technological advancements in AI, e-commerce, and other emerging technologies is a key factor. 4. **Supply Chain Risk** - Alibaba's reliance on global supply chains for logistics and manufacturing exposes it to disruptions. 5. **Environmental Risk** - Climate change could affect Alibaba's operations, particularly in regions where the company has significant operations.  No risk was identified that does not fall into one of the above categories."
2025-06-02 20:33:00,Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) Is Increasing Its Dividend To CN¥1.98,Alibaba Group Holding Limited ( NYSE:BABA ) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 10th...,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 10th of July to CN¥1.98. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 0.9%, which is below the industry average..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, Alibaba Group Holding's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business..Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 44.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 2.4% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.. Check out our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding .The company has maintained a consistent dividend for a few years now, but we would like to see a longer track record before relying on it. Since 2023, the annual payment back then was CN¥7.1, compared to the most recent full-year payment of CN¥7.54. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 3.1% per annum over that time. It's good to see at least some dividend growth. Yet with a relatively short dividend paying history, we wouldn't want to depend on this dividend too heavily..Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Alibaba Group Holding hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years. While EPS growth is quite low, Alibaba Group Holding has the option to increase the payout ratio to return more cash to shareholders..In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The dividend has been at reasonable levels historically, but that hasn't translated into a consistent payment. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio..Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

2025-05-30 21:00:00,Is Trending Stock Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) a Buy Now?,"Zacks.com users have recently been watching Alibaba (BABA) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","Alibaba (BABA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Shares of this online retailer have returned -2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 8.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.48 per share, indicating a change of +9.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.8% over the last 30 days..The consensus earnings estimate of $10.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.9%. This estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.06 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-alibaba-group-holding-130014844.html, No risk

While that might be a setback, it doesn't negate the nice returns received over the last twelve months. In that time we've seen the stock easily surpass the market return, with a gain of 48%..Although Alibaba Group Holding has shed US$16b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns..Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time..Alibaba Group Holding was able to grow EPS by 74% in the last twelve months. This EPS growth is significantly higher than the 48% increase in the share price. So it seems like the market has cooled on Alibaba Group Holding, despite the growth. Interesting..The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)..It is of course excellent to see how Alibaba Group Holding has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Alibaba Group Holding's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further..When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Alibaba Group Holding, it has a TSR of 51% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!.We're pleased to report that Alibaba Group Holding shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 51% over one year. And that does include the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 8% per year over five years. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. Is Alibaba Group Holding cheap compared to other companies?

Details of the upgrade weren’t provided and the company didn’t respond to an email seeking further comment..The Hangzhou-based startup stunned the global tech industry in January when it unveiled the original R1, a reasoning AI model that outperformed Western players on several standardized metrics, purportedly at a cost of just several million dollars. It triggered a reconsideration of heavy investments in acquiring AI computational resources and a flurry of new model introductions from Chinese players from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Zhipu AI..“The fast pace of model releases and updates since the release of DeepSeek R1 has resulted in some ‘model fatigue’ among investors,” said Gary Tan, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “Until there is a breakthrough in the model, investors are turning their focus on which internet companies can integrate AI into their operations and create a killer application.”.The debut of R1 turned DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng into a tech celebrity and a symbol of China’s ability to compete with the best of Silicon Valley. In February, President Xi Jinping invited Liang to a high-profile gathering with some of the country’s most prominent entrepreneurs. The young founder was seated among the likes of Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma..DeepSeek’s upgrade was announced hours before the latest financial report from Nvidia Corp., the leading maker of AI chips whose shares were pummeled in the immediate wake of R1’s release.

Find out which stock stands tall.,"Baidu BIDU and Alibaba BABA are two of China’s tech titans that have increasingly pivoted toward artificial intelligence (AI). Both companies dominate their respective fields – Baidu in online search and AI cloud services, Alibaba in e-commerce and cloud computing – yet they share notable similarities. Each is profitable, generates substantial cash, and has been pouring investments into cutting-edge AI research and applications.In fact, Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Baidu have recently captured renewed investor attention thanks to a series of positive developments (including massive government stimulus and the rise of AI services) after a few challenging years. With China’s AI sector booming, these two companies stand out as key players riding the trend.Let's dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Baidu, often dubbed “China’s Google,” has successfully repositioned itself as an AI-first company, marking a significant shift toward cloud computing and AI services in recent years. The company’s aggressive push into AI has yielded promising results, particularly in its first-quarter 2025 performance. Baidu Core’s revenue growth was driven largely by its AI Cloud business, which surged 42% year over year. AI Cloud now represents 26% of Baidu Core’s revenue, up from 20% in the same period the previous year, highlighting increasing recognition of Baidu's AI capabilities.A key driver behind Baidu’s AI growth is its model-as-a-service platform, Qianfan, which offers an extensive model library and supports fine-tuning of multimodal and reasoning models. By reducing inference costs, Qianfan has made Baidu’s cloud offerings especially attractive to enterprise clients, bolstering subscription-based revenue. (read more: Baidu's Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Margins Down Y/Y).Baidu further strengthened its AI leadership with the launch of ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1, and their Turbo versions in April 2025. These models promise superior performance at lower costs, enabled by Baidu’s unique four-layer AI architecture that optimizes infrastructure, frameworks, models, and applications. As part of its strategy to drive accessibility, Baidu plans to open-source ERNIE 4.5 by June 30, 2025, helping expand its ecosystem.Despite challenges such as U.S. chip export restrictions, Baidu remains confident in its ability to maintain momentum, citing efficient GPU utilization and growing domestic chip capabilities. Additionally, Baidu’s mobile search product is increasingly AI-driven, with 35% of mobile search results now featuring AI-generated content, up from 22% in January.In terms of challenges, the company posted a negative free cash flow of RMB 8.9 billion in the first quarter, largely due to elevated AI investments despite a strong operating margin of 16% for Baidu Core and a non-GAAP margin of 19%. Management signaled further increases in capital outlays for AI Cloud, model development, autonomous driving, and AI search transformation in 2025.The ongoing weakness in online advertising is a concern. Even in the latest quarter, Baidu’s core online marketing revenues declined 6% year over year, extending the prior year’s decline. Competition from rivals (e.g., ByteDance’s TikTok/Douyin in advertising, Tencent in digital ads, etc.) and the shift of ad budgets to new platforms have made it harder for Baidu to grow its search ad business. In cloud computing and AI, Baidu faces competition from Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Holdings Limited’s TCEHY cloud services.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-vs-alibaba-chinese-ai-164500676.html," The article discusses the investment comparison between Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA), specifically examining their respective strengths in autonomous driving and AI-powered cloud services. The associated risks include:  1. **Competitive Risk**: Potential market competition affecting both stocks, as investors may reassess their holdings based on performance. 2. **Regulatory Risk**: Possible legal or financial repercussions from AI-related issues impacting investor confidence. 3. **Industry-Specific Risk**: Concerns about the stability and future of AI technology in China and its global applications. 4. **Market-Moving Event**: The news could influence broader tech market trends, affecting both companies' valuations.

While Alibaba has expanded into cloud, AI, and international markets, JD.com continues to build on its strength in supply chain and core retail. Both companies are also tapping into new growth areas like food delivery and instant commerce to stay ahead in a competitive landscape.With China's economy gradually stabilizing and digital consumption rebounding, investors are watching closely to see which platform offers stronger, more sustainable growth. Let’s break down their latest earnings and strategies to find out which stock has the greater upside potential..Alibaba has been benefiting from its continued pivot toward AI, international e-commerce and retail. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $32.81 billion in revenues, up 6.96% year over year. The Taobao and Tmall Group has been steadily improving monetization through the rollout of a 0.6% software fee and BABA’s AI-powered digital marketing tool Quanzhantui, which has helped drive a 12% rise in customer management revenues.The company’s loyalty base has also expanded, with 88VIP members surpassing 50 million, supporting higher user retention. 88VIP is Alibaba’s premium paid membership program through which members can enjoy exclusive benefits across the company’s ecosystem.Alibaba’s international commerce segment has been growing rapidly, up 22% year over year in the last reported quarter, as the company continues to localize supply chains and refine models like AliExpress Choice, which have been improving unit economics and narrowing losses.The company has also been seeing strong results from its investments in AI developments. Alibaba Cloud revenues rose 18%, with AI product revenues continuing triple-digit year-over-year growth for the seventh straight quarter. Its open-sourced Qwen3 AI model family, launched in April, had been downloaded more than 300 million times by April end, driving adoption across multiple industries.BABA has been expanding its instant commerce push with a RMB 10 billion investment into Taobao Shango and Ele.me, which has already shown promising early results in user engagement and efficiency.Overall, Alibaba has been streamlining its focus by exiting non-core assets like Sun Art and Intime, and redirecting capital into scalable segments..JD.com has been benefiting from its focus on supply chain strength, price competitiveness and retail expansion into lower-tier markets. In the first quarter of 2025, JD reported $41.79 billion in revenues, up 16.01% year over year, supported by continued growth in core retail. Electronics and home appliances rose 17%, and general merchandise grew 15%, with supermarket and fashion categories maintaining double-digit growth for five consecutive quarters.User engagement has been rising steadily. JD has been enhancing shopping frequency and ARPU through AI-powered recommendations, better after-sales services, and personalized delivery features. The company reported more than 20% year-over-year growth in active customers in the last reported quarter.JD’s 3P marketplace has been expanding with more merchants and SKUs, especially in value-driven markets. This has been driving 16% year-over-year growth in marketing and marketplace revenues, with the low-price strategy resonating across lower-tier cities.JD has also been aggressively expanding into food delivery, nearing 20 million daily orders. It has been onboarding merchants at zero commission, offering full rider insurance, and leveraging its retail infrastructure for scale. These efforts have been helping build cross-platform user engagement.JD Logistics has been contributing with 11% revenue growth, driven by continued automation in warehousing and last-mile delivery. The company’s gross profit rose 20%, and non-GAAP net income surged 43% year over year to RMB 12.8 billion, highlighting strong margin discipline.JD has also been investing in AI ad automation, expanding Jingxi in rural areas and and enhancing user operations to drive long-term growth through improved platform efficiency and stronger user engagement.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-vs-jd-com-chinese-133200596.html," The news relates to the comparison of two Chinese e-commerce companies, Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com, focusing on their growth drivers and profit potential.

The company’s latest quarterly report, released earlier this month, highlights strong year-over-year performance and signals meaningful progress in China’s advancement in artificial intelligence and cloud computing..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.From a long-term investment perspective, I believe Alibaba remains undervalued. Multiple avenues for potential upside exist, including stable performance in e-commerce, AI-powered cloud services, enhanced shareholder returns, and China’s evolving global positioning within the broader geopolitical landscape. While the latter remains speculative and subject to change, it is essential to consider it in the company’s long-term growth trajectory. Overall, I maintain a tentatively bullish outlook on BABA..Alibaba’s March quarter report posted a promising turnaround. Revenue rose 7% year-over-year, driven by stronger consumer spending and market share gains in key business lines. Notably, operating income on a comparable basis grew 93% year-over-year due to a rising top line and better cost control..The firm reduced operating costs and share-based compensation and boosted the efficiency of its platforms. That drove adjusted EBITA 36% higher than the previous year—a definite indication that underlying profitability is gaining traction. Net income reached $1.65 billion, rising 1,203% year-over-year, albeit partly fueled by one-off investment gains. Even excluding those, non-GAAP net income grew 22%..Cash generation was also strong, with operating cash flow up 18% year-over-year. In short, Alibaba is not only growing again—it’s turning that growth into cash and profit. That’s an instructive signal for investors seeking to ride out sustainable momentum if geopolitical headwinds don’t persist..Alibaba’s Cloud Computing segment is emerging as a significant growth driver, fueled in large part by the company’s strategic focus on artificial intelligence. In the fourth quarter, revenue from the Cloud Intelligence Group rose 18% year-over-year, reaching approximately $4.15 billion..Of particular note is the consistency of Alibaba’s AI-related revenue. The company has achieved an impressive milestone of seven consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth from AI-powered cloud products. CEO Eddie Wu has identified the growing demand for generative AI as a major catalyst for this momentum. This trend is also reflected in the segment’s profitability, with adjusted EBITA increasing by 69% year-over-year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geopolitical-jitters-push-alibaba-baba-170000936.html, No risk
2025-05-24 21:15:00,3 Signs That Alibaba's Turnaround Effort Is Bearing Fruit,Alibaba is working toward regaining its glory.,"E-commerce revenue growth accelerated in recent quarters..Artificial intelligence-related revenue grew by triple digits..Investors enjoyed $16.5 billion in buybacks and dividends..10 stocks we like better than Alibaba Group ›.Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) has been on a journey of transformation over the past two years as it prepares for the next growth phase. In this process, the Chinese e-commerce giant almost completely reshuffled its senior leadership team (including its CEO), doubled down on core businesses, and paid more attention to delivering shareholder value..While its turnaround work is ongoing, there are early indicators that this effort has begun to deliver positive outcomes. Let's dive in and take a closer look..Once the undisputed leader in the Chinese e-commerce industry, Alibaba seems to have lost its way in the last few years as younger peers like Pinduoduo and Douyin gradually expanded their market share at the expense of the incumbent..But since Eddie Wu took over as Alibaba's CEO, he has brought new focus to the company by doubling down on core aspects of the business -- customer delight and artificial intelligence (AI) -- while axing unrelated companies, such as offline supermarkets. For instance, early this year, the tech conglomerate disposed of its shares in Sun Art, a brick-and-mortar supermarket, to focus on its core e-commerce platform business..So far, these efforts have already brought positive results to the business. For example, the Chinese e-commerce business reported 12% growth in customer management revenue in the quarter ended March 31, an acceleration from the 9% growth reported in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024. Comparatively, the customer management revenue growth rate was just 4% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. It is also worth mentioning that 88VIP, the highest-spending customer group, grew by double digits year over year to more than 50 million..Beyond its Chinese e-commerce business, Alibaba's international e-commerce business grew 22% for the latest reported quarter. This business is highly diversified in regions (Europe, Asia, and the Gulf Region) and platforms (Aliexpress, Trendyol, etc.), providing enormous growth opportunities in the coming years..Once dubbed the rising star within Alibaba Group, Alibaba Cloud experienced a difficult period in fiscal 2024, when revenue grew at just 3% amid weak demand and competition. It didn't help that Alibaba Cloud cancelled its planned initial public offering, further impacting investor sentiment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-signs-alibabas-turnaround-effort-131500269.html, No risk

That sparked concern among some experts that it would likely fall behind in the race to the newest technology frontier..💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸.Despite these concerns, Apple continued moving forward, seemingly confident in its underwhelming AI strategy. It rolled out its Apple Intelligence platform to iPhone, iPad, and iMac users in October 2024..Now, the company is gearing up to finally advance its AI efforts, something many Apple enthusiasts likely will cheer. But a challenge from Capitol Hill might be about to get in the way at a highly pivotal time..Since its founding in 1976, Apple has focused on approaching technology differently than its competitors, a methodology championed by founder Steve Jobs. Given this part of its history, it makes sense that the company would take a different approach to AI than both its old and new rivals..Related: Analyst projects $3,500 iPhone price after Trump sends message to Tim Cook.While Apple Intelligence has been mostly successful, despite some problems with tools such as news summarization, the company has recently focused on enhancing its AI features. This included making a deal with Chinese tech leader Alibaba  (BABA)  to add AI-powered features to the iPhones it sells in China..This plan seems to be in danger, though, as Apple’s decision draws backlash from Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle. At a time when tensions between Washington and Beijing are rising steadily, politicians are heavily scrutinizing Apple’s deal with Alibaba on the grounds that it could help the Chinese company enhance its AI capabilities..Reports indicate that members of the Trump administration, as well as House Select Committee on China, have asked Apple leaders about the deal directly. Their questions centered around the data that Apple would have to share with Alibaba and whether the Chinese company would be making commitments to its country's regulators..Current White House officials aren’t the only ones expressing strong concern regarding Apple’s potential deal with Alibaba. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), the ranking member of his party on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has referred to Alibaba as a “poster child for the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-users-hate-latest-news-193700819.html, The risk category identified for the news article is **Reputational Risk**.

Analysts predict further cuts this year, with some forecasting another 40-basis-point reduction by December..The rate moves lifted broader markets too: Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 1.5% and mainland Chinese benchmarks also advanced..With China targeting 5% GDP growth in 2025, these small but symbolic rate cuts may signal Beijing's willingness to deploy more monetary tools to shore up growth..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-baidu-shares-climb-beijing-192245209.html," The news indicates that Chinese tech stocks have risen following a decrease in the prime rate, suggesting positive investor sentiment and optimism.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street’s radar..US President Donald Trump is all set to revive the country’s struggling coal industry. Last month, he signed a series of executive orders so that the government could meet the surging energy demand of AI data centers.

This will be done to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence..READ NOW: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street Right Now and 9 AI Stocks Poised to Gain from Trump’s Middle East AI Push.Repeatedly promoting coal as a power source for data centers, Trump told the World Economic Forum in January that he would be approving power plants for AI through an emergency declaration. He also called on tech companies to use coal as a backup power source..“They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup — good, clean coal.”.However, with the tech industry investing billions of dollars to expand renewable energy and leveraging nuclear power as a way to meet its growing electricity demand, the use of coal is actually against the tech companies’ environmental goals..Nevertheless, the tech industry does acknowledge that fossil fuel generation will eventually be needed to help navigate the electricity demand from AI. However, these companies are focusing on natural gas as it emits less half the CO2 of coal per kilowatt hour of power..“To have the energy we need for the grid, it’s going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time. We’re not surprised by the fact that we’re going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term.”.We would certainly consider it but I don’t know if I’d say it’s at the top of our list.”.-Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark.For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

2025-05-19 21:00:00,Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","Alibaba (BABA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +13.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +13.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 18.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.95 points to a change of +21.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.46 indicates a change of +13.7% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Alibaba.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-130013957.html, No risk.

2025-05-19 18:23:00,Alibaba Group Holding's (NYSE:BABA) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's,Alibaba Group Holding Limited's ( NYSE:BABA ) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period...,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (NYSE:BABA) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to CN¥1.98 on 10th of July. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 0.9%..This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality..The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, Alibaba Group Holding was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business..Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 45.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 2.4% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.. See our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding .Looking back, the dividend has been stable, but the company hasn't been paying a dividend for very long so we can't be confident that the dividend will remain stable through all economic environments. Since 2023, the dividend has gone from CN¥7.1 total annually to CN¥7.57. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.3% over that duration. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income..The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately, Alibaba Group Holding's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year. While growth may be thin on the ground, Alibaba Group Holding could always pay out a higher proportion of earnings to increase shareholder returns..In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The payout ratio looks good, but unfortunately the company's dividend track record isn't stellar. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious..Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

The stock is still up about 45% on the year, as of this writing..That said, the results clearly showed that the turnaround at the company's e-commerce business is progressing, while it continued to demonstrate strong artificial intelligence (AI) growth within its cloud-computing segment..Let's take a closer look at Alibaba's most recent earnings to see if investors should buy the dip..Alibaba's largest and most important business by far remains e-commerce, which consists of its leading Tmall and Taobao platforms. Tmall is similar to Amazon's marketplace business and is where established brands sell their merchandise. Taobao is more akin to eBay, but without the auction format, where anyone can sell their goods..In the past few years, the company's e-commerce business has been under pressure from a weak Chinese economy and heavy competition led by PDD's popular Pinduoduo platform. However, the company has been investing in its e-commerce business to make it more competitive, and its efforts began to show up this fiscal year, first through gross merchandise value (GMV) growth and then later with revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) growth..This continued in fiscal 2025's Q4 (ended March 31, 2025), with the e-commerce segment growing its revenue 9% year over year to $14 billion, including 12% growth in its important third-party business. Alibaba credited the growth to a higher take rate from an earlier new software service fee it implemented and increasing uptake of its new AI marketing tool, Quanzhantui..Importantly, its segment EBITA climbed 8% to $5.8 billion. This shows its e-commerce business is not just growing but growing profitably. It said it continues to see strong new customer growth along with continuous increases in orders. Its 88VIP premium memberships continued to grow by double digits, topping 50 million members..Alibaba plans to invest heavily in ""instant commerce"" whereby customers can get items purchased on its Taobao platform delivered within an hour.

The surge was driven primarily by public cloud adoption and the rapid expansion of AI use cases. Importantly, Alibaba saw broad-based demand not just from internet-native sectors like autonomous driving and online education, but also from more traditional industries such as manufacturing and animal farming, which are now migrating workloads to the cloud in order to deploy AI tools..The momentum is translating into real profitability. Adjusted EBITA for the Cloud segment rose 69% year-over-year, boosted by a shift toward high-margin services and greater operating efficiency. Alibaba is clearly doubling down on this trend. In April, it launched the Qwen3 model family, featuring both dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures, optimized for enterprise use cases..With over 300 million downloads and more than 100,000 derivative models globally, Qwen has become the world’s largest open-source model ecosystem. Combined with enterprise adoption of GPU leasing and tools like PolarDB (now used by ICBC), Alibaba’s cloud-AI flywheel looks primed to spin faster from here..On the e-commerce front, Alibaba continued proving its strength in domestic and international markets. Taobao and Tmall, its core commerce platforms, posted 12% year-over-year growth in customer management revenue (CMR), a key indicator of monetization and advertiser demand.

This improvement was supported by the introduction of software service fees and the growing adoption of Quanzhantui, Alibaba’s comprehensive marketing solution, which helped boost monetization efficiency across the platform.The number of 88VIP members, BABA’s highest-spending consumer group, continued to increase year over year in the double digits to 50 million in the quarter.

The rise was attributed to customer management revenues, which grew 12% year over year to RMB 71.08 billion ($9.9 billion), driven by the year-over-year improvement in take rate, partially offset by the decrease in direct sales revenues as a result of the company’s planned reduction of certain direct sales businesses.China Commerce Wholesale (5.7% of Taobao and Tmall revenues): The business generated revenues of RMB 5.8 billion ($798 million), which grew 17% on a year-over-year basis.

Let's look at Michael Burry, the investor who bet against the housing market in 2008. He was made famous by the film The Big Short. He is now betting against Nvidia. Burry purchased put options which profit from put price declines on the chipmaker. He also bought puts on China stocks like Alibaba, Baidu, jd.com, and then liquidated the majority of his portfolio. Not required in the disclosure is the why behind the moves, so we don't know why he's selling Nvidia, but when it comes to China stocks, he was previously a buyer and has slowly been unwinding his positions as those stocks have outperformed in the first quarter, perhaps a little profit trimming there. His firm Scion only has one remaining equity stake, and it's in Estee Lauder, the shares up about 7/10 of a percent at the moment, but we saw a huge pop off the back of that news from Michael Burry's firm there. .Well, speaking of Nvidia. .Speaking of Nvidia, the company reportedly increasing its stake in CoreWeave. The AI infrastructure stock surging on the news. You can see here those shares up nearly 19%. Of course, Nvidia already having a stake in the company previously. Let's talk a little bit more about this. Nvidia reporting the stake in the cloud computing provider to over 24 million shares. Again, that's 7% of outstanding shares. This disclosure was made in a 13G filing where companies have to report their holdings to the SEC. Nvidia was expected to have a little over a 5% stake in the company after CoreWeave's IPO. This was shown in a prospectus that was out on March 31st. Nvidia did anchor CoreWeave's IPO back towards the end of March with an order of about $250 million worth of shares. That was roughly 17% of the deal. And that is according to reporting from the company Bloomberg News. But you've got a huge pop in the stock off the back of this news of Nvidia again increasing its stake in CoreWeave. Those shares are up 19%. They had a strong earnings result this quarter in terms of revenue. There were questions about the company's debt load, which did put a little bit more pressure on the stock, but that's certainly being ignored in a focus instead on Nvidia reporting an increased stake in CoreWeave here.

The company's stock was down 7.9% as of 12:43 p.m. ET and fell as much as 8.3% earlier in the day. The steep decline comes as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) edged up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was up 0.1%..The Chinese tech giant reported quarterly earnings that fell significantly short of Wall Street's expectations..Alibaba reported weaker-than-expected results for the quarter ended March 31. Its net income of $1.71 million (12.38 billion Chinese yuan) was well below analysts' expected $2.93 billion. Revenue grew 7% year over year to $32.58 billion, also falling short..The 7% revenue growth rate is less than previous quarters, pointing to a deceleration and highlighting issues in Alibaba's core e-commerce business. The Chinese economy isn't recovering the way many investors had hoped, and consumer spending has not returned to levels analysts had forecast..Alibaba also faces increased competition from JD.com and Temu domestically, while AliExpress, Alibaba's international marketplace, is reeling from the U.S.-China trade tensions. AliExpress also faces competition from Temu and Shein, as well, of course, from Amazon..While Alibaba faces significant challenges in the near term, the company is making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and building for the future. Still, with a rocky domestic economy and international trade wars, the company's stock could struggle for some time. However, long term, I think Alibaba will succeed, and with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) a little over half of that of Amazon, its stock is attractively priced..Before you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.

Catch Yahoo Finance's full interview with Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong as the cryptocurrency exchange prepares to join the S&P 500 (^GSPC) starting May 19..Catalysts host Madison Mills and guest host, Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz, take a quick look at these stocks trending on the Yahoo Finance platform..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here..Time now for some of today's trending tickers. This morning we're watching Alibaba, eToro and Coinbase. First up, Baba missing estimates for physical fourth quarter with revenue growing a disappointing 7% from a year earlier. Analysts were hoping the Chinese e-commerce giant bet on AI would provide a bigger boost. The shares down about seven and a half percent. And this is really an indicator of the Chinese consumer and the health of that consumer as well. Obviously not holding up given the fall here and the miss on fourth quarter revenue. But Tim, I want to bring you in. How do you think about a name like Baba amid the uncertainty on the Chinese economy and American Chinese relationship? .Well, Maddie, I mean obviously this was disappointing growth today. But I think you do need to step back and and look at the different business units retail. There's a lot of competition, might be challenging. But I think what what makes us excited on the stock is this is literally the the the potential to own the AI infrastructure market in China. The the long term growth potential is a story you want access to. And we sit here looking at the stock trading 13 times earnings. That's probably undervalued for the growth potential that we see there. So yes, it's not what we wanted to see in the short term. They've disappointed several of the last few quarters, but long term, I think you have to take a step back and look at the the major tailwinds that the stock has. .So you think of it more as an AI play than a Chinese economy impacted name? .I think the e-commerce side is going to be a little tougher. There's a lot more competition on that side. But yes, you know, China is looking to scale up AI just like the US is if not faster. So you want to be in a name like that, a lot of tailwinds from that side of the business. .All right. Well, let's move to another stock. We are watching here eToro pulling back after its strong Nasdaq debut. The stock and crypto trading app raised nearly $310 million in its initial public offering on Tuesday. The shares down a little over six and a half percent at the moment. And Tim, I had an analyst tell me this is the next Robin Hood yesterday, which is up over 50% year to date. Is this a normal pullback on day two, or is this something more sinister? .Well, I think if you look at the rally yesterday, it gave us a lot of confidence that the IPO market is very strong. Everybody was excited about it coming into this year. Tariffs kind of killed that. This was not the first time they tried to go public. They were very selective about when they did it. And I you know, look at the rally in the context of the last two days. You know, we think that that's still very strong. And again, they're aligning with some of these longer term trends, more trading crypto, you know, a lot to like about the stock. But I think it's more about what it tells us about the health of the IPO market. .Certainly, yeah, that has been under a lot of pressure. So it'll be interesting to see if we start to get a little bit more on that. And but finally here, let's look at Coinbase saying hackers bribed its workers outside the US to steal customer data, then demanded a $20 million ransom. The company saying it has not paid the demand and is cooperating here with law enforcement. The crypto exchange also saying it could cost up to $400 million to fix the problem. The shares down a little over five and a half near five and a half percent. And initially, off the back of this news, we didn't see too much of a share reaction, obviously the huge run up in coin, also because it was just added to the S&P 500. How are you thinking about the risks? I mean, this is a classic crypto risk that is unfolding here. .Yeah, you have to understand the risks as as an investor. And I think this is just growth pains, right? It's an industry that's developing. You're starting to see, you know, these other risk creep in, how do you mitigate them? But again, I would say you look at the long term trend, more and more investors, whether it be institutional or retail like we talked about earlier, want access to the space. This is a good way. Coinbase is a leader here. And when you look at security, they're leading the charge as well. So short term blip here, it's going to happen as the industry grows and evolves. But I don't think it changes the long term growth narrative of the stock. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/alibaba-revenue-miss-etoro-ipo-143543072.html," The news presents several risk categories:  1. **Alibaba (BABA)**: The revenue miss may impact investor confidence in future performance, affecting stock price stability.  2. **eToro (ETOR)**: The pullback after IPO trading suggests uncertainty about the company's growth and profitability, potentially leading to market volatility.  3. **Coinbase Global (COIN)**: A data breach involving bribed non-US employees raises significant concerns about security, legal risks, and reputational damage. Additionally, joining the S&P 500 could lead to increased scrutiny regarding this incident.  All three events contribute to financial, operational, and regulatory risks that could impact market stability and investor sentiment."

Adjusted EBITDA rose 36% to RMB32.6 billion, also a modest miss. Results were weighed down by weakness in logistics arm Cainiao and continued investment in international and local services..A bright spot was Alibaba’s Cloud Intelligence Group, which delivered 18% year-over-year revenue growth to RMB30.1 billion. UBS noted triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue, which more than offset concerns about margin softness. “Stronger external demand post DeepSeek’s launch further reinforces cloud as a long-term driver,” analyst Kenneth Fong wrote, highlighting increased adoption of AI infrastructure services..Morgan Stanley’s Gary Yu echoed that view, calling cloud performance a key highlight of the quarter. “Cloud met our expectations and remains one of the most important parts of the Alibaba investment story, particularly as enterprise digitalization and AI adoption gain pace across China,” he said. Yu also noted that EBITA margins in cloud were impacted by timing mismatches between capex investments and revenue generation... an expected tradeoff given the segment’s current growth phase..Fong maintained a Buy rating and $180 price target, citing stable core commerce trends and narrowing losses in non-core segments. “Taobao Tmall beat on customer management revenue by 3%, aided by improved take rates and promotional tools,” he wrote. Morgan Stanley also reiterated an Overweight rating and identical price target, with Yu emphasizing that total adjusted EBITDA came in 6% above their expectations..Alibaba’s shares fell 7.5% in Thursday’s trading following the report, reflecting investor sensitivity to headline revenue and EPS misses. Still, analysts pointed to positives, including ongoing share repurchases, a higher full-year dividend of $2 per ADS, and continued free cash flow generation, signaling that both firms see meaningful upside from current levels..Related articles.Analysts see long-term upside in Alibaba despite earnings miss.JetBlue downgraded as risk/reward now more balanced: Raymond James.CoreWeave gets additional $4B commitment from OpenAI, boosting deal to nearly $16B",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-see-long-term-upside-142845984.html," The news pertains to the financial performance of Alibaba Group Holdings, specifically its quarterly results leading to a stock price decline despite analysts maintaining a positive outlook.

2025-05-14 22:01:00,BABA vs. PDD: Which Chinese E-Commerce Giant is a Stronger Pick?,"Alibaba's AI-driven revival and cloud momentum make it the standout Chinese e-commerce play for 2025, offering better value and growth potential than rival PDD Holdings.","In the ever-evolving landscape of Chinese e-commerce, two titans stand out: Alibaba Group BABA and PDD Holdings PDD. These tech behemoths have transformed China's digital economy while expanding their global footprints. Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, pioneered China's e-commerce revolution with its Taobao and Tmall platforms, later diversifying into cloud computing, digital media, and logistics. PDD Holdings, parent company of Pinduoduo, emerged as a formidable competitor with its social commerce model that disrupted traditional online shopping.Both companies are navigating similar challenges in the current environment: adapting to China's regulatory landscape, expanding international operations, and leveraging AI to drive growth. With China's economy showing signs of stabilization and e-commerce spending recovering, investors are increasingly looking toward these sector leaders for opportunities. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now..Alibaba is demonstrating renewed momentum in its core e-commerce business, with customer management revenues at Taobao and Tmall Group growing 9% year over year in the most recent quarter. This rebound comes after implementing a ""user-first, AI-driven"" strategy that has successfully reaccelerated growth across its platform ecosystem. The company is now focusing on high-quality development with greater emphasis on enhancing user experience and merchant efficiency rather than just pursuing volume growth.Alibaba's cloud business represents a significant growth catalyst, with revenues increasing 13% year over year in the December quarter. The company is making an unprecedented RMB 380 billion ($53 billion) investment in cloud and AI infrastructure over the next three years, more than its total spending in this area over the past decade. This positions BABA to capitalize on the rapidly expanding AI market, with its AI-related product revenues already achieving triple-digit growth for six consecutive quarters.The company's international expansion shows promise, particularly through AliExpress and Lazada, which continue to gain traction globally. Management's strategic divestments of non-core assets like Sun Art and Intime (totaling approximately $2.6 billion) demonstrate a disciplined approach to capital allocation, allowing greater focus on core growth areas. With a massive cash position of $51.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2024, Alibaba maintains substantial financial flexibility to fund growth initiatives while continuing share repurchases.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $137.03 billion, indicating 5.01% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.4% over the past 60 days to $8.92 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baba-vs-pdd-chinese-e-140100377.html, No risk.
2025-05-14 22:00:00,4 Reasons to Buy Alibaba Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,The Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader could head a lot higher.,"Alibaba's core e-commerce and cloud businesses are stabilizing..Its artificial intelligence ecosystem is rapidly expanding..A trade deal between the U.S. and China could send its stock soaring..10 stocks we like better than Alibaba Group ›.Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA), the largest e-commerce and cloud company in China, might seem like a risky stock to buy amid the rising tariffs and intensifying trade wars. However, its stock has actually risen nearly 50% since the beginning of the year as it impressed investors with the stabilization of its e-commerce business and the growth of its cloud and AI platforms..But even after that rally, Alibaba's stock remains nearly 60% below its all-time high from October 2020. Let's review four reasons Alibaba could head higher -- and why it's still worth buying..Alibaba suffered a major slowdown in fiscal 2022 and 2023 (which ended in March 2023). Its e-commerce business struggled with new antitrust restrictions, intense competition from aggressive competitors like PDD Holdings, and China's sluggish economic growth. Its cloud business also faced tougher macro and competitive headwinds..Metric.FY 2021.FY 2022.FY 2023.FY 2024.9M FY 2025.Revenue growth.41%.19%.2%.8%.6%.Adjusted net income growth.30%.(21%).4%.11%.(4%).Data source: Alibaba. FY=fiscal year..But over the past two years, Alibaba's top line growth stabilized. It offset the slower growth of its Taobao and Tmall marketplaces in China by expanding its overseas marketplaces -- Lazada in Southeast Asia, Trendyol in Turkey, and AliExpress for its cross-border sales -- and its Cainiao logistics business. Its cloud business is also growing again as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expands..As China's largest cloud infrastructure services provider, Alibaba has plenty of bricks to build its own AI ecosystem. That's why it launched Qwen, its new family of large language models (LLMs), to support the market's new generative AI applications two years ago..Alibaba launched its latest version, Qwen3, in late April. In most benchmarks, it's comparable to American-developed LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.5/o4-mini, Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, Alphabet's Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Meta Platforms' Llama 3. Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, Qwen is a fully open-source platform. Qwen can also run its small to medium LLMs across a broad range of Nvidia's GPUs, including its midrange PC chips, which aren't subject to the U.S. export curbs against China.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-buy-alibaba-stock-140000423.html," The news about Alibaba stock falls under **market risk** and fundamental risk.  1. **Market Risk**:     - Volatility due to general market conditions or economic factors affecting tech stocks, such as changes in consumer behavior, increased competition, or broader economic downturns.  2. **Fundamental Risk**:    - Concerns include potential regulatory challenges, operational risks (like supply chain issues), slower than expected growth, increased competition from domestic or international players, and shifts in government policies towards technology companies.  While the article presents a positive outlook without immediate negative information, these factors could impact Alibaba's stock price. Therefore, while there is no explicit risk mentioned, the potential for underlying issues exists."

Approaching the weekend, expectations for common ground between the two rival nations were underwhelming – to say the least. China and the US had each imposed triple-digit tariffs on each other, so high that most investors on Wall Street essentially thought of them as a trade embargo..Meanwhile, representatives from the United States, like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, said that the negotiation between the United States and China could take three years and that “everything is on the table,” including the potential to de-list US-traded Chinese ADRs such as e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com..However, on Monday, stocks exploded to the upside, with the Nasdaq gaining more than 4% and the S&P 500 gaining ~3%, recouping all the losses (and then some) since President Trump’s April 2nd “Liberation Day.” Why are investors so happy? Both US and Chinese officials communicated the idea that more progress was made than initially anticipated and that the sides will finalize a pact as soon as possible..Most importantly, each side is slashing tariffs on each other for the next 90 days. The US will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145%, and the Chinese will lower tariffs to 10% from 125%. The cooling of trade relations will provide Wall Street with something it hasn’t had in the past month: certainty. Finally, the US and China released an extremely rare joint statement..President Donald Trump’s busy weekend did not stop with trade negotiations. Trump shared on his social media platform “Truth Social” that the United States will be instituting a “Most Favored Nation’s Policy” via executive order whereby the United States will pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price worldwide. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF and big pharma giants like Merck were lower in early trading Monday..Chat-GPT-parent OpenAI made plans over the weekend to renegotiate its partnership with Microsoft to shift to a public benefit corporation to eventually IPO. OpenAI, which has been under the “non-proifit” umbrella since its founding, has been moving toward a for-profit structure for months, and this news formalizes it.

JD Takeaway said it would invest the sum over a year, while Ele.me did not disclose the timeframe..""The competition is so intense, there's not a lot of incremental growth opportunities, so everybody is moving into everybody else's territories and instant retail is the latest example of that,"" said Jason Yu, general manager at CTR Market Research..China's food delivery market leader Meituan has moved to grow its business by expanding its instashopping platform, which delivers non-food goods within 30 minutes and JD.com announced its entry into food delivery in February..""In the past people would go to JD.com to buy a mobile phone and they would deliver to you in the same day, then suddenly they could go to Meituan and have the new Apple iPhone delivered within 30 minutes. That posed a direct threat to JD.com and they moved into food delivery in response,"" Yu said..At the end of April, Alibaba expanded its instant shopping portal on its domestic e-commerce app Taobao. That gave users access to restaurants, coffee shops and bubble tea chains available on Alibaba's Ele.me - China's second-largest food delivery player behind Meituan - plus many other categories including pet food and apparel..Alibaba, JD.com and Meituan did not respond to requests for comment..Subsidised spending on instant retail from Alibaba and JD.com is being welcomed by cost-conscious consumers..Users on JD Takeaway currently enjoy discounts of up to 20 yuan, or $2.77, per day for deliveries from restaurants including McDonald's, Haidilao and Burger King.

Institutions own 45% of Alibaba Group Holding.Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit..A look at the shareholders of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 48% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company..Meanwhile, institutions make up 45% of the company’s shareholders. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies..Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Alibaba Group Holding, beginning with the chart below.. Check out our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding .Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index..As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Alibaba Group Holding. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Alibaba Group Holding, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too..Alibaba Group Holding is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 5.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.8% by the third-largest shareholder..A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority..While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.

President Donald Trump's administration on May 2 ended the de minimis policy allowing packages worth less than $800 ordered online from China and Hong Kong to enter the U.S. duty-free.","By Helen Reid.LONDON (Reuters) - An agreement between the United States and China to temporarily slash tariffs stopped short of reinstating the U.S. ""de minimis"" duty exemption for ecommerce packages from China, but still gives online retailers like Shein and Temu a window to adapt their businesses..The Chinese firms, which have taken market share from dollar stores and mall rivals to surge to among the top ten downloaded apps in the U.S., will likely use the 90-day reprieve to bring in bulk shipments and restock their U.S. warehouses, trade experts said..President Donald Trump's administration on May 2 ended the de minimis policy allowing packages worth less than $800 ordered online from China and Hong Kong to enter the U.S. duty-free..Shipping products duty-free from Chinese factories to American consumers helped Temu and Shein surge in popularity, selling ultra-cheap gadgets, clothes, and accessories to American shoppers. Their success drove Amazon.com to set up a copycat service, Amazon Haul, which also benefited from the de minimis policy..The removal of de minimis exposed those packages to steep tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese goods, threatening business models centered around rock-bottom prices and leading Shein and Temu to cut advertising spending in the U.S. and turn to Europe instead. Amazon Haul launched last week in the UK and Saudi Arabia..With the de minimis issue absent from Monday's announcement, trade experts said the exemption did not seem to be coming back. Even so, the 90-day cut in tariffs to 30% from 145% would help Shein and Temu restock their U.S. warehouses at lower cost..""This is great for Shein and Temu, if nothing else, to replenish their U.S. inventory,"" said Yao Jin, associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University of Ohio..Instead of making individual shipments by plane, Shein and Temu are likely to ship products in bulk via container ship to the U.S. over the next 90 days to stock up ahead of the next possible tariff increase, said Jin..Temu owner PDD Holdings, Shein, and Amazon did not immediately reply to requests for comment..On its U.S. website, Temu has been featuring products already in U.S. warehouses as it shifts its business model away from direct factory-to-consumer shipments. On May 2 Temu said all sales in the U.S. were now handled by locally based sellers..About 50% of air cargo shipments on the China to U.S. route were low-value e-commerce prior to the de minimis exemption removal, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at pricing platform Xeneta.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ecommerce-packages-left-u-china-112717370.html," The risk classification for the given news is:  1. **Trade Uncertainty**: Volatile US-China relations could lead to further tariffs affecting global e-commerce companies.  2. **Reliance on Temporary Measures**: The 90-day reprieve might not prevent overbuying, leading to potential profitability issues or inventory obsolescence.  3. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Even with reduced tariffs, shipping challenges could delay restocking efforts and cause stockouts.  4. **Currency Fluctuation Risks**: Volatility in the US dollar/yen exchange rate may increase restocking costs for Chinese retailers.  5. **Competitive Landscape**: Limited resources compared to established international brands might hinder growth and competition.  6. **Strategic Misalignment**: Future trade policies could target other product categories, creating long-term uncertainties.  These risks suggest that while the reprieve offers a short-term advantage, it may not address underlying challenges affecting Shein and Temu's sustainability."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other Michael Burry stocks with huge upside potential..Michael Burry, founder and manager of Scion Asset Management, is best known for predicting and profiting from the housing bubble’s collapse in the mid-2000s. His bold contrarian bet was famously chronicled in the book and film “The Big Short.” Burry’s investment strategy draws heavily from the rigorous market analysis and principles outlined in Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book “Security Analysis.” The book championed the merits of financial statement analysis, highlighting the importance of intrinsic value and structured investment principles..That said, Burry has never shied away from putting his own distinct stamp on Wall Street’s time-tested principles. By utilizing complex financial tools, such as derivative securities and short-selling, Burry has amassed a fortune, challenging conventional market wisdom. His 2001 Scion Value Fund letter provides a fascinating insight into his contrarian outlook, which prioritizes long-term value over short-term price fluctuations. Burry makes it clear that to achieve significant long-term returns, he is willing to tolerate short-term volatility. He stated:.“I will always choose the dollar bill carrying a wildly fluctuating discount rather than the dollar bill selling for a quite stable premium.”.He also has no qualms about making significant investments in a few stocks that he believes are undervalued, a tactic the investor employed to strengthen Scion’s holdings at the end of 2024..In the quarter that ended on December 31, 2024 just before DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence breakthrough sparked a $1.3 trillion surge in Chinese tech stocks, Michael Burry offloaded some of his investments in the country’s tech stocks. The moves came amid a period of high volatility for Chinese stocks, when investors appeared to be losing faith in Beijing following the implementation of a stimulus package in late September. The government’s actions triggered a wild rally until early October, though momentum waned due to a property crisis, a poor economic outlook, and dissatisfaction with the scope of fiscal stimulus in the following months..For this article, we examined Scion Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to list down Michael Burry’s stock picks with the highest upside potential. We ranked the companies in ascending order of their upside potential. These equities are also popular among elite hedge funds.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-baba-among-210749461.html," **Risk Classification:**  The news regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) involves a comparison with other ""Michael Burry Stocks"" based on contrarian analysis.

I predict three stocks will be worth more than Palantir five years from now..Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ: ISRG) market cap is roughly $70 billion smaller than Palantir's right now. But I suspect the tables could be turned in the not-too-distant future..Granted, Palantir is growing more rapidly. However, Intuitive Surgical continues to deliver impressive growth, too. The robotic systems pioneer's revenue jumped 19% year over year in the first quarter of 2025. Procedure volume for Intuitive's da Vinci robotic systems should increase by 15% to 17% this year..Importantly, Intuitive Surgical looks like a bargain compared to Palantir. Sure, Intuitive's shares trade at a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 68. That seems almost cheap, though, when stacked up against Palantir's nosebleed forward earnings multiple of 196..What I like most about Intuitive Surgical is the high probability of strong future growth. Around 2.7 million procedures were performed using da Vinci last year. Intuitive estimates roughly 8 million procedures are done annually for which it already has products and clearances. The company is targeting approximately 22 million soft-tissue procedures with products and clearances under development..Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) is already somewhat larger than Palantir. Based on the two companies' recent revenue growth, though, some might think this dynamic could change relatively soon. I predict, though, that Alibaba will widen its market cap gap over Palantir over the next five years..Valuation plays a big factor in my projection. We've already seen how mind-blowingly high Palantir's forward earnings multiple is. Meanwhile, Alibaba's shares trade at only 12.5 times forward earnings. The company's growth prospects make its valuation look even more attractive: Alibaba's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on analysts' five-year earnings projections is a low 0.71.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-stocks-worth-more-094500515.html," The article discusses three stocks expected to outperform Palantir Technologies over the next five years due to various factors: Intuitive Surgical's growth potential, Alibaba's AI-driven expansion, and Alphabet's size advantage. However, broader market risks such as economic downturns, regulatory changes, technological shifts, and competitive pressures could impact these predictions. Additionally, each company faces its own set of challenges that might affect their performance. Therefore, the news carries a risk due to the inherent uncertainty in future events.  Answer: The news carries a moderate risk due to potential market volatility, unforeseen challenges, competition, and regulatory factors affecting the predictions for stock performance."
2025-05-10 17:25:00,Apple (AAPL) Scrambles to Regain Chinese Market Share as Trade War Intensifies,"Global tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL), long dominant in the smartphone and personal computing markets, is now grappling with significant headwinds in China that will likely weigh on growth in the near term. As anticipated, the company is beginning to address these issues, driven by the absence of a foldable smartphone offering and underwhelming AI capabilities. While Apple has not officially confirmed a foldable device, Bloomberg reports suggest it is close to rolling out its Apple Intelligence AI","Global tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL), long dominant in the smartphone and personal computing markets, is now grappling with significant headwinds in China that will likely weigh on growth in the near term. As anticipated, the company is beginning to address these issues, driven by the absence of a foldable smartphone offering and underwhelming AI capabilities..Discover companies with rock-solid fundamentals in  TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter..Receive undervalued stocks, resilient to market uncertainty,  delivered straight to your inbox..While Apple has not officially confirmed a foldable device, Bloomberg reports suggest it is close to rolling out its Apple Intelligence AI suite in China, following delays since last October. Though this marks progress, I remain neutral on the stock, as I believe the current valuation fairly reflects the company’s fundamentals, offering limited upside and little margin of safety..My concerns regarding Apple’s continued growth stem from its poor recent performance in China, one of the company’s most important target markets, hauling in 17% of revenue in the previous financial year. Most recently, Apple’s China revenue fell 8% YoY, and in Q2 FY2025, China revenue declined over 2%, suggesting that struggles are continuing in the new financial year as well. A closer study of Apple’s performance in China reveals that the failure to launch a foldable smartphone in China has cost the company market share..According to Canalys data, Apple’s China smartphone shipments were 42.9 million in 2024, a notable 17% YoY decline. As a result, the company’s market share fell to 15%, behind Vivo and Huawei. Interestingly, both Vivo and Huawei reported strong shipment growth in 2024 (11% and 37%, respectively), which reveals Apple’s struggles are isolated..Interestingly, while total smartphone shipments in China grew just 4% in 2024, foldable smartphone shipments grew 27% YoY, confirming the tailwinds supporting this niche market segment. With a market share of almost 50% in the foldable smartphone segment, Huawei led the way in 2024 (four of the five best-selling foldable smartphones in 2024 were Huawei models)..Although there are rumors of a foldable iPhone, Apple has yet to confirm them. As long as the company fails to cater to the surging demand for foldable smartphones in China, Apple is unlikely to reverse market share losses in the foreseeable future..Another factor that has kept me cautious on Apple recently is the lackluster progress the company has made with AI. In China, the lack of AI features has led to dissatisfied customers. A survey conducted by Canalys found that Chinese consumers had the strongest AI inclination among the top three smartphone markets in the world (China, the U.S., and India). Data revealed that 43% of Chinese consumers have a high AI inclination, compared to just 15% in the U.S. Although Apple’s AI deficit may not harm U.S. sales, applying the same playbook to China has already proven to be costly.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-scrambles-regain-chinese-092508266.html, **Risk Classification:** Competitive Risk

But these giants and many much smaller companies could have their existence as U.S.-traded companies threatened by a revived trade war against Beijing launched by U.S. President Donald Trump..Last week, several Republican members of Congress, including Representative John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, wrote recently appointed Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins to “express grave concern over the continued presence of Chinese companies on U.S. stock exchanges.”.In a letter reported by the Financial Times, the lawmakers pointed to U.S.-listed Chinese companies, large and small, from giants like Alibaba and JD.com to smaller startups like EV brand Xpeng and self-driving car provider Pony.AI..Worries over delisting have grown since late February, when Trump revived the threat of kicking Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges in his “America First Investment Plan.” In his memo, Trump ordered officials to determine whether Chinese companies were upholding U.S. auditing standards and investigate the structures these firms use to list on foreign exchanges..Since then, administration officials have declined to rule out taking action against U.S.-listed Chinese companies, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noting in a mid-April TV interview that “everything is on the table.”.“The threat is growing in a significant way,” says Sandeep Rao, a researcher at Leverage Shares..The NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies listed in the U.S., is down by around 7% since “Liberation Day.” By comparison, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks tech companies traded in the Chinese city (including some that also trade in the U.S.) is down by 4.6% over the same period..Chinese companies have long turned to the U.S.’s deep and liquid markets to raise capital. Alibaba’s IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 raised $25 billion, the world’s largest IPO at the time, and only superseded by Saudi Aramco’s 2019 listing in Riyadh..As of the end of March, 286 Chinese companies are listed on U.S. exchanges, with a total market value of $1.1 trillion, according to exchange data cited by the South China Morning Post.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threat-kick-china-u-exchanges-030000100.html, The risk associated with the news belongs to the category of **Geopolitical Risk**.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other billionaire Lei Zhang’s stock picks with huge upside potential..Lei Zhang, the founder and CEO of Hillhouse Capital, is one of the most influential yet low-profile figures in the world of investing. Born and raised in China, Zhang later studied in the US, earning an MBA from Yale, where he was influenced by David Swensen, the university’s legendary endowment manager. It was with Swensen’s support that Zhang launched Hillhouse in 2005, initially backed with capital from Yale’s endowment fund. Hillhouse Capital started small but quickly established itself as a powerhouse in Asia’s fast-evolving markets. The firm is known for its long-term, research-driven approach, often taking significant positions in high-growth companies and partnering with management teams to help scale operations. Rather than chasing short-term gains, Zhang’s strategy is focused on building durable, competitive businesses..One of Hillhouse’s early and most notable investments was in Tencent, the Chinese tech giant. The firm got in when the company was still relatively unknown outside China, and the bet paid off tremendously. Other major holdings have included JD, Baidu, and Meituan, as well as a growing number of companies in sectors like healthcare, logistics, and consumer goods. Zhang’s investment style blends elements of private equity and public market investing. He’s not afraid to hold stakes for many years, and Hillhouse often works closely with portfolio companies to improve operations and governance. This hands-on, collaborative model has helped the firm build a strong reputation among entrepreneurs and institutional investors alike..Hillhouse Capital has since expanded beyond China and now manages tens of billions of dollars across Asia and other markets, with offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, and New York. Despite its size, the firm remains relatively discreet. Zhang himself rarely gives interviews and avoids the spotlight, preferring to let the results speak for themselves. Hillhouse Investment has built a reputation for exceptional returns, achieving annualized gains as high as 52% from its founding through 2012. Its expansion has been fueled by a consistent ability to deliver strong results even as the firm has grown. Hillhouse has a broad sector focus that includes technology and enterprise software. The firm also frequently collaborates with other major investors, such as Sequoia Capital, through co-investment partnerships.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-114940753.html," The news does not explicitly identify any specific risks related to Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA).

2025-05-09 00:03:00,Baidu Stock Trades 25% Below 52-Week High: Should You Buy the Dip?,"Trading below highs, surging in AI: Is Baidu quietly turning the corner?","Baidu, Inc. BIDU shares have gained 7.8% in the past month, above the Zacks Internet – Services industry’s 3.4% increase and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s rise of 4.5%. Despite this uptick, BIDU remains about 25.4% below its 52-week high of $116.25 (versus a low of $74.71). In fact, the stock is up by only 3% year to date (YTD) against the industry’s 11.8% decline.Additionally, as the threat of delisting Chinese stocks from U.S. markets is escalating, does Baidu now present an attractive entry point, or are there further challenges ahead? Could this be a good opportunity to invest in this AI stock now?.BIDU Share Price Performance.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Baidu shares are trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.. .Image Source: Zacks Investment Research..Let’s analyze the company’s prospects..Chinese tech giant Baidu has filed a patent proposing an AI-powered system to translate animal vocalizations, particularly those of pets like cats, into human language. The technology would analyze data such as sounds, behaviors, and physiological signals to identify an animal’s emotional state, then map those emotions to semantic meanings. While still in the research phase, Baidu envisions this system as a way to enhance emotional understanding and communication between animals and humans. The move aligns with Baidu’s broader push into AI, following its development of the Ernie 4.5 Turbo model..In April 2025, Baidu unveiled its latest AI model, ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, at the Baidu Create 2025 developer conference, marking a significant advancement in its artificial intelligence capabilities. ERNIE 4.5 Turbo processes and generates content across various formats, including text, images, audio, and video, enhancing its versatility in applications such as content creation and customer service. Baidu has significantly reduced the pricing for ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, offering it at 20% of ERNIE 4.5's cost and approximately 0.2% of GPT-4.5's rates, making advanced AI more accessible to developers and businesses. Alongside ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, Baidu introduced ERNIE X1 Turbo, a reasoning model designed to excel in tasks requiring deep thinking and logical analysis. It boasts enhanced capabilities in question answering, literary creation, and logical reasoning, outperforming comparable models like DeepSeek's R1 while being offered at half the cost.Baidu’s leadership in AI – from ERNIE Bot (one of China’s leading generative AI platforms) to autonomous driving – could pay off handsomely as these technologies commercialize. The company is already monetizing AI cloud services at a rapid clip, and wider AI adoption in China’s enterprises and government could drive a new growth cycle. Furthermore, Baidu’s core search business, although mature, remains a cash cow with a dominant market share in China. If China’s economy accelerates or advertising spend bounces back, Baidu could see a resurgence in its high-margin ad revenue.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-stock-trades-25-below-160300860.html," The news regarding Baidu's stock performance involves a significant drop from its 52-week high, which may indicate underlying issues affecting the company's health. The question of whether to buy the dip suggests investors are uncertain about future prospects, potentially leading to further declines if fundamentals worsen or if broader market conditions turn unfavorable.  **Risk Classification: Medium**  The risk category is Medium due to concerns over Baidu's declining stock value and potential impacts on its financial health without positive developments in AI or other areas."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater’s stock picks with huge upside potential..Up until February 18, 2025, the stock market seemed poised to replicate the 2020-2022 bull run. Save for slight corrections in April and August of 2024, the market was in a general upside trend. And investors expected the trend to intensify, thanks to the Trump effect. But before President Trump’s re-election, some voices, including that of Ray Dalio, pointed out the potential risks of this presidency to the market..Ray Dalio established Bridgewater Associates in 1975. But as of 2025, the billionaire investor isn’t part of the hedge fund’s key management. He currently acts as co-chief investment officer (CIO) mentor and member of the Bridgewater Board. Dalio also runs his family office, the Dalio Family Office, which manages over $15 billion in assets. He also does philanthropy work and he hasn’t stepped away from sharing his economic and investment insights through books, interviews, and social media..Bridgewater has grown to become the largest and most renowned investment firm in the world. Over the past 10 years, the fund has returned 39.40%, and 17.30% over the past 12 months. However, just like Dalio predicted, the Trump administration’s policies could jeopardize Bridgewater’s ability to reward investors..Since taking office for the second term, Trump has made tariffs a key part of his government’s economic policy. He issued an executive order on his first day in office and threatened 25% tariffs on all goods from China, Canada, and Mexico. The tariffs escalated through Liberation Day in April. All this time, the S&P 500 was taking one hit after another. For instance, the broad market index pulled back 12% between April 2 and April 8, 2025.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2025..Individual investors, often called retail investors, on platforms as Robinhood represent an increasingly influential market segment that exhibits active trading behaviors, responsiveness to trends and momentum, and collective market-moving power. Notable examples include the 2021 short squeezes in stocks that caused billions of losses to several hedge funds. In these instances, collective buying activity on Robinhood, coordinated through social media platforms, caused rapid and sharp stock price movements that could not be anticipated by professionals. The key takeaway is that even the least informed segment of investors can occasionally have the power to move the markets and drive pockets of volatility, which automatically creates opportunities for gains..History shows that retail interest in buying stocks sparked at or immediately before market peaks, making it an indicator of potential market overvaluation and a predictor of market corrections. However, retail investors are leveraging social media, AI, and learning tools to get more informed than ever, which has led to their behavior changing over time. For instance, it was widely reported that retail investors have injected billions of dollars into US stocks during the recent stock market correction. JP Morgan mentioned that during the early April meltdown, retail investors bought a record $4.7 billion worth of stocks, the highest level in over a decade. Small-cap technology was one of the favorite sector picks of individual investors amid the meltdown, while institutional investors have increased their bets against the sector. This highlights the idea that retail investors have adopted a smarter investing strategy, which involves buying dips and undervalued stocks..READ ALSO: 12 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy Under $20.The big question is how one could exploit the signals communicated by the retail trading activity on platforms such as Robinhood? The answer is by investing in the same stocks that are bought by both retail and institutional investors. Buying pressure from both these market segments will inevitably lead to upward momentum in stock prices. In other words, if everyone is buying, then odds are the stock prices will move higher. Besides that, before buying, one should make sure that the economy is moving in the right direction. We believe the outlook on the US economy is becoming more optimistic than it was last month, for the following reasons:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-170130377.html, Market Sentiment
