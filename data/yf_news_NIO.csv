2025-06-26 21:04:00,Will NIO's Q2 Sales Volume Rebound Stabilize Its Cash Flow?,NIO targets a Q2 sales rebound to 72K-75K units as it eyes a return to positive free cash flow in 2025.,"NIO Inc.’s NIO cash outflow from operating activities rose to RMB 7.8 billion in 2024, up from RMB 1.38 billion reported in 2023. It experienced a further decline in its cash position in the first quarter of 2025, partly due to seasonal fluctuations in vehicle sales. Sales dropped to 42,000 units in the first quarter from 72,000 units in the fourth quarter of the previous year. This decline resulted in a working capital outflow of more than RMB 10 billion. The company also incurred capital expenditures and one-off expenses during the quarter.However, the company has been actively raising funds. In late March, it completed a fundraising round on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and raised approximately HKD 4.03 billion. Since the transaction was finalized in early April, the proceeds were not reflected in the first-quarter financial results. Starting in April, the company has observed a recovery in sales volume, which is expected to help normalize operating cash flow.For the second quarter, the company has provided sales volume guidance of 72,000 to 75,000 units, suggesting year-over-year growth of 25.5% to 30.7%, which should further support improvements in operating cash flow. Higher sales targets have also been set for the third and fourth quarters, which are expected to drive continued growth in cash flow. Overall, the company anticipates achieving positive free cash flow for full-year 2025..Li Auto LI reported net cash used in operating activities of RMB 1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an improvement from the RMB 3.3 billion outflow in the same period a year ago. However, Li Auto reported a reversal from the RMB 8.7 billion cash inflow recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. Li Auto’s free cash flow stood at negative RMB 2.5 billion, which narrowed from a negative RMB 5.1 billion in the year-ago quarter but was down from a positive RMB 6.1 billion in the previous quarter.Tesla, Inc. TSLA posted net cash provided by operating activities of $2.16 billion in the first quarter of 2025, up from $242 million in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Tesla reported positive free cash flow of $664 million versus negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024..NIO has underperformed the Zacks Automotive-Domestic industry year to date.

2025-06-23 21:45:00,1 Massive Problem Facing Nio Investors. Is the Stock Still a Buy?,China's EV production capacity utilization is near an alarming 50% level.  The price war in China has hit all competitors -- foreign and domestic.  Nio's focus will be on accelerating deliveries through Onvo and Firefly.,"China's EV production capacity utilization is near an alarming 50% level..The price war in China has hit all competitors -- foreign and domestic..Nio's focus will be on accelerating deliveries through Onvo and Firefly..10 stocks we like better than Nio ›.It almost seems impossible to think China's automotive market was once the most desirable in the world. At a time when China's automotive market sales were exploding, foreign automakers were quick to enter the market and make a buck while the young and inexperienced Chinese automakers watched and learned..Fast forward to today, and the story has nearly flipped. While auto sales are still lucrative in volume, the country is embattled in a brutal price war that has eroded profits. And for competitors like Nio (NYSE: NIO), a little more bad news is on the way..If you're invested in global automakers, you've likely heard a thing or two about the situation in China. Market leader BYD continued to apply pressure in late May when it announced an aggressive pricing strategy that slashed prices as much as 34% on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June..China's price war, which has become so devastating that it's forced government officials to call executives together in an attempt to soften the impacts and avoid a race to the bottom, is likely far from over. The price war might actually be distracting investors from a deeper issue for the automotive industry, and that's overcapacity..According to data from Shanghai-based Gasgoo Automotive Research Institute, China's overall industry capacity utilization was a meager 49.5% -- leaving a massive chunk of the country's 55.5 million annual vehicle production capacity unused..Then came the words that analysts have warned about and investors have feared: The price war may have no end. ""As long as you have 50 percent capacity realization, you won't be able to end the price war in a normal market,"" said Jochen Siebert, managing director at auto consultancy JSC Automotive, according to Automotive News..For Nio and its investors, much of its problem in China is currently out of its control. At some point many automakers in China will be forced out of business or to consolidate, leaving a much healthier industry. Until that time comes, Nio's primary focus will be on cost improvement to offset margin pressure from the price war..The good news is we've seen some tangible progress from Nio on cost cutting. In fact, during the first quarter of 2025, vehicle margin increased to 10.25% from the prior year's 9.2%. Gross profit also made a substantial 88.5% increase to $126.7 million, compared to the prior year. The price war still hurts and Nio's net loss widened during the first quarter, but more optimization is on the way.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-massive-problem-facing-nio-134500093.html
2025-06-23 21:00:00,Investors Heavily Search NIO Inc. (NIO): Here is What You Need to Know,"Zacks.com users have recently been watching NIO (NIO) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","NIO Inc. (NIO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -10.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, which NIO falls in, has lost 7.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..For the current quarter, NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of +11.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +36.2% over the last 30 days..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.04 points to a change of +31.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +13.4%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.42 indicates a change of +58.9% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.1%..With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NIO.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-nio-inc-130005380.html
2025-06-22 16:55:00,3 No-Brainer EV Stocks to Buy Right Now,The global business isn't in quite the trouble it seems to be in the United States. Just be sure to look a bit off the beaten path.,"China’s EV powerhouse, Nio, is in the right place(s) at the right time with the right vehicles at the right price points..Navitas Semiconductor provides power-efficient solutions that the EV industry didn’t even know it would eventually need..The EV business’s success or failure is ultimately rooted in the lithium batteries all EVs need. QuantumScape stands ready to deliver next-gen battery solutions..10 stocks we like better than Nio ›.There's no denying that President Donald Trump isn't as supportive of electric vehicles (EVs) as his recent predecessors were. Then again, U.S. consumers' interest in EVs hasn't exactly remained robust either. Domestic sales of electric vehicles fell 4.4% in April, according to S&P Global Mobility, ending a 14-month growth streak. Separately, AAA (which you know as the travel and road service company ""Triple A"") reports that the likelihood of an American purchasing an EV has now fallen (for a third consecutive year) to only 16% of the country's car owners..Be careful of jumping to sweeping long-term conclusions based on short-term data, however, or information that only applies within the United States. The EV business is a global one and isn't going away. It's going to continue evolving until electric vehicles become an irresistible choice..With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three EV stocks anyone anywhere in the world can get excited about buying..American drivers have never seen an electric vehicle manufactured by Nio (NYSE: NIO) on U.S. roads. That doesn't mean they aren't out there, though. The Chinese company delivered 221,970 cars last year alone. It just delivered most of them within China, with a handful being sold in select parts of Europe. It's looking to establish sales channels in the Middle East soon as well..These are all markets that are not only more supportive of the alternative but also where consumers are increasingly interested. The International Energy Agency expects 80% of China's vehicle sales to be all-electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030, for instance, with Europe not far behind at 57% of its automobile market by then. Globally, that translates into an average annualized growth pace of 11%, led by the Asia-Pacific market through 2034, according to an outlook from Precedence Research. Nio's wide selection of practical sedans, SUVs, and wagons at a range of affordable prices positions it to win at least its fair share of this growth..Nio isn't yet profitable, to be clear. It's making consistent progress to that end, though, and will likely ease out of the red and into the black within the next few years. While that's far from being ideal for interested investors, just bear in mind that Tesla shares also made tremendous gains well before the company was consistently profitable. Sometimes, progress is enough.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-ev-stocks-085500283.html
2025-06-20 07:24:00,NIO Stock Presents a Mixed Outlook as Strong Growth is Offset by Persistent Losses,"Chinese EV-maker NIO (NIO) continues to test the patience of its shareholders. In Q1, as reported on June 6, the company missed both top and bottom-line estimates by a wide margin, and once again disappointed when it came to losses.

On the bright side, deliveries and sales have been growing at a solid pace, with its affordable Onvo-branded models showing promising momentum.

While I partly agree with that sentiment, I think going long on NIO only makes sense once we see clear signs that the losses are stabilizing and that a path to a sustainable bottom line is in sight. Until then, I believe NIO is a Hold..While NIO has made some solid progress in terms of vehicle deliveries and volume, the Chinese EV makers’ financial performance tells a different story. In Q1 2025, NIO delivered 42,100 vehicles—a 40% increase compared to the same period last year. The issue is that this jump in deliveries didn’t translate into a similar increase in revenue, not even half. Vehicle sales revenue grew by just 18.6%, mainly due to the growing contribution of its more affordable models (its Onvo brand), which aligns with NIO’s strategy to capture broader market segments..However, the primary concern remains that the company still falls short in terms of overall profitability. Operating losses increased to $884 million, up from $740 million, a year earlier—even though total revenue rose to $1.66 billion. Looking at vehicle margins, there was a year-over-year increase to 10.2%, but a drop from 13.1% in the previous quarter, which reflects growing pricing pressure in China’s EV market..All of this continues to intensify pressure on NIO’s liquidity, making the need to raise fresh capital more urgent, likely through further shareholder dilution. In fact, back in March, NIO raised around HKD 4.03 billion (~US$510 million) through a share issuance in Hong Kong..To clarify, since NIO is a foreign company listed on the NYSE via American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), it follows International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting standards. That means it doesn’t publish full quarterly cash flow statements—only annual ones.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-stock-presents-mixed-outlook-232400550.html

NIO reported a gross margin of 7.6% in the first quarter of 2025, up from 4.9% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by increased sales of high-margin segments, such as parts, accessories, after-sales services and technical R&D services, alongside higher vehicle margins and reduced losses in Power Solutions due to a growing user base. Vehicle margin rose to 10.2% compared with 9.2% in the year-ago period due to lower material costs per unit.Starting in June, NIO began rolling out new models with improved profitability. While NIO ES6 is expected to deliver a vehicle margin of around 20%, the EC6 and ET5 series are projected to achieve even higher vehicle gross margins. As a result, NIO anticipates the vehicle margin for the second quarter to reach approximately 15%, helping the company achieve a double-digit overall gross margin.The company expects accelerated growth in the third quarter, driven by robust deliveries, lower supply chain costs and improved bill of materials efficiency from new products and technologies. These developments should continue to enhance both vehicle and overall gross margins.In the fourth quarter, NIO plans to launch the next-generation ES8, a highly competitive model. The company projects monthly deliveries of around 25,000 units, suggesting a 20% year-over-year increase from 2024.

Some of the problems that the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has faced include:.Elon Musk Reputation: Earlier this year, Tesla faced boycotts and vandalism from the left after CEO Elon Musk became embroiled in political backlash due to his political work under the ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) cut government programs like US AID. More recently, Musk faced backlash from the right after getting into a social media spat with President Trump over the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" (Musk and Trump have since made amends)..Sales Slump: Tesla sales have fallen across key markets like Europe and China over the past few years while profit margins have declined. Meanwhile, tariff uncertainty has disrupted the Tesla supply chain, threatening to impact gross margins further negatively..Intense Competition: Tesla faces competition from subsidized Chinese competitors like Li Auto, Nio and BYD, among others..Despite the many challenges Elon Musk and Tesla have had to overcome, the TSLA shares are up about 75% over the past twelve months, trouncing the S&P 500's 9.3% gains..The reason for the robust performance is that investors are beginning to discount Tesla's long-awaited and delayed Tesla Robotaxi. But are investors suffering from ""hopium,"" or are they justified in doing so?.Earlier this month, the first driverless Tesla Model Y Robotaxi was spotted in Austin, Texas, the home of CEO Elon Musk. Officially, Musk and the team plan to conduct a limited launch ""tentatively"" on June 22. Alphabet's Waymo Robotaxi service has the first-mover advantage over Tesla. Waymo has already launched its geofenced service across several US cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin..With Waymo conducting approximately a quarter million paid Robotaxi rides per week, it's easy for investors to get lulled into the notion that Waymo will dominate the Robotaxi market.

But with weak margins & fierce EV price wars, is it worth buying now?","NIO Inc. NIO is a notable name in the Chinese EV market with several growth drivers in place. Vehicle deliveries are rising, new models are being rolled out, its battery swap technology gives it an edge, and the company continues to make progress in smart driving and operational efficiency..Despite these, NIO shares have been down 20% so far in 2025 and are currently trading below the $5 mark. That’s around 94% off its all-time high levels. So, should you scoop up the shares now on the hopes of a potential rebound? Or are there still enough challenges that outweigh the positives? Let’s break down..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.In the first quarter of 2025, NIO delivered 42,094 vehicles, up 40.1% year over year. For the second quarter, it expects 72,000-75,000 deliveries, signaling growth both on a year-over-year and sequential basis..New model launches are fueling momentum. In late May, NIO rolled out ES6, EC6, ET5, and ET5T. Its next-generation ES8 SUV is slated for launch in the fourth quarter of this year..The company is also banking on its sub-brands to expand market share. ONVO, which targets the mainstream market, and Firefly, which is focused on smaller premium EVs, are starting to gain traction. Since April, ONVO has made several operational and organizational adjustments that have boosted productivity and improved the sales team’s efficiency. Orders for ONVO vehicles have been rising steadily since late April..ONVO’s first model, the L60, is off to a solid start. The second model, the L90, is set to begin deliveries in the third quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, Firefly’s first model began deliveries in late April..However, competition is intense. NIO’s closest peers, Li Auto LI and XPeng Inc. XPEV, continue to outpace it in deliveries. In the last reported quarter, XPeng delivered 94,008 vehicles, while Li Auto sold 92,864. NIO still has quite a bit of catching up to do..NIO is making strides in smart driving technology with its NIO World Model (NWM), a core part of its NADArch 2.0 architecture. NWM allows real-time decision-making directly from raw sensor data. Since late May, NWM has been rolled out to vehicles on the Banyan platform. NIO’s in-house smart driving chip, the NX9031, is now used in the flagship ET9, as well as ES6, EC6, ET5, and ET5T, and will power more upcoming models.

Rumors are swirling that CATL could purchase some of Nio's battery-swapping unit.  Nio (NYSE: NIO) has always been a fascinating stock to follow with its many ups and downs.,"Nio offers battery swaps at thousands of locations across China..CATL is working with automakers to standardize battery-swap technology..Rumors are swirling that CATL could purchase some of Nio's battery-swapping unit..10 stocks we like better than Nio ›.Nio (NYSE: NIO) has always been a fascinating stock to follow with its many ups and downs. The Chinese automaker is poised for strong growth on the back of launching two entirely new brands, Onvo and Firefly..Nio is also intriguing for its decision to push battery-swap technology, which it offers at thousands of locations. The idea is foreign to many U.S. investors, but it's far more popular in China. Nio recently received some good news regarding its battery-swap ambitions -- here's what you need to know..A battery swap is simply when someone with an appropriate vehicle drives a depleted battery into a swap station, and replaces it with a fully charged battery. Nio's newest vehicles can do this in roughly two-and-a-half minutes..Now, let's get to the good news. Another Chinese battery maker, CATL, is working with a group of Chinese automakers on a battery swapping technology that takes just over 90 seconds. According to Car News China, 1,000 electric vehicle (EV) sedans with CATL's ""Choco-SEB"" swappable battery have been delivered to a taxi company -- a near-perfect application for battery swaps that would limit downtime for taxi drivers..Wait a second, isn't more battery-swap competition a bad thing for Nio? Absolutely not. Nio's competition isn't truly other battery-swapping tech -- its competition is fast-charging stations. Nio needs to create an ecosystem of vehicles that use its setup to have a thriving userbase for its swapping stations, and CATL can help with this aim..CATL is working to bring together a group of automakers to develop a standardized system for battery swaps that could vastly increase the number of swapping vehicles on the road. Furthermore, rumors are floating around that CATL is looking to purchase a controlling stake in Nio Power's battery swapping unit, which, depending on the potential agreement, could vastly increase the scale of battery-swapping technology. CATL is already working on building out a network of its stations..It's also likely that Nio's more affordable and higher-volume brand, Firefly, could bring in a fleet of new vehicles to match this new standard. This all sounds great, so where's the drawback?.The catch, if you want to call it that, is that competition with fast-charging stations is increasing as companies find ways to speed up the process. In fact, automakers are already hard at work to beat BYD's five-minute EV fast-charging benchmark. It's certainly a risky ambition to build out a capital-intensive network of battery-swap stations that may only save a few minutes compared to fast-chargers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-news-nios-massive-battery-121500559.html

While the company has made progress on deliveries and shown some improvement in margins, the bold target set by management to stabilize losses in Fiscal 2025 still feels out of reach, even with three quarters left..Easily unpack a company's performance  with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions.Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inbox  with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter.The upcoming launch of several new models with better margins, along with ongoing cost-cutting strategies, is the main hope for doubling margins by year-end..With Q1 results set to drop on June 3rd, I think investors will be watching closely for any shifts in margin trends or cost structure. That said, I remain skeptical that Nio can consistently maintain steady losses, move toward profitability, and generate healthy cash flow in such a short timeframe. For now, I’d rate the stock as a Hold..Investors are closely monitoring Nio’s investment thesis, which hinges on the company achieving financial breakeven by 2025 and potentially turning profitable by 2026..According to Nio’s CEO and founder, William Li, the company is expected to hit breakeven in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year based on three key factors: (1) the launch of nine new models to fully diversify the product portfolio; (2) the rollout of new vehicle technologies aimed at gradually boosting gross margins; and (3) perhaps the most challenging, the aggressive expansion of its battery swapping network, with plans to install stations in every county across China’s 27 provinces—an initiative that’s expected to drive sales..In Q1, Nio reported a solid 42,094 vehicle deliveries, marking a 40% year-over-year increase. The company is also seeing early momentum with its new Onvo and Firefly brands. Between March 19 and 27, out of 6,530 vehicles delivered, 2,690 came from these two brands, even though Nio had not officially started ramping up production of these new models yet. These brands are expected to play a significant role in helping Nio reach its ambitious profitability goals. Management has also reaffirmed its target to double deliveries in 2025 compared to the 2024 goal of 222,000 units..Still, Q1 financials raise some serious questions about how realistic the breakeven by year-end really is. Nio reported a net loss of $977 million, a 24% increase year-over-year, pushing its total projected loss for fiscal 2024 to between $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion—about 4% more than in 2023. Gross margins came in at 11.7%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-q1-earnings-could-reveal-201700243.html

The second is that Nvidia remains the dominant force in this market."".""However, with McKinsey predicting a spend of around $7tn to help data centres keep pace with processing demands out to 2030, the market is big enough to accommodate more than just one player,"" he added. ""Broadcom’s (AVGO) custom ASIC chips can help hyperscalers lower their average cost of data processing and as such it looks well set to grow its share of the market."".Read more: What's behind the surge in AI-related lawsuits?.Nathan said that consensus forecasts for Broadcom's (AVGO) second quarter revenue are broadly in line with the company's guidance of approximately $14.9bn, which works out to growth of around 19%..He highlighted that artificial intelligence (AI) is a ""growing share of Broadcom’s (AVGO) revenue base but there’s still more sales coming from non-AI workloads leaving the company exposed to cyclical ups and downs, which is a risk in today’s macroeconomic environment. And with 20% of revenue coming from China, markets will be keen to hear the potential impact of export restrictions and tariffs.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-lululemon-british-american-tobacco-dr-martens-remy-cointreau-stocks-to-watch-115059934.html

2025-05-28 21:23:00,China's EV Market Faces Brutal Test After BYD's Aggressive Price Cuts,BYD's aggressive price cuts are rattling China's EV giants. Margin squeeze and fierce competition threaten the sector's future.,"The world’s largest auto market is in trouble, and it’s taking some of its noted electric vehicle (EV) makers down with it. Shares of Chinese EV companies took a sharp hit recently, rattled by growing fears of a deepening price war and rising regulatory concerns. BYD Co Ltd. BYDDY plunged more than 9% yesterday to close at $107.33, while NIO Inc. NIO, XPeng XPEV, and Li Auto LI also ended the day in the red, down 3.4%, 3.3%, and 2.3%, respectively. This didn’t seem like just another bad day—it looked like a sign of bigger trouble ahead..At the center of the storm is BYD, China’s EV juggernaut. On the surface, its latest move looks like a gift to consumers—price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June. Its budget-friendly Seagull hatchback now starts at just 55,800 yuan (about $7,765), and the sleek Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan saw its price slashed by a whopping 34%, now starting at 102,800 yuan. Earlier this year, BYD rolled out cheaper versions of its Han sedans and Tang SUVs, trimming prices by over 10%..BYDDY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..But this aggressive pricing strategy comes at a cost. With razor-thin margins and intensifying competition, China’s EV industry is caught between growth and profitability. BYD’s price cuts might boost volumes, but they’ll undoubtedly squeeze profit margins. And that’s not just for itself; the price war will likely erode margins for every other player trying to stay in the race..Li Auto saw its vehicle margin slip from 22.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 19.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024. That’s a red flag in a market where efficiency and pricing power are key to survival. NIO, on the other hand, has worked to improve its vehicle margins and even set a goal of hitting 20% for its namesake brand this year. But with BYD dragging prices down across the board and others likely to follow suit, that target suddenly looks overly ambitious..Then there's XPeng. While it managed to nudge its vehicle margin up from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 10.5% in the first quarter of 2025, the sustainability of that progress is questionable. XPeng, like NIO, still isn’t profitable, and every yuan shaved off car prices pushes breakeven further out of reach. NIO has publicly aimed to reach profitability by the end of 2025, but with this stiff pricing competition, that goal gets murkier.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-ev-market-faces-brutal-132300801.html

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","NIO Inc. (NIO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this company have returned -11.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, to which NIO belongs, has lost 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +38.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.16 points to a change of +23.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.9%..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.49 indicates a change of +57.2% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.1%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NIO is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)..The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-nio-inc-130013035.html

We break down what drives each and which EV stock deserves your attention today.","For years, Tesla TSLA has been the face of the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. Today, it’s still a giant, with a staggering $1 trillion market cap and a growing focus on technology — from robotaxis to artificial intelligence. But the road ahead isn’t as smooth as it once seemed. Rising competition, shifting political dynamics, and missed or delayed timelines have taken some shine off Tesla’s once-unshakable dominance..On the other hand, there is NIO, Inc. NIO — often dubbed the “Tesla of China”— which has been on its own wild ride. The company’s market cap might be a fraction of Tesla’s, at just over some $8 billion, and it’s still not profitable. However, it operates in China, the world’s largest and most EV-friendly market. And while challenges remain, NIO seems to be inching forward with a clearer focus and renewed energy..No doubt, Tesla is aiming big and positioning itself more like a tech powerhouse than just a carmaker. But NIO is also doubling down on the EV game in a supportive domestic environment. With U.S. President Trump’s tough stance on EVs and shifting investor expectations, the race is far from over..Shares of both Tesla and NIO have declined year to date, underscoring the cautious mood around EV stocks..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Let’s delve into the key drivers and challenges to assess which stock deserves a spot in your portfolio now..NIO may be a small player compared to global giant Tesla, but the Chinese EV maker is stepping up its game. Its growing vehicle lineup — including models like the ES6, ET5T, ES8, ET9 — is helping the company expand its footprint in the competitive electric vehicle landscape..But NIO isn’t relying solely on its namesake brand to drive future growth. It has launched two sub-brands — ONVO, which targets the mainstream EV market, and Firefly, aimed at smaller premium vehicles. ONVO’s first model, the L60, is already on the roads and receiving positive feedback. Two more ONVO vehicles, the L90 and a yet-to-be-named model, are set to hit the market later this year, potentially widening NIO’s customer base. Firefly’s first model commenced deliveries last month..In the first quarter of 2025, NIO delivered over 42,000 vehicles — a 40% jump year over year. Management aims to double deliveries in 2025, powered by new models and broader brand reach. The company’s signature battery swap technology remains a key differentiator, with more than 3,200 stations and a new partnership with battery giant CATL to expand the network further..Vehicle margins are improving. The metric rose steadily through 2024, reaching 13.1% in the second half, and NIO is aiming for a 20% margin this year for its core brand. Still, challenges remain. NIO reported a net loss of more than $3 billion in 2024, and while management targets breakeven by the fourth quarter of this year, intense price competition in China and high operating costs pose a risk to that goal. Rising SG&A expenses and a stretched balance sheet—with shrinking cash reserves and high debt—add further pressure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-vs-tsla-ev-stock-150600150.html

After soaring to an impressive high of $67 per share in early 2021, the stock has investors buzzing with excitement. But since then, the narrative has shifted..Amid the volatility, Nio is making strides in China's fiercely competitive electric vehicle (EV) market, which is poised for explosive growth, projected to grow by 16% annually by 2030..With the stock currently down 94% from its peak, you may be wondering: Is now the time to invest in Nio? Let's dive into the company, its growth, and competitive landscape to find out..In April, Nio achieved impressive delivery growth, rolling out 23,900 vehicles -- a 53% increase compared to the previous year. This growth spanned its diverse brand portfolio, which includes Nio's premium smart EVs (19,269 units) and Onvo, its family-oriented line (4,400 units)..Nio also launched deliveries for its new brand, Firefly, a compact, smart, high-end EV designed for drivers seeking an affordable solution. With a starting price of $16,410, Firefly aims to compete with established European city cars like the Renault 5. It plans to launch Firefly in Europe this summer..Looking ahead, Citi forecasts that Nio could deliver 63,000 units in the second quarter, representing 50% growth quarter over quarter. This projection highlights Nio's expansion strategy and shows it continues to capitalize on the demand for EVs..Another unique aspect of Nio's business is its battery-swap service, which addresses one of the biggest concerns among EV users: charging time. While conventional charging can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, Nio's battery-swap technology allows drivers to replace their depleted battery with a fully charged one in just 3 to 5 minutes..Nio's battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model allows customers to purchase vehicles without a battery, significantly lowering the initial cost. Customers subscribe to the battery-swap program, which can provide recurring revenue for Nio while also addressing customer concerns about battery depletion.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-stock-buy-now-121500031.html
2025-05-25 16:05:00,"Nio Stock: 3 Reasons to Buy, 3 Reasons to Sell",The Chinese electric vehicle maker remains a divisive stock.,"Nio’s stock has plunged nearly 40% below its IPO price..The bulls believe its accelerating deliveries, rising margins, and low valuation make it a compelling buy..The bears aren’t impressed by its persistent losses, high debt, and competitive headwinds..10 stocks we like better than Nio ›.Nio (NYSE: NIO), a leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs) in China, was once a hot growth stock. Its American depositary receipts (ADRs) closed at a record high of $62.84 on Feb. 9, 2021, a 10-bagger gain from its initial public offering (IPO) price of $6.26 on Sept. 12, 2018. At the time, investors were impressed by its explosive growth, expanding vehicle margins, and unique battery swapping technology..But today, Nio's stock trades at less than $4. It ran out of juice as its deliveries slowed down, its vehicle margins declined, and it racked up more losses. Rising interest rates, tariffs, and the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China exacerbated that pressure..So, should value-seeking investors consider buying Nio's stock today? To find out, let's review the three reasons to buy and the three reasons to sell..The bulls think Nio is primed for a recovery for three reasons: Its deliveries are accelerating, its margins are stabilizing, and it looks dirt cheap relative to its growth potential..Deliveries more than doubled in both 2020 and 2021, but only increased 34% in 2022 and 31% in 2023. It attributed that deceleration to its supply chain constraints, tougher competition, and China's economic slowdown. But in 2024, its deliveries rose 39% to 221,970 vehicles. In the first four months of 2025, they increased 44.5% year over year to 65,994 vehicles..That acceleration was fueled by its gains in market share in China through its flagship ET-series sedans and new Onvo SUVs -- which were buoyed by its subsidies for repeat customers and discounts on older vehicles -- along with its gradual expansion into Europe. It also started delivering its first Firefly compact cars and premium ET9 sedans in April..Nio's annual vehicle margin dropped from its peak of 20.2% in 2021 to 9.5% in 2023. That decline, which was caused by a pricing war across the cooling EV market, convinced many investors that its days were numbered..But in 2024, its vehicle margin expanded to 12.1% as it reduced its material costs, used more in-house components (including its own smart-driving chips), streamlined its production, restructured some of its businesses, and sold more higher-margin sedans and SUVs. Those improvements offset a lot of the pressure from its subsidies, discounts, and European tariffs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-stock-3-reasons-buy-080500907.html

(NIO) closed the most recent trading day at $4.04, moving -1.46% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.09%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.32%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.02%..Prior to today's trading, shares of the company had gained 16.48% over the past month. This has lagged the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 28.79% and outpaced the S&P 500's gain of 13.05% in that time..The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of NIO Inc. in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of -$0.22, marking a 38.89% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.71 billion, up 24.51% from the prior-year quarter..For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of -$1.13 per share and a revenue of $13.74 billion, signifying shifts of +25.17% and +50.41%, respectively, from the last year..Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for NIO Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability..Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system..The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

2025-05-16 21:00:00,Is Trending Stock NIO Inc. (NIO) a Buy Now?,"NIO (NIO) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","NIO Inc. (NIO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future..Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +13.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, which NIO falls in, has gained 7.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings..We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements..NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +38.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged..For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.13 points to a change of +25.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.48 indicates a change of +58.1% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NIO is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-nio-inc-nio-130015943.html

With bold EV plans and breakeven hopes, here's what investors should know before buying.","NIO Inc. NIO, once hailed as the “Tesla of China,” is now trading at just around $4 per share, down roughly 94% from its all-time high attained in 2021 and even below its 2018 IPO price of $6.26. For a company that once captured investor imagination with bold electric vehicle (EV) ambitions, the fall has been steep..In 2018, NIO's debut on the NYSE was met with considerable excitement. Fast forward to 2025, and the company is operating at a much larger scale with a wider vehicle lineup, new brand launches, and long-term plans still intact. Yet, the stock remains under pressure..So far in 2025, NIO shares have slipped nearly 8%. Meanwhile, domestic peers Li Auto LI and XPeng XPEV have surged 19% and 74%, respectively. XPeng, in particular, has gained traction thanks to its aggressive push into autonomous driving and robotics..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.From a valuation perspective, NIO currently trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.54, well below Li Auto’s 1.1 and XPeng’s 1.53.

That brings up a key question: Is the current discount an opportunity or a value trap?.Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Let’s delve into NIO’s growth drivers and challenges to evaluate if investors should park their cash in the stock at this time..NIO's vehicle lineup includes ES6, ET5T, ES8, EC6, ES7, ET5, ET7, EP9, EVE, ET9 and EC7 models. In late March 2025, the company commenced delivery of the NIO ET9. But it’s not just the namesake brand driving growth anymore. To tap into different segments of the EV market, NIO has launched two sub-brands: ONVO, targeting the mainstream market, and Firefly, aimed at smaller premium EVs..ONVO’s first model, the L60, has already hit the market and is seeing a positive response. The brand’s second model, the L90, is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2025, followed by the launch of a third ONVO vehicle in the fourth quarter. Firefly’s first model commenced deliveries last month..In April 2025, NIO delivered 23,900 vehicles, up 53% year over year. This included 19,269 units from the main NIO brand, 4,400 ONVO units and 231 Firefly vehicles. While the growth is encouraging, it still lags behind peers.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best high volume stocks..On May 9, BMO private wealth chief market strategist Carol Schleif joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy. Reflecting on a market decline in April that reached a ~20% drop, Schleif noted that the market recovered and ended only 3% to 4 % down. She described investor reactions during that period as mixed: about 10% were very eager to buy, but another 10% were quite nervous, while the majority remained measured. She emphasized the important distinction between markets and the economy and noted that markets often move ahead of economic realities and quickly shift focus to new topics as part of their discounting mechanism. This is why markets serve as economic indicators and anticipate future developments..She talked about how individual risk tolerance varies, with some younger clients adopting conservative strategies and some older clients favoring aggressive positions, especially in tech. Schleif acknowledged that tariffs are expected to rise from under 3% to ~10%, but despite this anticipation, she’s confident that markets and companies will adjust to the changes. She noted the unusual shift in US influence, which now extends beyond material control to more intangible domains, and described this shift in responsibility as significant and complex. Schleif also emphasized the value of globally diversified portfolios, which have been challenging to maintain during periods when the US market outperformed. However, she noted that such diversification, which includes fixed income and foreign equities, has provided better performance and protection year-to-date and helps investors weather volatility better than those concentrated solely in US assets..We first used stock screeners to compile a list of stocks with high average 3-month volumes.

Additionally, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” have been halted due to other companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks, including a company that has applied for numerous trademarks related to aftermarket Cybertruck accessories, O’Kane writes.

2025-05-13 22:43:00,Best EV & AV Stocks to Electrify Your Portfolio Now,"If you wish to capitalize on the electric and driverless future of mobility, consider adding stocks like Rivian, BYD and NIO to your watchlist.","An updated edition of the March 21, 2025, article..The auto industry is in the middle of a historic shift, and electric vehicles (EVs) are driving the change. While headlines today are filled with the talk of tariffs under the Trump administration, the long-term outlook for the EV industry looks bright. Global sales of electric vehicles are expected to grow 19.2% this year, per Autovista Group. It projects EV sales to hit 21.3 million units this year, with China leading the charge. Long-term expectations depict EVs could make up over 40% of global light vehicle sales by 2030, and more than 80% by 2040..Till a few years ago, Tesla TSLA was the only name most people associated with EVs. It was the standout player, bringing innovation and real-world usability to electric cars. But now, the field is getting crowded. Traditional carmakers like General Motors GM, along with startups like Rivian Automotive RIVN and Chinese EV makers like BYD Co Ltd BYDDY and NIO Inc. NIO, are all forging ahead with significant investment and ambitious product plans. This push is driven by environmental concerns, tougher emissions rules and rapid progress in battery range and charging speed, making EVs more appealing drivers..At the same time, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gaining ground. Full self-driving cars aren’t ready for the mainstream yet, but big steps are being made. Tech leaders like Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo and other automakers are investing heavily in AV tech. These vehicles could make roads safer by reducing accidents caused by human error, while also easing traffic congestion. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving is steadily inching closer to everyday use. The AV market is expected to grow from nearly $48 billion in 2025 to more than $133 billion by 2030..This dual transformation — electrification and automation — is creating major investment opportunities. EVs and AVs are no longer concepts of the future; they’re shaping the present and redefining what mobility looks like. For investors, this space offers growth, innovation and long-term potential.

Interested investors should add BYD, Rivian and NIO to their watchlist..Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and uncover your next big opportunity..Rivian went public in 2021, and it was seen as one of the most exciting new names in the EV space.

(NYSE:NIO) stands against the other small-cap EV stocks..In 2024, electric vehicles (EVs) represented 8.1% of the 16 million vehicles sold in the United States, according to Cox Automotive. While this was a record share, it was still below the 10% that analysts had expected at the beginning of the year. Despite this, some believe that the EV market may be picking up pace..READ ALSO: 11 Stocks That Will Bounce Back According To Analysts and 11 Best Stocks Under $15 to Buy According to Hedge Funds..Despite the fact that overall EV adoption has been slower than expected, brands like Cadillac are expanding their electric lineup. By the end of 2025, Cadillac plans to offer five EVs. These include the Escalade IQ, Optiq crossover, Lyriq, the upcoming three-row Vistiq, and the luxury Celestiq. Cadillac expects roughly one in three vehicles it sells in the US this year will be all-electric..Brad Franz, Cadillac’s director of marketing, told CNBC that the company is launching EVs to grow its business and attract new customers to the brand instead of just shifting sales from gas-powered cars. According to Franz, the EV portfolio will offer customers more choices. In 2024, the company sold about 29,000 EVs. For 2025, Cadillac aims for EVs to make up between 30% to 35% of its sales in the US..However, Cadillac has abandoned its earlier plan to sell only EVs by 2030. Instead, the company said that customer demand will determine the elimination of gas-powered vehicles..This approach reflects a broader trend. A number of automakers have turned their back on plans to exclusively sell EVs in the near future as customer adoption has not been as fast as expected..To compile our list of the 12 small-cap EV stocks to buy now, we reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best small-cap EV stocks. Please note that we defined small-cap stocks as those with a market capitalization between $500 million and $10 billion.

(NYSE:NIO) stands against the other best High Growth EV stocks..Automobiles that run on electricity rather than gas are referred to as electric cars, or EVs. Electric car stocks consist of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. The electric vehicle business also includes companies that provide parts for electric vehicles, including batteries or autonomous driving systems..S&P Global Mobility estimates that around 7.36 million of the 16 million cars sold in 2024 were not made in the United States, showing that President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars, which have been in effect since March 2024, affect about 46% of the country’s auto market. On May 3, tariffs on some auto components, including engines and transmissions, went into effect..However, the administration unveiled a two-year relief plan in response to industry criticism. In the first and the second year, automakers that manufacture in the United States are allowed to deduct import tariffs on parts up to 3.75% and 2.5% of the suggested retail price of a car, respectively. Automobiles having at least 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican components are exempt; by 2025, the percentage will rise to 90%. The overlapping tariffs on commodities, steel, and aluminum from Mexico and Canada have been waived for businesses. Industry groups have issued warnings that the tariffs would increase market maintenance costs, lower sales, and boost car prices..Recently, according to the Cox Automotive report, in Q1 2025, sales of electric vehicles in the United States rose 11.4% year over year to around 300,000 units, making up 7.5% of all new vehicle sales, up from 7% in Q1 2024. New model launches fueled growth, with multiple brands either diversifying their EV lineups or making their first steps into the market. One significant automaker sold over 30,000 EVs, almost doubling its volume from the previous year. In Q1, another company that had not been involved in the EV market before contributed over 14,000 units. However, not all players grew; some established models experienced significant decreases as product strategies changed..However, the market for EVs is facing more challenges. A well-known EV brand had a 26% decline in sales from its 2023 peak of 173,000 units to 128,000 units in Q1, a 9% year-over-year decline, and a 3% decline in market share. Future growth is threatened by ongoing tariffs on vehicles and essential commodities like aluminum and battery supplies, as well as policy uncertainty.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-among-high-202627345.html
2025-05-09 21:58:00,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Tesla, NIO, Li Auto and XPeng","Tesla, NIO, Li Auto and XPeng are part of the Zacks top Analyst Blog.","Chicago, IL – May 9, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla's TSLA, NIO Inc. NIO, Li Auto LI and XPeng XPEV..Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:.Tesla's grip on the world's largest EV market is slipping. In April, the company sold just 58,459 vehicles in China, down nearly 6% from a year ago. The figure also reflected a steep 26% drop from March, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. In the first four months of 2025, Tesla's China sales have declined over 18% year over year to 231,213 units..The numbers are raising red flags. While local rivals are posting strong growth, Tesla is struggling with an aging product lineup and rising competition. The recent Model Y refresh did little to spark excitement, and public perception of the brand, soured by CEO Elon Musk's controversies amid his political moves, isn't helping..Weak delivery numbers across all key markets (including the United States, China and Europe) are making it harder to believe that Tesla can report sales growth for full-year 2025. Ongoing global tariff uncertainty and weakness in China remain concerns, prompting Tesla not to reaffirm its 2025 delivery guidance. Musk had already walked back his 2025 vehicle growth target from 20-30% to more modest expectations on the fourth-quarter earnings call. But now he has refrained from reiterating even that modest growth..Meanwhile, the excitement around its upcoming robotaxi reveal on June 1 may not be enough to distract from the core issue — falling EV sales. Tesla may call itself a tech company, but without strong vehicle demand, the story falls apart. Investors' patience on the stock is already running out and such weak numbers will only worsen things. Unless Tesla can reverse its sales decline, its stock could be in for a rougher ride..While Tesla deliveries in China dropped, companies like NIO Inc., Li Auto and XPeng saw a sales surge..NIO delivered 23,900 vehicles in April, demonstrating 53% growth on a year-over-year basis. The total deliveries comprised 19,269 units of the NIO brand itself. NIO's ONVO and Firefly brands are expected to boost deliveries further..XPeng's deliveries totaled 35,045 in April, increasing 273% year over year and exceeding 30,000 units for the sixth consecutive month. XPeng MONA M03's cumulative delivery surpassed 100,000 units, and its XPENG P7+ model achieved its 50,000th vehicle production milestone in just five months from its launch.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-tesla-135800623.html

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best low priced stocks to invest in for the long term..As per AllianceBernstein, tariffs and trade wars have impacted investors of late. While some asset classes were spared, the US small-cap stocks have been hard hit. Over the past 6 months, the Russell 2000 Index has witnessed a decline of over ~10%. That being said, the investment firm opines that equity markets continue to show signs of broadening, which can work in favor of small-caps over time. The small-caps have underperformed in part since they are perceived as being more economically sensitive as compared to their larger-company counterparts..The current circumstances are unique, says AllianceBernstein. Trade tensions can have a more significant impact on the broader US economy, but robust companies can still see earnings growth. The small-cap investors can also take a sigh of relief from the broadening market. The investment firm highlighted that, over the previous 30 years, small-cap performance remained particularly robust over the last 2 cycles of unwinding large-cap growth concentration, i.e., when markets start to broaden..The 10 largest stocks accounted for over half the market capitalization of the Russell 1000 Growth Index by 2024 end, exhibiting a record high in the market concentration. Despite the trend reflecting the signs of unwinding, the concentration remains much higher as compared to the previous peaks. As per AllianceBernstein, small-caps are well-placed to benefit from the declining market concentration..READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In..AllianceBernstein opines that, while broadening markets have resulted in improved small-cap returns, timing the turn can be a difficult task. Typically, economic recoveries have fueled such transitions. In a bid to capitalize on the broadening market with an uncertain beginning, the firm believes that the best approach is to emphasize higher-quality companies. High-quality stocks tend to see reduced drawdowns when there is a contraction in the economy, and more upside when it sees expansion..The firm also opines that small-cap stocks trade at extremely depressed valuations as compared to the larger companies, based on P/E ratios. Notably, the geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic worries have impacted the small companies. Without considering the company fundamentals, the investors have discounted potential hazards for such companies. Investing in firms exhibiting resilient business models can benefit along the road to recovery.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-best-low-083822671.html
2025-05-09 15:15:00,Should You Buy Nio While It's Below Its IPO Price?,The Chinese EV maker is gradually turning things around.,"Nio’s stock has plummeted far below its IPO price..Its deliveries are accelerating again and its margins are improving..It looks undervalued, but a lot of near-term headwinds are squeezing its valuations..10 stocks we like better than Nio ›.Nio (NYSE: NIO), a leading maker of electric vehicles in China, went public at $6.26 per ADR on Sept. 12, 2018. On Feb. 9, 2021, its stock closed at a record high of $62.84. Its shares surged more than 10-fold as it dazzled investors with its explosive growth rates..But today, Nio's stock trades at about $4. It tumbled as investors fretted over its slowing deliveries, declining vehicle margins, persistent losses, and the rising tariffs on Chinese EVs. So should investors accumulate the stock while it's languishing far below its IPO price?.Nio sells a wide range of electric sedans and SUVs. It differentiates itself from its Chinese competitors in three ways. First, its vehicles run on removable batteries, which can be quickly swapped out across its own network of battery swapping stations. That makes its vehicles appealing to drivers who hate waiting for their vehicles to charge..Second, it's expanding into Europe to gradually curb its dependence on the Chinese market. Lastly, it sells both high-end premium vehicles (its ET-series sedans) as well as low-end ones (its Onvo SUV and Firefly compact cars). That mix helps it reach a broader range of drivers..Nio's annual deliveries more than doubled in both 2020 and 2021. However, its deliveries only increased 34% in 2022 and 31% in 2023. It attributed that slowdown to tougher competition, supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, and China's economic slowdown. Its vehicle margin also dropped from a peak of 20.2% in 2021 to 9.5% in 2023..But in 2024, Nio's deliveries climbed 39% to 221,970 vehicles as its vehicle margin rose to 12.3%. That acceleration was driven by stronger sales of its flagship ET-series sedans and Onvo SUVs in China, market share gains, and ongoing expansion into Europe..Nio hasn't posted its full first-quarter earnings report or provided any exact guidance for 2025. However, its deliveries grew 44.5% year over year to 65,994 vehicles through the end of April..That growth was driven by brisk sales of its core Nio vehicles, its new Onvo L60, which closely resembles Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model Y; and the initial deliveries of its new Firefly compact cars, which target interest in smaller vehicles like Smart cars and BMW's Mini. Its margins are also improving as it sells more of its higher-margin premium vehicles.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-nio-while-below-ipo-071500953.html
2025-05-08 21:41:00,Tesla's China Sales Slump Again: Is Investor Patience Wearing Thin?,"TSLA China sales plunge in April, defying the surge seen by local EV rivals, further reinforcing its losing dominance in the world's top EV market.","Tesla’s TSLA grip on the world’s largest EV market is slipping. In April, the company sold just 58,459 vehicles in China, down nearly 6% from a year ago. The figure also reflected a steep 26% drop from March, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. In the first four months of 2025, Tesla’s China sales have declined over 18% year over year to 231,213 units..The numbers are raising red flags. While local rivals are posting strong growth, Tesla is struggling with an aging product lineup and rising competition. The recent Model Y refresh did little to spark excitement, and public perception of the brand, soured by CEO Elon Musk’s controversies amid his political moves, isn’t helping..Weak delivery numbers across all key markets (including the United States, China and Europe) are making it harder to believe that Tesla can report sales growth for full-year 2025. Ongoing global tariff uncertainty and weakness in China remain concerns, prompting Tesla not to reaffirm its 2025 delivery guidance. Musk had already walked back his 2025 vehicle growth target from 20-30% to more modest expectations on the fourth-quarter earnings call. But now he has refrained from reiterating even that modest growth..Meanwhile, the excitement around its upcoming robotaxi reveal on June 1 may not be enough to distract from the core issue — falling EV sales. Tesla may call itself a tech company, but without strong vehicle demand, the story falls apart. Investors’ patience on the stock is already running out and such weak numbers will only worsen things. Unless Tesla can reverse its sales decline, its stock could be in for a rougher ride..While Tesla deliveries in China dropped, companies like NIO Inc. NIO, Li Auto LI and XPeng XPEV saw a sales surge..NIO delivered 23,900 vehicles in April, demonstrating 53% growth on a year-over-year basis. The total deliveries comprised 19,269 units of the NIO brand itself. NIO’s ONVO and Firefly brands are expected to boost deliveries further..XPeng’s deliveries totaled 35,045 in April, increasing 273% year over year and exceeding 30,000 units for the sixth consecutive month. XPeng MONA M03’s cumulative delivery surpassed 100,000 units, and its XPENG P7+ model achieved its 50,000th vehicle production milestone in just five months from its launch..LI Auto delivered 33,939 vehicles last month, up 31.6% year over year. In the first four months of 2025, Li Auto’s deliveries totaled 1,260,675 units..Shares of Tesla have lost more than 30% year to date.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-china-sales-slump-again-134100153.html
2025-05-07 17:53:00,Is Nio Stock a Millionaire Maker?,"Shares in Nio are down sharply from their all-time highs.  Let's explore the pros and cons of investing in Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) -- currently trading at around $4 per share -- as it struggles to differentiate itself in the increasingly competitive automotive industry.  Like many penny stocks, Nio is a falling star.","Shares in Nio are down sharply from their all-time highs..The Chinese EV maker faces challenging dynamics in its industry..Should investors see this as a buying opportunity?.10 stocks we like better than Nio ›.Some retail investors tend to love penny stocks (shares in companies trading under $5 per share) because of their explosive volatility and multi-bagger, millionaire-maker potential. However, a low stock price doesn't always mean a good deal because these companies are often cheap for a reason. .Let's explore the pros and cons of investing in Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) -- currently trading at around $4 per share -- as it struggles to differentiate itself in the increasingly competitive automotive industry. .Like many penny stocks, Nio is a falling star. The company launched its initial public offering (IPO) in 2018 at $6.26 per share before soaring roughly tenfold to an all-time high of $64.84 amid EV industry optimism in 2021. However, the good times didn't last. Nio's shares have now fallen by 94% to $4.04 at the time of this writing as challenges like competition, margin pressure, and lackluster growth weigh on investor sentiment..China is the world's largest EV market, with electric and hybrid options representing more than half of new car sales in the country (compared to 18% in the U.S.). But this potential opportunity has slowly been eroded by excess competition. According to CNN, the country boasts more than 200 EV makers, leading to a massive oversupply of cars and a race to the bottom in pricing as different companies struggle for market share..It's hard to see this situation ending well. Even industry leaders like Tesla are struggling, with March sales in China down 11.5% year over year. A highly competitive environment will likely be even more challenging for smaller automakers like Nio because they have lower economies of scale advantages and are less able to absorb losses during a price war. .Nio's earnings highlight the complexities of the EV industry in China. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 15.2% year over year to RMB 19.7 billion ($2.7 billion), but profitability remains out of reach with an operating loss of $826.5 million. While this is down 8.9% from the prior-year period, it still looks like an unsustainable rate of quarterly cash burn, especially for a company with a market cap of just $9.1 billion..The only way out of this situation is scale. Nio will have to sell more cars to take advantage of economies of scale and reduce its fixed costs per unit. Management could pull this off by trying to expand outside of China through new brands and an aggressive export strategy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-stock-millionaire-maker-095300962.html

2025-05-05 21:00:00,NIO Inc. (NIO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Zacks.com users have recently been watching NIO (NIO) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.","NIO Inc. (NIO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term..Shares of this company have returned +16.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.4% change. The Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, to which NIO belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +38.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -80.8%..The consensus earnings estimate of -$1.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.2%. This estimate has changed -3.7% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.48 indicates a change of +58.1% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.7%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NIO is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-attracting-investor-130014108.html
2025-05-03 08:00:00,Nio is facing heavy competition in China’s fierce EV market. Making key design decisions ‘within hours’ could help it break through,"To keep ahead of the competition, “design really has to be leading edge, always looking forward, very progressive,"" says Kris Tomasson, Nio's VP of design.","China is the world’s most competitive market for electric vehicles. Startups and established carmakers are sparring on price, technology and, increasingly, design, as companies try to grab market share. Foreign visitors are often astounded by what Chinese EVs can do..“The EV market, especially in China, is incredibly competitive,” says Kris Tomasson, vice president of design for Nio, one of China’s leading EV startups. To keep ahead of the competition, “design really has to be leading edge, always looking forward, very progressive. So we’re given the ability to really push on the design side.”.Being design-forward means being agile enough to pursue new ideas quickly—with a helping hand from digital technology. “Key decisions that maybe would take months at a traditional carmaker, we can make within hours through our digital tools,” Tomasson says..Nio is now trying to use its design chops in releasing a new entry-level vehicle—dubbed “Firefly”—as it tries to break into the entry-level segment in both the Chinese and European car markets..William Li founded Nio in 2014; the company debuted its first car in 2016. The startup has focused on high-end vehicles, competing with companies like Tesla and fellow Chinese EV maker Xpeng. Nio has delivered over 737,000 cars in total through the end of April..Tomasson, who had previously worked at BMW, Ford, and Coca-Cola, was “one of the first 10 people brought on board, which made me realize how important design was going to be for this company going forward.”.Michael Tropper, cofounder of design agency Forpeople, was also brought into Nio early to work on “a once-in-a-career opportunity to build something from scratch.” He tried to focus on Nio’s offerings beyond the car itself, particularly the company’s battery-swapping stations..“This is the main worry everybody has about EVs: How am I going to charge the car? What if I run out of power?” Tropper says. Nio has since made its sleek, minimalist battery-swapping stations a “cohesive part of the brand experience,” Tropper says..The second unique aspect behind Nio are the “Nio Houses,” the company’s retail storefronts. The startup pitches these “houses” as community spaces for Nio drivers, including co-working spaces, libraries and cafes. “We took inspiration from private members clubs,” Tropper said. “I took William Li to Soho House here in London, and we really immersed ourselves into that world.”.Nio now has over 180 such spaces, mostly in China with a few in Europe and the Middle East. “A key element of differentiation for Nio is its service culture and care for the customer. We felt, very early, that a space where you host people is the best way to express that,” Tropper says. “The car industry can learn a lot from the hospitality industry.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-facing-heavy-competition-china-000000368.html

This includes firms that […]","We recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Promising EV Battery Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other EV Battery stocks..The term “EV battery stocks” describes businesses producing and developing electric vehicle batteries. This includes firms that provide energy storage solutions, supply battery components, and produce EV batteries..There is a market for reasonably priced electric cars. Investors can look into the companies making EV batteries, the most crucial and expensive components for EVs, to stay ahead of that demand. The need for EV batteries will rise sharply if the manufacturing of electric vehicles rises dramatically during the next ten years..To satisfy the need for batteries with greater capacity and cheaper costs, major manufacturers are making significant investments. New energy storage solutions being developed by battery technology start-ups, some of which are coming public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, have the potential to completely transform the market. EV battery stocks are a great investment option right now..The EV battery market is booming. As per a research report, the market for electric vehicle batteries was estimated to be worth $59.06 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2024 to 2032, from $67.78 billion to $111.20 billion. Asia Pacific held the largest regional share of the global EV battery market in 2023, with a valuation of $28.44 billion, and is anticipated to continue to do so for the duration of the forecast period. One of the main factors propelling the region’s market expansion is China’s soaring EV sales. As per the International Energy Agency, China accounted for the largest global sales of electric vehicles in 2023, with 8.4 million units sold..While the EV battery market is growing, the cost of EV batteries has dropped significantly in recent years, as per S&P Global, mostly due to declining prices for essential components like nickel, cobalt, and lithium. However, over the coming years, prices are anticipated to stabilize. For instance, the price of lithium carbonate dropped from around $70,000 per metric ton to less than $15,000 in 2024, while the price of cobalt dipped from $70,000 per metric ton in 2022 to about $30,000. While the global average price is predicted to increase somewhat in the second part of the decade, S&P Global Mobility forecasts that nickel cobalt manganese (NCM811) cell prices in Europe will decline by more than 7% between 2024 and 2030. This is caused by a strained raw material supply chain and unsustainable low profit margins for certain suppliers. NCM811 cells are currently cheaper in Greater China due to increased local production, while they are more expensive in Europe.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-among-most-030218047.html

Chung even thinks the stock is worth $8.10 per share, which would represent a more than 100% gain from where it traded at the time of his report..Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue ».Nio delivered about 42,000 EVs in the first quarter, a more than 40% year-over-year increase. Yet Chung still sees sales growth meaningfully accelerating from here. The new optimism comes after the company showcased its newest brands, Onvo and Firefly, at the 2025 Shanghai Auto Show last week..Its flagship Onvo L90 SUV also made its debut at the show. Both sub-brands are aimed at more of a mass-market EV buyer, offering lower prices without sacrificing many of Nio's leading EV technologies. The auto show impacted Chung's opinion on the stock. He wrote, ""After [the] Shanghai auto show, we expect NIO to launch new models much earlier than consensus expected."".That could mean 10 new models launching by the end of 2025. The analyst envisions that leading to more than 50% sequential delivery growth in the second quarter. He believes deliveries could soar to at least 63,000 units in what would be a record quarter..Chung thinks investors should buy Nio stock now, with the stock expected to trend toward his $8.10 price target as those models launch and upcoming delivery reports show improved data. While I agree that Nio sales should grow at increasingly faster rates moving forward, the stock itself may not react immediately..Investors buying now shouldn't be expecting a short-term move that the ""catalyst watch"" designation might imply. In the longer term, however, as sales figures show gains, Nio stock might react as Chung expects..Before you buy stock in Nio, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nio wasn’t one of them.

In contrast, the Dow Jones grew by 0.28 percent and the S&P 500 inched up by 0.06 percent..Meanwhile, 10 companies mirrored a broader market optimism, as investors snapped up shares ahead of their first-quarter earnings performance in the next few days..To come up with the list, we considered only the companies with a $2-billion market capitalization and $5-million trading volume..A fleet of eco-friendly electric cars, a symbol of the company's commitment to sustainability..NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) saw its share prices jump by 6.95 percent on Monday to close at $4.31 apiece following Citi Group’s bullish outlook, saying that it expects the company to post record vehicle deliveries..In its market note, Citi analyst Jeff Chung said that he expects NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) to deliver as many as 63,000 vehicles in the second quarter of the year, which would mark a 50-percent increase from the 42,000 cars it delivered in the first quarter..If realized, the figure would be the company’s highest delivery figure in history..Additionally, Chung underscored NIO Inc.’s (NYSE:NIO) ten new models to launch before the end of the year, saying that he believes the releases will come sooner than expected, especially following the Shanghai auto show, which revealed NIO’s aggressive rollout plans..In recent news, NIO entered into an agreement with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), one of the largest battery manufacturers in China, to develop a battery-swapping network across the mainland to help drivers avoid recharging slowdowns..Nio, a China-based electric vehicle manufacturer, said the deal with CATL would benefit passenger vehicles over a wide range of products, including unifying industry technical standards, enhancing capital and business collaboration, and providing efficient recharging solutions for users..Overall NIO ranks 4th on our list of the best performing stocks on Monday.

Inventory of older models should be cleared by mid-May, paving the way for the launch of four new vehicles under the 5-series and 6-series nameplates..“New 5-series and 6-series production cost should be further improved largely by enhancing the common auto-parts sharing potion, as well as simplified platform architecture,” analysts led by Jeff Chung said in a note..Additional launches include the third-generation ES8 and new models under the Onvo and Firefly sub-brands..Cost reductions are also a central theme in Citi’s thesis.

On one hand, it gives the company a unique competitive advantage since it has built out a leading battery-as-a-service network. On the other hand, it's quite an expensive endeavor for a company burning cash as profits remain in the distance..There are positive signs for the battery-swap strategy. Only recently, Nio saw demand for these services spike to a record high 136,720 swaps in a single day on Feb. 3. The period from Jan 28 to Feb. 4 was China's New Year Holiday, with travel peaking before and after the dates. Between Jan. 22 and Feb. 5, Nio provided over 1.7 million battery swaps, a strong 44% increase compared to the prior year..There are also signs that its customers prefer the option once they've tried it. During the previously mentioned time frame, 83.2% of the power added by Nio users on the highway came from battery swap stations. The even better news: This chunk of Nio's business and capital expenditures could break even by the end of 2026, according to a team at Chinese brokerage Western Securities..The problem with Nio's battery swap business currently is that there simply isn't enough volume of swaps to generate enough revenue to cover day-to-day operations. According to Chief Financial Officer Stanley Qu, a battery swap station can break even if it serves 60 to 70 motorists a day. That's exactly what should happen, according to the analyst team. As new brands and new models ramp up in production and deliveries, more Nio users will use the battery swap technology..Nio has come a long way since launching the first ES8 premium SUV in 2018. The company now sells a list of options under its premium brand Nio, and began deliveries of its second brand, Onvo, late in 2024. Its third brand, Firefly, is set to begin deliveries in 2025 while continuing to accelerate production throughout the year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-reasons-nio-buy-now-150000870.html

Trade between the U.S. and China has virtually halted for the time being, and that has given Chinese domestic automakers an advantage in their home market. American automakers like General Motors have been reporting strong growth for EV and hybrid sales in China. But rising tariff barriers are now affecting its joint ventures in the country, making it difficult to import some components..That provides an opening for names like Nio. At the same time, it is showcasing its newest brands, Onvo and Firefly, at the Shanghai show this week. CEO William Li told reporters that it was the first time each of its three brands were collectively represented at the show..The flagship Onvo L90 SUV also made its debut there. China's big auto shows are typically where EV makers showcase new technologies highlighting better-performing EVs at lower and lower prices.

Still, hitting 2025 targets is likely to be the key to winning investor trust.","NIO Inc. NIO stock has been on a wild ride lately. After sliding 17% last month — and falling nearly 9% in the first 13 trading sessions of April — this China-based electric vehicle (EV) maker seems to be showing signs of life. The stock has rallied 6.5% in the last two trading sessions, catching the attention of traders and long-term investors alike..So, is this the beginning of a meaningful turnaround, or just a short-lived bounce in an otherwise downward trend? With NIO facing intense competition in China’s EV space and broader market volatility, the stock is now 94% off its all-time high. In fact, it is currently trading below its IPO price of $6.26. Let’s delve deeper into the company’s growth drivers and challenges to find out how to play NIO stock now..In the first quarter of 2025, NIO delivered 42,094 units, up 40.1% year over year. The figure was within the guided range. Comparing the same with its closest peers— XPeng Inc. XPEV and Li Auto LI — the deliveries don’t seem that great.  During the quarter under discussion, XPeng delivered 94,008 smart EVs, which rose a whopping 331% from the corresponding quarter of the last year. Li Auto delivered 92,864 units in the first quarter of 2025, up 15.5% year over year. So, NIO has got some serious catching up to do..NIO's vehicle lineup includes ES6, ET5T, ES8, EC6, ES7, ET5, ET7, EP9, EVE, ET9 and EC7 models. In late March 2025, the company commenced delivery of the NIO ET9. Besides the namesake brand, the company has two more brands— a mainstream mass-market brand, ONVO, and a high-end small car brand, Firefly. ONVO’s first product, L60, has been well received, and its second product, L90, is expected to begin deliveries in the third quarter of 2025. ONVO’s third product will be launched in the fourth quarter. Firefly’s first model is set to commence deliveries on April 29. The expanding vehicle lineup is expected to boost sales volumes.  NIO expects deliveries to double in 2025, fueled by new model launches and brand expansion..NIO isn’t a profitable company yet. It incurred a net loss of more than $3 billion last year. However, the company expects its losses to narrow gradually this year amid sales growth and cost savings. NIO expects to break even in the fourth quarter of 2025..Vehicle margin — a key metric for EV companies —came in at 12.3% in 2024, up from just 9.5% in 2023. However, NIO couldn’t meet its target of achieving 15% vehicle margins by the end of 2024.For 2025, the company expects a vehicle margin of 20% for the NIO brand and 15% for the ONVO brand. If NIO is able to deliver that, it will be a huge improvement. However, given the intense EV price war in China and NIO’s failure to hit the 2024 margin target, that remains a “big if.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-stock-reverses-course-rises-132300924.html

So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.","NIO Inc. (NIO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock..Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -14.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, which NIO falls in, has lost 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?.While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making..Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock..Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements..NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +38.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -80.8%..The consensus earnings estimate of -$1.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.2%. This estimate has changed -9.5% over the last 30 days..For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.48 indicates a change of +58.1% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.1%..Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NIO is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-trending-stock-130015132.html

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best EV stocks to buy in 2025..Electric cars, often known as electric vehicles or EVs, are automobiles powered by electricity instead of gas. Electric car stocks are comprised of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. Firms that make components for electric vehicles, such as batteries or autonomous driving systems, are also regarded as part of the electric vehicle industry..President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported automobiles have officially come into force, affecting roughly half of the US auto industry. According to S&P Global Mobility estimates, 46% of the 16 million automobiles sold in the United States in 2024 were not produced domestically. The policy also includes tariffs on specified vehicle parts, including engines and transmissions, which will go into effect on May 3..Wall Street analysts and investors have been skeptical of the tariffs, which some say might reduce business earnings and plunge the automobile industry into a recession..Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska stated in a recent note to investors:.“A 25% on automotive imports lasting beyond four to six weeks would likely have a chilling effect on the entire sector as [automakers] need to grapple with significant impact to the bottom line.”.Wall Street analysts believe that automakers’ and suppliers’ equities will remain volatile in the near term. The most vulnerable businesses are those with high import ratios. Several companies saw more than 60% of their U.S. sales in 2024 come from vehicles manufactured outside of the United States. Meanwhile, companies with all-U.S. final assembly lines and minimal dependence on imports, especially in the EV industry, are projected to be more secure..In the first quarter, U.S. auto sales exceeded industry forecasts by a wide margin as buyers rushed to purchase new cars before the tariffs went into effect, which many believe will raise car prices. According to S&P Global Mobility’s tariff analysis, the costs of importing vehicles, auto manufacturing in the US, and consumer vehicle costs will all rise..Analysts warn that if tariffs are completely implemented, typical new car prices, which are currently around $48,000, might rise by up to $10,000. Lower-margin, entry-level vehicles are more vulnerable to price increases or discontinuation since they are often sourced from low-cost countries and are prone to margin compression under the new tariff regime.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-among-best-190717254.html

2025-04-14 20:46:00,Does XPeng's Global Push & AI Edge Make This EV Stock a Buy?,"Despite recent market volatility driven by trade war headlines, XPEV's core business remains strong and solid.","Chinese EV maker XPeng’s XPEV latest foray into Poland signals that the company has no intention of slowing down, even as geopolitical tensions escalate. Just days before the launch of three of its high-tech EVs in Warsaw—the G9 SUV, the G6 coupe SUV, and the P7 sedan—markets were rocked by a sharp escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, with tariffs on Chinese imports surging to 125%. Despite the noise, XPeng pushed forward. This move, part of its ambitious strategy to go global, points to its long-term vision. XPeng plans to be in 60 countries by the end of 2025..The vehicles launched in Poland all boast 5-star Euro NCAP safety ratings and cutting-edge technology like 800V fast-charging and NVIDIA-powered smart systems. While the tariffs caused the stock to dip 19% in the past month, this is more of a short-term reaction than a lasting headwind. Investors should stay calm and focus on the fundamentals..XPeng’s vehicle delivery numbers paint a compelling picture. In Q4 2024, it delivered 91,507 units—a 52% year-over-year jump. That momentum carried into 2025, with a record-breaking 94,008 vehicles delivered in Q1, representing a stunning 331% increase from the same quarter last year. Leading the charge is the Mona M03, a low-cost electric coupe starting around $16,000. This vehicle alone accounts for nearly half of total monthly sales..This way, XPeng is connecting with cost-conscious buyers by offering affordable options without compromising on quality or technology. This expanding delivery base is key to driving revenue growth and operational scale. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for XPeng’s 2025 revenues points to a 92% increase, while earnings are projected to rise 58%, offering a strong setup for investor confidence..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar..The story doesn’t end with volume. XPeng has also made significant progress on the margin front. In Q4 2024, vehicle margins improved to 10%, up from just 4.1% a year ago. While that’s still behind Li Auto’s LI 19.8%, it signals that XPeng is moving in the right direction. Cost-cutting measures and manufacturing scale are beginning to pay off. The gross profit shot up to RMB 5.8 billion in 2024 from just RMB 451 million the year prior. XPeng’s adjusted net loss margin has narrowed from -15.3% to -9.4%, showing that the company is inching closer to profitability. Management believes XPeng will hit breakeven by Q4 2025, and if this trend continues, that timeline seems increasingly realistic.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-xpengs-global-push-ai-124600491.html

Incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins will likely oversee the delisting issue when he officially assumes office, the author says, noting that such a move would come amid a trade war with China but also amid a growing GOP congressional appetite to delist Chinese companies. Chinese companies that publicly trade in the U.S. include Alibaba (BABA), Yum China (YUMC), Tencent (TCEHY), NetEase (NTES), PDD (PDD), Nio (NIO), Baidu (BIDU), and JD.com (JD)..DEAL ON TARIFFS: President Trump says the first deal with another countries regarding tariffs is “close.” He would like to come to agreement on a tariff deal with China, but if “we can’t make a deal, then we go back to where we were,” Trump added. The “EU is very smart, but they really have taken advantage of the United States,” Trump also stated. President Trump was speaking with reporters following a cabinet meeting..WATER OWED: President Donald Trump stated in a Truth Social post, “Mexico OWES Texas 1.3 million acre-feet of water under the 1944 Water Treaty, but Mexico is unfortunately violating their Treaty obligation. This is very unfair, and it is hurting South Texas Farmers very badly. Last year, the only Sugar Mill in Texas CLOSED, because Mexico has been stealing the water from Texas Farmers. Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to get South Texas the water it is owed, but Sleepy Joe refused to lift a finger to help the Farmers. THAT ENDS NOW! I will make sure Mexico doesn’t violate our Treaties, and doesn’t hurt our Texas Farmers. Just last month, I halted water shipments to Tijuana until Mexico complies with the 1944 Water Treaty. My Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, is standing up for Texas Farmers, and we will keep escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-trade-president-says-first-141031816.html

2025-04-09 22:37:00,NIO's Vehicle Margins Improve But the Stock Still Lags: Here's Why,"While NIO's vehicle margins are on the rise, the company needs to refresh its lineup, launch new models and boost revenues without relying on price cuts.","Chinese EV maker NIO Inc. NIO has made noticeable progress in improving its vehicle margins despite China’s fierce EV price war. In 2024, the company's vehicle margin rose to 12.3%, up from 9.5% in 2023. This was driven by stronger production volumes and cost optimization across its supply chain..Quarterly results also displayed steady improvement. Margins were 9.2% in Q1 2024, 12.2% in Q2 and 13.1% in Q3 amid lower material costs per unit, which were a key driver. While Q4 vehicle margin was flat compared with Q3, it was still not too bad, given the brutal price war in China. NIO targets a 20% vehicle margin for its namesake brand and 15% for its mass-market ONVO line in 2025..Yet, NIO is having a rough time on the bourses, with shares down 28% year to date..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Despite margin progress, NIO is still burning cash. It had only $2.6 billion in cash as of 2024 end, with $1.56 billion in long-term debt. Its high debt-to-capitalization ratio of 76% points to financial pressure. And let’s not forget NIO is still unprofitable..NIO is also spending heavily on its battery-swap network—a costly endeavor—while competitors focus on simpler charging models. Additionally, vehicle deliveries slipped to 42,094 units in Q1 2025 from 72,689 units in Q4 2024..Investors are seemingly waiting for more than just cost cuts. NIO needs to refresh its lineup, launch new models and boost revenues without relying on price cuts. Its overseas push, especially in Europe, also faces challenges, including tariffs..Until NIO proves it can grow profitably in this intensely competitive environment, the stock may continue to lag. While it is aiming for breakeven by the fourth quarter of 2025, it wouldn’t be an easy task..NIO’s closest competitors are LI Auto LI and XPeng Inc. XPEV..Li Auto’s deliveries are way higher than NIO’s. LI delivered 92,864 units in the first quarter of 2025, up 15.5% year over year. Looking at the vehicle margins, the metric for Li Auto was 19.8% in 2024, down from 21.5% in 2023 but still better than NIO. Last year, Li Auto generated an operating profit of $961 million and a net income of $1.5 billion, underlining its status as a profitable EV maker..Coming to XPeng, the company delivered 94,008 smart EVs in Q1 2025, which rose 331% from the corresponding quarter of last year. XPeng’s vehicle margin was 8.3% in 2024, compared with negative 1.6% in the prior year. XPeng’s cost reduction efforts resulted in a massive improvement.

2025-04-07 22:21:00,NIO or Li Auto: Which Chinese EV Maker Has an Edge Now?,"Li Auto leads with strong margins, sales and AV progress. NIO bets big on battery swaps but its unprofitability status is a big concern.","China's new-energy vehicle (NEV) market — comprising battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) — continues to sizzle. More than 11 million NEVs were sold in the country last year, up 40.7% from 2023, per China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). In the first quarter of 2025, sales of passenger NEVs in China were estimated at 2.86 million units, up 43% from the year-ago period, per CPCA..Government subsidies and rising consumer demand for cleaner transportation backed the growth. But as competition intensifies and a brutal price war rages, the question is which of the homegrown automakers is better positioned to navigate the road ahead — NIO Inc. NIO or Li Auto LI? Let’s take a closer look at both companies across several key parameters to assess which one currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now..Li Auto has built a strong reputation around its extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), a hybrid solution offering both EV benefits and range flexibility. Each of its popular L series vehicles — L6, L7, L8, and L9 — has delivered over 200,000 units. Last year, it launched its first pure battery electric model, the MEGA. Li Auto plans to launch additional BEVs including Li i8, i6, i7 and i9 over the next 12-18 months. Li i8 is expected to be launched in July, while i6 will be released later in the second half of 2025..Meanwhile, NIO has been focusing on building pure EV models only. NIO's vehicle lineup includes ES6, ET5T, ES8, EC6, ES7, ET5, ET7, EP9, EVE, ET9 and EC7 models. In late March 2025, the company commenced delivery of the NIO ET9. In December 2024, the company launched NIO 89— which will commence deliveries at the end of this month. Another major product from the namesake brand will be launched in the second half of this year.  Besides the NIO series, the company has two more brands— mainstream mass-market brand ONVO and high-end small car brand Firefly. ONVO’s first product, L60, has been well received, and its second product, L90, is expected to begin deliveries in the third quarter of 2025.

2025-04-05 20:45:00,What in the World Happened to Nio?,"It wasn't that long ago that Nio (NYSE: NIO) seemed poised to post a breakout fourth quarter.  It had a good third quarter when it improved vehicle margins amid a challenging environment, and it had launched yet another brand, Firefly, that was positioned to drive the top line even higher throughout 2025.  One of the largest reasons to buy into Nio's vision was that the previously mentioned new brands are set to drive deliveries higher and thus generate strong revenue growth.","It wasn't that long ago that Nio (NYSE: NIO) seemed poised to post a breakout fourth quarter..The Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker had delivery momentum driven by a new brand, Onvo, which began boosting deliveries at the end of 2024. It had a good third quarter when it improved vehicle margins amid a challenging environment, and it had launched yet another brand, Firefly, that was positioned to drive the top line even higher throughout 2025..But then Q4 largely disappointed Wall Street analysts and main street investors alike. So what happened?.One of the largest reasons to buy into Nio's vision was that the previously mentioned new brands are set to drive deliveries higher and thus generate strong revenue growth. While part of that worked according to plan, it's also true that it didn't drive top-line growth analysts expected during the fourth quarter..In Q4, vehicle deliveries checked in at 72,689. That figure breaks down into 52,760 vehicles from its premium Nio brand and the remaining 19,929 vehicles from its family-oriented smart EV brand, Onvo. The result was a solid 45% gain over the prior year's Q4 and a healthy 17.5% jump from 2024's Q3..However, that vehicle delivery growth didn't drive the top line quite as investors hoped. Total revenue jumped 15.2% from the prior year and increased 5.5% from 2024's third quarter. This suggests that while the company is indeed expanding its sales, China --Nio's primary market currently -- is still in the thick of a very brutal price war that's causing competitors to aggressively slash prices to maintain market share..While the top line remained sluggish compared to the company's delivery gains, there is a silver lining in the data. The vehicle margin checked in at 13.1% during Q4 compared to 11.9% during the prior year's Q4 and the same level as 2024's third quarter. This suggests that while the Chinese EV maker had to get more competitive on pricing, it was also able to reduce costs enough to salvage its margins..So, to summarize, Nio is expanding its sales and deliveries through new brand launches while simultaneously cutting costs to save its margins. Why wasn't Wall Street satisfied?.Nio's stock price had been on a steady rise through March right up until the company prepared to drop its Q4 results on the market. Nio's top and bottom line checked in lower than analysts estimated for Q4, but the main driving force behind the pessimism is likely the company's unenthusiastic guidance for 2025's Q1.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-happened-nio-124500218.html

2025-04-04 23:11:00,Why Nio Stock Plunged 17.7% in March,"The EV stock hit a 52-week low and is dirt cheap right now, but you must pay attention to a few things.","With Nio (NYSE: NIO) stock rallying 12% by the 18th of last month, investors thought shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker had finally bottomed. Unfortunately, their hopes were dashed soon after as Nio stock made a U-turn, hit a 52-week low, and ended March 17.7% lower, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence..A drop in deliveries, rising losses, and a share sale sent Nio stock tumbling in recent weeks. Nio's delivery numbers announced on March 1 were a mixed bag. Although its deliveries surged 62% year over year in February, they dropped 4.8% sequentially..Interestingly, while deliveries under Nio's flagship brand rose 15% over January, its mass-market sub-brand Onvo saw deliveries slip almost 32% sequentially. Days later, Nio reported a record net loss of $974 million for its fourth quarter, up 33% year over year despite 13% growth in vehicle sales..Nio's gross margin improved to 11.7% in Q4 from 7.5% in the year-ago quarter, but higher operating expenses ate into its bottom line as the company spent more money on marketing and promoting new brands and expanding its sales network..Nio's next announcement further hit the stock. Toward the end of March, Nio announced plans to sell nearly 136.8 million shares in offshore transactions for a price of 29.46 Hong Kong dollars per share. That meant a steep discount of 9.5% to the previous day's closing price on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Nio stock tumbled and hit a 52-week low of $3.57 on March 31..Nio is betting big on its sub-brands for growth. Onvo began deliveries of its first model, the L60 SUV, in September 2024 and is ready to launch its second model, the L90, in the coming weeks. Although Onvo deliveries fell in March, I'd wait for some quarters to see the trend since the beginning of the year around the Chinese New Year holiday is a seasonally weak period for auto sales. Meanwhile Nio's second sub-brand Firefly will launch its first model -- a compact hatchback -- on April 19..Nio's guidance also didn't disappoint. It expects to deliver between 41,000 and 43,000 vehicles in the first quarter, which would mean year-over-year growth of around 36% to 43%. Its Q1 revenue guidance also means potential growth of around 23% to 30% year over year..Nio's stock is about the cheapest it's ever been now on a price-to-sales ratio, but you'd want to keep an eye on its costs and financials as they could decide where the stock heads next. Nio says it is selling shares to raise money for research and development of EV technologies and new products, and to strengthen its balance sheet. I'd pay more attention to the latter, since Nio is burning cash, and its current assets even exceeded its current liabilities as of the end of the fourth quarter.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nio-stock-plunged-17-151111729.html

2025-04-01 20:00:00,Nio's Stock Is About the Cheapest It's Ever Been. 1 Thing to Know Before You Buy.,Nio is a dirt cheap EV stock to buy now.,"Nio (NYSE: NIO) stock has lost a staggering 41% of its value in just the past six months and is barely 6% away from its 52-week low, as of the time of this writing..At its current price, Nio stock is the cheapest it's ever been, trading at an only 0.8 times price-to-sales (P/S) ratio against its five-year average P/S of 2.5. That's a dirt cheap price to pay for an electric vehicle (EV) maker that's steadily growing its revenue in the world's largest EV market, China..But then the question is, why has Nio stock crashed despite growing its sales? That's something about Nio you must know before you buy the stock..Nio stock was enjoying a good run-up this year, gaining almost 19% through March 19 before giving up all of those gains, and then some. The EV maker released numbers for its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 on March 21, and the number miffed investors yet again..Although Nio's vehicle sales rose 13% year over year in Q4, its net loss surged 33%. Nio's net loss rose 8% to $3 billion in 2024, on revenue worth $9 billion..A price war in the Chinese EV market forced Nio to cut prices of its EVs multiple times over the past couple of years or so. That, alongside car platform upgrades, high input and marketing costs, and other nonoperating items, have eaten into Nio's bottom line. And, that's the biggest reason why Nio stock has fallen so much despite a growing top line..Nio's management, however, is trying to cut general expenses. The company has also launched its own autonomous driving chip and software to cut costs and reliance on third parties..Meanwhile, Nio recently launched its first mass-market brand, Onvo, to expand its market in China, and will launch the second model under it in the coming months.

Additionally, it highlights that current EV sales are heavily reliant on government subsidies, and infrastructure challenges, such as costly and insufficient public charging options, persist.

2025-03-29 16:19:00,Should You Buy Nio While It's Below $6?,"Nio (NYSE: NIO) is a fast-growing company looking to capitalize on China's growing electric vehicle (EV) market.  It has carved out a niche in the industry with its battery swap business.  Pricing wars have put pressure on margins, and the ongoing trade tensions in the U.S. and Europe weigh heavily on the business.","Nio (NYSE: NIO) is a fast-growing company looking to capitalize on China's growing electric vehicle (EV) market. It has carved out a niche in the industry with its battery swap business..However, the journey hasn't been without its challenges. Pricing wars have put pressure on margins, and the ongoing trade tensions in the U.S. and Europe weigh heavily on the business..A few years ago, Nio was the talk of the town, with its stock soaring to $67, but today, it is trading at around $4 per share. While some may view the stock as a bargain, prospective investors should carefully weigh several factors before diving into shares of this EV stock..Founded in 2014, Nio is an up-and-coming player in the EV market in China. With 160,038 sales a couple of years ago, Nio is China's fifth-largest pure EV brand with a 3% market share. For comparison, BYD Company made 1.3 million in sales, giving it a 25% market share, while Tesla sold 603,000 vehicles for an 11.7% market share..One of the company's more interesting features is its battery swap business. This is part of Nio's broader battery-as-a-service (BaaS) offering, where customers can buy the car without a battery and pay a subscription fee for battery access, which includes battery swaps. This sets it apart from many competitors and addresses one of EV owners' primary headaches regarding charging times..Nio has a network of battery swap stations where drivers can quickly exchange their depleted batteries for fully recharged ones. With this battery swap technology, cars pull in, robotic systems swap the battery, and the driver doesn't even have to leave the vehicle..This offering has a couple of advantages. First, swapping out the battery takes about five minutes, significantly faster than charging, which can take anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes. Second, users could upgrade their batteries as Nio develops them. The subscription is for 75 kilowatt-hour (kWh) or 100 kWh battery packs. In the last year, it has also made 150 kWh battery packs available to customers..One downside to the BaaS model is that it has required a lot of upfront investment in battery inventory, stations, and maintenance. However, as Nio sells more vehicles, it hopes that the utilization of these battery swaps will increase, too. Analysts at Western Securities, a Chinese investment bank, think this part of Nio's business could break even by 2026..Last year was a record for Nio, as the company delivered 221,970 vehicles. The company held a strong position in the pure EV market, with a 40% market share for those vehicles selling over RMB 300,000 (approximately $41,359).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-nio-while-below-6-081900030.html

2025-03-28 16:30:00,Better EV Stock: Nio vs. Rivian,Which of these electric vehicle stocks deserves more attention from investors?,"Nio (NYSE: NIO) and Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) were once two of the market's hottest electric vehicle (EV) stocks. Nio, the Chinese EV maker, which went public at $6.26 per American depositary receipt (ADR) on Sept. 12, 2018, surged tenfold to a record closing price of $62.84 on Feb. 9, 2021. Rivian, an American maker of electric pickups, SUVs, and vans, went public at $78 on Nov. 10, 2021. Its stock more than doubled to its highest closing price of $172.01 a week later..But today, Nio and Rivian trade at roughly $4 and $12, respectively. Both stocks plunged as they delivered fewer vehicles from year to year and racked up steep losses along the way. So should investors buy either of these out-of-favor EV stocks as a contrarian play?.Nio produces a wide range of electric sedans and SUVs in China, and it's been gradually expanding into Europe. It differentiates itself from its competitors with removable batteries, which can be quickly swapped out at its own stations instead of being slowly charged at traditional stalls..Nio delivered its first vehicles in 2018, and its annual deliveries soared nearly tenfold from 2019 to 2024. However, its growth decelerated in 2022 and 2023 as it grappled with supply chain issues, intense competition, and China's slowing economic growth. Its vehicle margin (its revenue from new vehicle sales minus cost of sales) also plunged from 2021 to 2023..Metric.2019.2020.2021.2022.2023.2024.Nio deliveries.20,565.43,728.91,429.122,486.160,038.221,970.Deliveries growth.81%.113%.109%.34%.31%.39%.Vehicle margin.(9.9%).12.7%.20.1%.13.7%.9.5%.12.3%.Data source: Nio..But in 2024, Nio's deliveries accelerated again as its vehicle margin expanded. That recovery was driven by its robust sales of ET sedans, ES SUVs, and EC crossovers, as well as its recent launch of its lower-end Onvo L60 -- which resembles Tesla's Model Y but starts at just 149,900 yuan ($20,542)..Nio also continued to expand across Europe in the shadow of higher tariffs. Lower material costs and higher sales of premium vehicles (including its ET7 Executive Edition sedan) offset its lower average selling prices and stabilized its vehicle margins..The company still has plenty of irons in the fire. It recently launched the Firefly, a compact electric hatchback aimed at smaller vehicles like BMW's Mini, which starts at just 148,800 yuan ($20,404) in China. It plans to launch the Firefly in Europe later this year, and it could shift some of its manufacturing to the European Union to counter the region's tariffs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-nio-vs-083000175.html

The EV maker announced a surprise offshore share sale of nearly 118.8 million new Class A shares, representing about 5.4% of its current float. The deal is priced at a sharp 9.5% discount to its last Hong Kong close, signaling urgency. Shares in the U.S. tumbled over 5.2% at 1.28pm today, adding to a monthlong slide of 12%and it's not over. This offering, aimed solely at non-U.S. investors under Regulation S, notably bypasses U.S. institutions, raising more questions than answers..Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NIO..On paper, the capital raise is meant to fund R&D for smart EV tech, boost liquidity, and keep the lights on. But let's not ignore the context: this comes just a week after a disappointing Q4 print. Nio missed both revenue and delivery targets, and its outlook for Q1 is even worse. Projected deliveries of 41,000 to 43,000 units fall miles short of the Street's 65,000+ estimate. Revenue guidance also trails expectations by a wide margin. In short: growth is slowing, costs are rising, and the cash burn is real..Yes, Nio needs capital to stay competitive. But this move screams weakness, not strength. The dilution is significantaround 5.4% of the company's valueand the choice to avoid U.S. markets hints at geopolitical caution or lack of investor appetite. Management included a telling caveat: the deal is subject to market conditions, suggesting they're aware of the chilly reception. For now, investors are bracing for more pain.

This comes as President Trump announced the latest round of tariffs on the auto industry, impacting Chinese auto stocks..Morning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills break down the news and Nio's stock movement..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here..Chinese automaker Neo planning to raise about $450 million via a share placement to develop its smart EVs according to report from Reuters. Now, this coming as President Trump's tariff announcement weighs on some of the Chinese auto stocks here. Neo though, and this is typical when you see some of the share dilution, ultimately, as they're kind of going through this $450 million raise. Neo shares are moving lower by about 7 and a half percent. I'm not sure if we can uh throw up a year-to-date chart for some of the Chinese used, well, not used car, but new car makers because there certainly has been a broader sentiment shift that we've been tracking over the course of the year-to-date scale for companies like Neo, companies like BYD. Uh at there, you're seeing BYD on the screen and this is what I'm talking about. Up 50% year-to-date and it's really the sentiment shift among some of the domestic consumers of those vehicles. Again, remember, if you do have any type of shift in mind share among those consumers, who are looking at some of the US options and saying, okay, well, we want to support more of the homegrown options, then that money will tend to flow towards the companies like BYD, the companies like Neo and some of the other domestic manufacturers within the Asia-Pacific region. .I I think it'll be fascinating to see what happens in the European markets in particular with these Chinese automakers, if they are able to continue to withstand any impact of these tariffs. We've already seen BYD eclipsing revenue from competitors like Tesla, specifically due to a big bump in sales in the European region. Will that continue to be true off the back of these tariffs and are these companies kind of primed to be able to handle that. I just quickly want to mention some individual company news for Neo disclosing plans to raise about $450 million US dollars through a share placement according to a Reuters report. So you can see that's perhaps also moving the stock today here. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chinese-automaker-nio-reportedly-raising-135728423.html

Currently, only a few provinces, like Quebec, have EV readiness requirements. The report discusses the need for stronger, unified policies across all levels of government to simplify regulations and increase accessibility to EV chargers, particularly as younger Canadians, who are more inclined toward EVs, are predominantly apartment dwellers.

2025-03-19 22:47:00,NIO's Next-Level Battery Swap Push: Time to Buy the Stock Now?,"NIO teams up with CATL to expand its battery swap network, aiming for an EV charging revolution. Should you buy the stock on this strategic move?","China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry is evolving at a breakneck pace. Battery swapping is emerging as a game-changing solution to charging challenges. Leading the charge is NIO Inc. NIO, which has taken another bold step forward by partnering with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (“CATL”), the world’s largest EV battery manufacturer, to supercharge its battery swap network..The deal was announced yesterday, ahead of NIO’s fourth-quarter results on Friday. NIO and CATL aim to jointly build the world’s largest and most advanced battery swap network for passenger cars. Given this development, is NIO stock a buy now ahead of its earnings report? Let’s find out..One of the biggest hurdles for EV adoption remains charging time. Unlike traditional charging stations, battery swapping allows drivers to replace depleted batteries with fully charged ones in just minutes — eliminating the hassle of long charging waits..While the concept of battery swapping has been around for years, it is finally gaining serious traction, particularly in China, where government policies and automaker investments are accelerating its growth. China aims to have over 16,000 battery swap stations by 2025, and by 2030, some experts predict battery swapping could account for up to 10% of the global EV market. With hundreds of millions of battery swaps expected annually, this presents a massive opportunity for NIO.The company operates the largest battery swap network currently, with 3,172 stations in place..The latest collaboration with CATL will reinforce NIO’s leadership in battery swapping. CEO William Li has called this a ""pivotal moment,"" underscoring the partnership’s significance in pushing battery swapping into a new phase of growth..The partnership will enhance battery swap network sharing across different brands and models, accelerating the adoption of battery swapping through unified battery standards. It will expand the deployment of CATL’s Choco-Swap technology into NIO’s upcoming Firefly brand. Additionally, the deal provides a financial boost to NIO and strengthens capital synergies, with CATL investing up to RMB 2.5 billion in NIO Power—the company’s energy division..Beyond battery swapping, NIO is making strides in multiple areas..Expanding Vehicle Lineup: NIO currently offers nine premium electric models under the namesake brand (ES6, ET5T, ES8, EC6, EL7, ET5, ET7, EC7 and ET9). It expanded beyond its luxury lineup with the launch of a more affordable ONVO brand last year. L60, ONVO’s first product, commenced deliveries late in September. The Firefly brand is also set to hit the market soon, targeting entry-level consumers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nios-next-level-battery-swap-144700907.html
2025-03-19 22:19:00,Is BYD's Ultra-Fast Charging a Game-Changer for the EV Industry?,"BYDDY takes the lead in the charging game, with its new EV tech promising 400 km of range with just five minutes of charging.","Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd BYDDY is making waves with a bold claim—charging an electric vehicle (EV) could soon take as little time as refueling a gasoline car. This could be a massive breakthrough in tackling one of the biggest hurdles to widespread EV adoption — charging anxiety..Range anxiety has long been a concern for EV buyers who still fear that their vehicle will run out of charge before reaching its destination. While EV range has improved, charging anxiety remains a significant barrier. No one wants to wait hours for their car to recharge or drive to a charging station only to find it occupied or out of service..BYD’s latest technology aims to change that. With its new ""Super e-Platform,"" BYD is making a huge leap forward in battery technology and charging speed. The company claims its latest batteries can achieve 400 kilometers (about 249 miles) of range with just five minutes of charging. The new system boasts a peak charging speed of one megawatt, making it the fastest mass-produced system available. If these claims hold up, BYD could be rewriting the rules of EV charging..BYD said that its Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV models will feature the Super e-Platform. The Han L starts at 270,000 yuan, while the Tang L SUV starts at 280,000 yuan. The company says the Han L is so advanced that it is comparable to a Formula E racing car. Both vehicles also come equipped with BYD’s latest God’s Eye smart-driving technology..BYD credits its breakthrough to several key innovations. The company has developed an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash charging terminal system.” This system ensures efficient heat management, which is critical for maintaining battery life and safety during ultra-fast charging..Another key development is BYD’s next-generation silicon carbide power chip, which has a voltage rating of up to 1500V, the highest in the industry. This chip enables faster energy transfer with reduced energy losses. Additionally, BYD’s new flash-charging battery includes ultra-fast ion channels that reduce internal resistance by 50%, helping to speed up charging times..The company has also introduced a high-speed 30,000 RPM motor. According to BYD, this not only improves vehicle speed but also reduces the motor’s weight and size, enhancing overall power efficiency..To support this new technology, BYD plans to build over 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations across China. This expansion will ensure that drivers can take full advantage of the Super e-Platform’s charging speeds.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/byds-ultra-fast-charging-game-141900396.html

Over the last two years it has established battery swapping partnerships with a number of local automakers, including Geely, Changan Auto, Chery, GAC Group, FAW Group and JAC, reflecting its efforts to-date to standardize swapping technologies and establish battery swapping as a viable alternative to charging..CATL and Nio are now looking to promote the standardisation of EV battery swapping technologies across their respective networks and accelerate the adoption of battery swapping services across the country. Ultimately, they aim to “drive the formulation and adoption of national standards for battery swapping technology in China.”.CATL confirmed in a statement that the two companies have agreed to “create the largest and most advanced battery swapping service network for passenger vehicles, leveraging their respective strengths in technology, management, platforms and brand influence.”.CATL said it will support Nio in further developing its battery swapping network, based on its own Choco-Swap technical standards and network.

While the impact of cold temperatures on EV performance is widely recognized, the report reveals additional factors such as altitude, snow, rain, and in-car climate control that also significantly influence range. Contrary to popular belief, California, despite its high EV adoption rate, does not offer the most favorable conditions for long-range driving due to summer heat and wind. The report, which features data from March 2024 to February 2025, highlights state-specific impacts, with Arizona leading in favorable conditions due to its warm weather and lower air density, whereas cold spells have considerably reduced range in states like North Dakota and New England.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best penny stocks to buy according to billionaires. Can Small-Cap Stocks Overtake Large-Caps in 2025? On February 14, Morningstar released a report […]","We recently published a list of 15 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.  In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best penny stocks to buy according to billionaires..On February 14, Morningstar released a report on its outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025. The research highlighted the potential for small-cap stocks to outperform in 2025, driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions, valuation discounts, and sector-specific opportunities..The report noted that small-cap companies are more sensitive to short-term interest rate movements due to their capital structure. When central banks cut rates, debt servicing costs for these firms decrease, improving their financial position and potentially leading to better performance. Historically, interest-rate cuts have been associated with positive returns in the small-cap segment. Quoting an example of Australia, the report highlighted that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has recently shifted to a dovish stance, with interest-rate cuts expected in 2025. This anticipated reduction of up to 0.75% by year-end could renew investor interest in Australian small caps..Moreover, currently, small-cap stocks are trading at significant discounts compared to large-cap counterparts. As per the report, such valuation gaps have historically preceded strong price appreciation for small caps, especially when market sentiment improves. If we look internationally the small and mid-cap equities are trading at a Price/Earnings ratio of 16.4x compared to 19.2x for the MSCI World Index. Morningstar believes that If small and mid-cap valuations revert to their historical premium over the broader market, they could trade at a P/E of 20.2x. Therefore, projections indicate that small caps are set to experience higher earnings growth than large caps in 2025, offering robust returns for investors seeking growth opportunities. In addition, the report noted that the global reshoring trend, where multinational corporations bring supply chains back to domestic markets, is also expected to benefit small caps operating locally. This shift could also spur mergers and acquisitions, as larger firms seek smaller businesses to capitalize on reshoring benefits..Lastly, periods of heightened market concentration have historically led to outperformance by small caps. The current market climate suggests that this trend might continue, rewarding investors who focus on smaller, agile companies.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-among-best-191919536.html

In 2024, Institutional Investor ranked Ross No. 1 in his field for the seventh straight year. He was named to Institutional Investor's All-America Research team for the 10th year in a row..In studying Tesla's stock chart, Ross points to several factors in determining a potential oversold bounce in Tesla in the near term..First, its current relative strength index (RSI) is at 32..The RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a stock's recent price changes in a bid to estimate overbought or oversold conditions..When Tesla's stock hit a record high in early December after President Trump's reelection, shares boasted an RSI of 72. The gap between Tesla's current RSI and the level hit at the highs suggests that a lot of bad news on demand has been priced into the stock — and how little in the way of positive news is being factored in..Meantime, Tesla's stock is trading below its key 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving average — a major sign of lost momentum among traders — and at a noteworthy haircut to its record market cap of more than $1 trillion..Tesla's market cap at the moment is $804 billion..Ross explained, ""When you take a trillion-dollar company and you give it a 32 RSI and you take 55% out of the market cap, that's extremely oversold condition. I would just say the risk-reward is compelling when you have that technical backdrop in terms of price and momentum at extreme levels."".Despite the charts signaling a bounce in Tesla, the bulls will have to overcome a firm bear narrative at the hands of weak fundamentals..Tesla sold just 26,677 vehicles in China's market in February, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked an 11.16% drop year over year and a 20% decline from January..At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 72% year over year in February..In the US, prices on used Cybertrucks, Model 3s, Model Ss, Model Ys, and Model Xs continue to drop. Tesla is facing increased EV competition from General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), while some consumers are opting for hybrids.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-stock-looks-extremely-oversold-this-top-markets-technician-says-190820117.html

L60 is cheaper than EV giant Tesla’s TSLA Model Y in China, giving tough competition to TSLA’s Model Y in the country..Revenues for the quarter to be reported are expected to have benefited from increased deliveries.

2025-03-17 06:54:00,Could Buying Nio Stock Today Set You Up for Life?,"The Chinese EV maker looks undervalued, but can it impress the bulls again?","Nio (NYSE: NIO) has been a wildly volatile stock since its IPO in 2018. The Chinese maker of electric vehicles went public at $6.26 per share, and it skyrocketed tenfold to a record high of $62.84 during the buying frenzy in meme stocks in February 2021..However, as of this writing, Nio's stock trades at about $5 per share. The bulls retreated as its deliveries cooled off, its margins shrank, and it racked up steep losses. Could scooping up some shares of this unloved stock below its IPO price help set you up for life?.Nio produces a wide range of electric sedans and SUVs. It differentiates itself from its competitors with its swappable batteries, which can be quickly replaced at its own battery swapping stations as a faster alternative to traditional chargers..Nio delivered its first vehicles in 2018, and its annual deliveries surged nearly 11-fold from 2019 to 2024. But after more than doubling its annual deliveries in 2020 and 2021, its deliveries decelerated significantly in 2022 and 2023 as it struggled with supply chain constraints, tougher competition, and China's economic slowdown..Metric.2019.2020.2021.2022.2023.2024.Deliveries.20,565.43,728.91,429.122,486.160,038.221,970.Growth (YOY).81%.113%.109%.34%.31%.39%.Data source: Nio. YOY = Year over year..Nio's annual vehicle margin, which had reached a record high of 20.2% in 2021, also shrank to 13.7% in 2022 and 9.5% in 2023 as its pricing power waned. Its annual net loss more than quadrupled from 2021 to 2023. All of those challenges -- along with trade tensions and rising interest rates -- drove away bulls..After two years of slowing growth, Nio's growth in deliveries accelerated again in 2024. Its business stabilized as it grew its market share in China and expanded in Europe..That recovery was driven by its stable sales of its ET sedans, ES SUVs, and EC crossovers, as well as the launch of its lower-end Onvo L60, which resembles Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model Y but starts at just 149,900 yuan ($20,646). It also continues to expand across Europe even as it faces higher tariffs on Chinese-made EVs across the region..But despite that pressure, Nio's quarterly vehicle margins stabilized in 2024, growing from 9.2% in the first quarter to 12.2% in the second quarter and 13.1% in the third quarter. It expects that figure to rise again to 15% when it posts its fourth-quarter earnings report on March 21. It attributes that recovery to its lower material costs and its rising sales of premium vehicles (including its ET7 Executive Edition sedan) in China, which largely offset its lower average selling prices.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buying-nio-stock-today-225400556.html

2025-03-11 23:55:00,Why Nio Stock Surged Higher Today,"Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) shot higher by as much as 11.4% this morning.  The move pushed Nio's American depositary shares to their highest level of the year.  After paring some of that early jump, Nio shares were still higher by 10.4% as of 11:30 a.m. ET.","Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) shot higher by as much as 11.4% this morning. The move pushed Nio's American depositary shares to their highest level of the year..After paring some of that early jump, Nio shares were still higher by 10.4% as of 11:30 a.m. ET..Today, Nio let investors know that it will be reporting its critical fourth-quarter and full-year financial data before the opening bell on Friday, March 21. Investors already know the company's EV delivery data. Last year was a big year for the company capped off by record monthly EV deliveries of over 31,000 in December..But investors really want to hear what the company says about its two new mass-market brands, Onvo and Firefly. Onvo sales have begun, and Firefly has started taking preorders. Nio calls Firefly ""a small, smart, electric high-end car targeting urban lifestyle users."" It is priced as low as about $20,500..Additionally, the company has been steadily increasing its vehicle margin from 9.2% in the first quarter to 13.1% in the third quarter. That metric has been helped by higher sales volumes. Nio's 2024 deliveries increased by 39% versus 2023, and that continued over the first two months of 2025 with a nearly 50% year-over-year rise. If margins continue to increase as volume ramps up, investors will finally see a path to profitability for Nio..Nio also announced the expansion of a strategic partnership yesterday. The EV maker and automotive coatings specialist BASF Coatings — a subsidiary of German chemical company BASF — announced a letter of intent to hold ""annual strategic dialogues"" that focus on the exterior coatings of Nio vehicles..Investors hope that is a sign of future efficiency and cost improvements as well as possibly adding to its product offerings. Nio's upcoming earnings and discussion on the state of its business have investors feeling optimistic today, pushing shares to 2025 highs..Before you buy stock in Nio, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nio wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE:NIO) stands against the other EV stocks..The year 2024 marked a significant milestone for environmentally friendly vehicles in the US. On January 16, 2025, CNBC reported that for the first time, sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models made up 20% of all new car and truck sales. Motor Intelligence reported that over 3.2 million electrified vehicles were sold last year. This included 1.9 million hybrid vehicles and 1.3 all-electric vehicles..Traditional vehicles with gas or diesel engines continued to dominate the market, accounting for 79.8% of sales. However, this marked the first time their share fell below 80% in modern automotive history..READ ALSO: 10 Cheap Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 High Growth Energy Stocks To Invest In..In the US, the EV market is very competitive. Out of 68 mainstream electric models tracked by Kelley Blue Book, 24 models posted an increase in sales compared to the previous year while 27 models experienced a decrease in sales volume. Additionally, 17 new models were introduced to the market..There is not enough clarity as to how sales of all-electric and hybrid electric vehicles will perform in 2025. This uncertainty is partly due to pending potential actions by the Trump administration. However, Cox Automotive expects that 2025 will set another record for EV sales, with EVs accounting for about 10% of new vehicle sales. Including hybrids, Cox Automotive expects one out of every four vehicles sold to be electrified in 2025..To compile our list of the 15 best EV stocks to buy according to billionaires, we looked for the biggest EV companies. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, ETFs, and various online resources to compile a list of the best EV stocks. Next, we focused on the top 10 EV stocks most favored by billionaires. Data for the number of billionaire investors for each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. Finally, the 15 best EV stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaires holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024..Additionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds..Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-best-ev-194527647.html

He slashed his price target on Tesla to $225 from $259..The consensus price target on the Street is $239, according to Yahoo Finance data..The stock tanked 8% to $242 in early trading alongside a broader hit to markets due to tariff concerns..""While the long-term story at Tesla has shifted to AI (robo-taxis and humanoid robots) and progress there continues, we believe these are longer dated opportunities that the premium multiple already (more than) considers.

The figure marked an 11.16% drop year over year and 20% decline from January..At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 72% year over year in February..In the US, prices on used Cybertrucks, Model 3s, Model Ss, Model Ys, and Model Xs continue to drop.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other auto stocks. Auto Sector Outlook 2025 On December 20, 2024, S&P Global released its auto sales forecast for 2025. The report […]","We recently compiled a list of the 8 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other auto stocks..On December 20, 2024, S&P Global released its auto sales forecast for 2025. The report forecasts a slight decrease in global light vehicle production for 2025, estimating a 0.4% decline to 88.7 million units. Moreover, the production is also expected to fall slightly by 1.6%, with production levels finishing at 89.1 million units. The report predicts this decline to be across all regions except mainland China and South America. The primary factor influencing the 2025 outlook is the anticipated implementation of a widespread tariff regime by the incoming US administration, which includes a universal 10% tariff on all goods entering the US and a 30% tariff on goods from mainland China. You can read more about it in our article titled, 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now..While elaborating on the expectations from a regional point of view, the report highlights stable production levels in Mainland China for 2025. The production level is anticipated to rise slightly by 0.1% to 29.6 million units. This will be driven by strong domestic demand for New Energy Vehicles and robust exports, though tempered by EU import tariffs on Chinese-made BEVs. On the other hand, in North America, the overall production is set to decrease by 2.4% to 15.1 million units. The report highlights that the US administration's policies are expected to influence overall demand and challenge vehicle mix assumptions. Deregulation could provide tailwinds for the North American auto industry later in the administration's second term..Production in Europe is expected to reach 16.6 million units in 2025, a 2.6% decrease from the estimated 17.0 million in 2024. This reflects adjustments in the propulsion mix in preparation for the 2025 EU emissions rules, along with new tariffs associated with the Trump administration, which particularly impacts premium vehicles..Despite concerns around electrification, the report expects electric vehicles to remain a significant growth sector. Global sales for battery electric passenger vehicles are projected to reach 15.1 million units in 2025, indicating a 30% increase compared to 2024 and accounting for an estimated 16.7% of global light vehicle sales. Moreover, in 2024 an estimated 11.6 million BEVs were sold globally, representing a 13.2% market share..To compile the list of 8 fastest growing auto stocks to invest in now, we used the year-over-year sales growth and 3-year sales growth as our primary indicators. Using the Finviz stock screener, we looked for auto manufacturers, auto parts, and auto and truck dealership companies that have a year-over-year sales growth of more than 15%, followed by a positive 3-year sales growth.

2025-03-02 20:47:00,"Nio Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",The Chinese EV maker looks like an undervalued growth stock.,"Nio (NYSE: NIO) was one of the market's hottest electric vehicle (EV) stocks just over four years ago. The Chinese EV maker's stock closed at its record high of $62.84 on Feb. 9, 2021, marking a 10-fold gain from its IPO price of $6.26 on Sept. 12, 2018..At the time, Nio's investors were dazzled by its soaring deliveries, its unique battery-swapping vehicles, and the expansion of its battery-swapping network. The buying frenzy in meme and growth stocks amplified those gains..But today, Nio's stock trades at about $5. It lost its luster as its deliveries slowed down, its vehicle margins declined, and it racked up steep losses. Rising interest rates squeezed its valuations, while the geopolitical and trade tensions between the U.S. and China further drove investors away from Chinese growth stocks. So is it the right time to buy, sell, or hold Nio's stock?.Nio sells electric sedans and SUVs, but its vehicles use swappable batteries instead of traditional chargers. For a fee, its batteries can be swapped out at its own swapping stations as a faster alternative to EV charging stalls..Nio delivered its first vehicles in 2018, and its deliveries soared through 2021. But in 2022 and 2023, its deliveries slowed down as it grappled with supply chain constraints, adverse weather conditions, China's economic slowdown, and tougher competition..Metric.2019.2020.2021.2022.2023.2024.Deliveries.20,565.43,728.91,429.122,486.160,038.221,970.Growth.81%.113%.109%.34%.31%.39%.Data source: Nio..In 2024, Nio's deliveries accelerated again as it sold more ET-series sedans and Onvo smart vehicles in China. It continued to expand in Europe, even though higher tariffs on Chinese EVs are making it tougher to undercut its overseas competitors..Nio's vehicle margins, which had plummeted from a record high of 20.2% in 2021 to 9.5% in 2023, also stabilized in 2024. That metric rose sequentially from 9.2% in the first quarter to 12.2% in the second quarter, then grew to 13.1% in the third quarter. Nio won't report its fourth-quarter earnings until early March, but it expects its vehicle margin to rise to 15% during the quarter, as it sold a higher mix of premium vehicles -- and that figure would represent its ""baseline"" vehicle margin in 2025. That confident outlook counters the bearish notion that it will lose its pricing power in China's crowded EV market..Nio expects its near-term growth to be driven by its market share gains in the EV market, its robust sales of higher-end vehicles like its ET7 Executive Edition sedan, and rising sales of its cheaper Onvo smart vehicles and new Firefly compact EV in China.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-stock-buy-sell-hold-124700983.html

(NIO) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by 1Darkhaos. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on NIO. NIO Inc. (NIO)'s share was trading at $4.72 as of Feb 26th..An assembly line of electric cars moving along a production line..NIO, the Chinese premium EV brand, presents a compelling investment opportunity despite skepticism around Chinese stocks. The company is expanding its addressable market with two new brands: FIREFLY, targeting low-end consumers, and ON V0, aimed at the middle-class segment. ON V0 is particularly significant, as its L60 model and future offerings are priced for mass-market adoption, making NIO more competitive. A crucial differentiator is NIO’s battery-swapping technology, allowing users to swap batteries in five minutes—a feature unmatched in the industry. Tesla abandoned battery swapping due to infrastructure challenges, but NIO has successfully implemented the system, completing one million swaps in just two weeks during Chinese New Year. Additionally, NIO operates the most extensive charging station network in China, with its Shanghai charging and swapping operations nearing profitability. Many EV brands use these stations, further strengthening NIO’s infrastructure advantage..Despite NIO’s current sales lagging behind competitors, its valuation is attractive compared to other EV brands. Investor sentiment toward Chinese equities may shift as U.S. political uncertainty increases, and China actively supports its tech sector. NIO’s CEO has set a target for profitability by the last quarter of 2025, which would mark a major turning point for the company. Furthermore, NIO benefits from strong financial backing, including the Chinese government, Tencent, and Abu Dhabi’s CYVN Holdings, reducing the risk of bankruptcy to nearly zero..Challenges remain, particularly in sales volume and competition within China’s crowded EV market. However, if NIO successfully penetrates the mass market with its battery-swapping advantage, the upside could be substantial. International sales remain low, but the company is expanding into Europe and planning entry into the Middle East, limiting its exposure to potential tariffs. While NIO is still burning cash, its profitability goal for 2025 adds confidence in its long-term outlook..While other Chinese EV stocks like Xpeng and Li Auto have already surged, NIO remains undervalued despite having a strong product lineup. Its vehicles are exceptional, and outdated reviews fail to capture their advancements. With a highly favorable risk/reward setup, investors could see significant returns. Even in a downside scenario, the potential loss is limited compared to the massive upside if NIO’s expansion strategy succeeds. The investment case is straightforward—NIO is at an inflection point, and for those willing to take the bet, the payoff could be substantial.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-bull-case-145453610.html

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other most oversold EV stocks to buy according to analysts..As per PwC, the race for EV adoption has been heating up, thanks to the tailwinds such as consumer interest, robust buy-in by automakers, and accelerated government funding. The electric transportation saw strong support from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – which finances $7.5 billion in EV charging infrastructure. Furthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act offered tax credits for new and used electric passenger and commercial vehicles..As per Research and Markets, the EV market is anticipated to reach US$1.58 trillion in 2033 from US$600.13 billion in 2024. The growth is expected to be aided by increased public awareness, the requirement for reducing emissions, developments around battery technology, supportive government policies and incentives, and strong investments in renewable energy sources..Governments and consumers continue to adopt EVs as a cleaner alternative to conventional ICE vehicles because of elevated concerns regarding environmental sustainability and the requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to Research and Markets. Additionally, improvements in the electric car range, together with charging infrastructure due to battery technological developments, have been fueling industry expansion..READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In..As per Dentons, the Polycentric Law Firm, emerging markets (EMs) continue to be central to global EV adoption, courtesy of increased urbanization, government incentives, and economic growth. Notably, the investments in EV infrastructure and battery technology have been fueling wider adoption. Furthermore, local manufacturing and innovation, including cost-effective EVs and off-grid charging stations, have been bolstering economic development in local EV industries of EMs..The flexible manufacturing platforms continue to support OEMs in adapting more efficiently to fluctuating market dynamics, like regulatory changes and changes in consumer preferences. Dentons believes that alliances with Chinese EV makers are expected to allow legacy OEMs to use advanced EV technologies, cost-efficient production methods, and well-established supply chains provided by Chinese OEMs. This can help facilitate the transition of legacy OEMs to electrification. Overall, 2025 might need flexibility, innovation, and adaptation in the broader automotive industry amidst economic pressures and evolving consumer expectations.

The firm’s delivery figures have improved notably over the past 12 months, but this is becoming an incredibly competitive industry. Even the dominant manufacturers are experiencing sales or margin pressures, which is core to my bearishness. NIO would need to massively outperform to become sustainable.

The firm’s delivery figures have improved notably over the past 12 months, but this is becoming an incredibly competitive industry. Even the dominant manufacturers are experiencing sales or margin pressures, which is core to my bearishness. NIO would need to massively outperform to become sustainable. Moreover, NIO’s cash burn has forced heavy reliance on external financing, with billions raised in share dilutive convertible notes and equity offerings..See what stocks are receiving Strong Buy ratings from top-rated analysts..Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with  TipRanks’ Stock Screener..NIO’s recent delivery growth shows signs of catching up to industry peers. The company reported 13,863 vehicle deliveries in January 2025 – a 38% year-over-year increase – split between its premium NIO brand and mass-market Onvo line. This dual-brand strategy appears pivotal, with Onvo accounting for 43% of January deliveries. The upcoming Firefly subcompact brand, launching in April 2025 with a $21,300 entry price, has exceeded order expectations and could add 50,000 annual deliveries..Cumulative deliveries reached 685,427 vehicles through January 2025, demonstrating some scaling progress. However, NIO continues to trail market leaders BYD (BYDDF) and Tesla (TSLA), each delivering over 1.5 million vehicles annually—partly due to pandemic-era hangovers..January’s results suggest improved execution. The company must maintain momentum through Firefly’s launch and Onvo’s production stabilization to close the gap with competitors, which may prove very difficult..Despite the improving deliveries, NIO’s financial position remains precarious, with no clear path to profitability. This is a core part of my bear case. The company reported a $710 million net loss in Q3 2024, up marginally year over year, while revenue actually fell. Full-year 2023 losses hit $2.9 billion despite 47% revenue growth..While gross margins improved from 8% to 10.7% between Q3 2023 and 2024, this trailed Tesla’s 17.6% and BYD’s 18.1%. The capital-intensive battery-swap network—now exceeding 2,300 stations—continues draining resources without demonstrating a clear competitive advantage over Tesla’s Supercharger network..NIO’s cash burn forced heavy reliance on external financing, with $2.6 billion raised in 2023 through convertible notes and equity offerings. Management’s 2025 target of 440,000 deliveries would require doubling the 2024 volume, demanding perfect execution of Firefly’s European expansion while navigating protectionist tariffs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-maker-nio-struggles-deliver-135213453.html

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other low price high volume stocks to buy now..Cheap stocks or stocks typically priced under $10, can be attractive for investors looking to make quick gains in shares. With a limited amount of investment, a larger number of shares can be acquired which provides greater potential for gains in case the stock prices rise. Investing in low-price stocks can be tempting but might not always be the best approach with more of these stocks being high risk with greater quality concerns. While investors can enjoy greater liquidity of their funds, these low-priced stocks can be glaring signs of underlying threats in the company’s outlook..In the fluctuating world of stock trading, especially with the volatile markets in the current scenario, low-priced high volume stocks can present unique opportunities for investors. While the cheap price offers growth potential and scope for appreciation, high trading volumes indicate market interest. These stocks are typically associated with small-cap or micro-cap companies and have garnered attention within the investing community, especially among retail investors seeking high-growth opportunities. They are known for their high volatility and liquidity. Low-priced stocks that trade at high volume, can mitigate some of the risks since they enable investors to enter and exit with ease and capitalize on short-term opportunities. The affordability of these stocks allows investors to diversify their portfolios making them accessible to a broader range of market participants. The less efficient market for low-priced stocks provides opportunities to identify undervalued companies before they gain broader recognition. Additionally, high trading volume indicates strong investor interest, driving price momentum and leading to substantial returns..A lot of these stocks typically operate in sectors with high interest such as renewable energy, clean-tech, and biotechnology that allows investors to tap into the market momentum of these sectors. In 2023, 60% of the stocks under $5 were operating in these sectors. Some of these sectors have seen unexpected developments in recent times due to changing investor preferences, regulations, and market innovations. Sectors like clean energy and biotechnology have seen some interesting developments driven by technological advancements and regulatory push. While the clean-tech companies have benefited from market incentives, biotech firms have experienced breakthroughs in healthcare innovation and drug developments. These developments have been beneficial for small players in the industry, but the market is still fraught with risks for low-priced stocks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-low-price-142101878.html

Sales forecasts expect a continued increase in BEV market share, with an evolution in consumer demand and infrastructure. In October 2024, the BEV market touched an 8.9% share of all retail registrations, demonstrating a YoY increase of only 0.6 percentage points..S&P Global further added that through the first 10 months of 2024, BEV sales volume saw a strong growth of 12.6% from the previous year, registering 1,023,716 units..Rho Motion, the leading EV research house, announced that the number of EVs sold globally in January 2025 stood at 1.3 million. While it fell by over a third from December’s strong month, the global market saw an increase of 18% as compared to January 2024.

2025-02-18 17:11:00,ZF supplies latest steer-by-wire to Nio,Latest generation SBW to feature in Nio ET9 flagship.,"ZF Group announced this week it has begun series production of its latest-generation steer-by-wire system for Chinese battery electric vehicle (BEV) manufacturer Nio Inc’s flagship ET9 model..The German components manufacturer is a leading developer and manufacturer of drive-by-wire systems, including braking and steering systems that do not use direct mechanical or fluid-based connections. The company’s portfolio of purely electronically controlled steering and braking systems, and controlled damping systems, combined with its in-house cubiX software, form the basis of software-defined vehicles..ZF claims to have a significant share of the growing “by-wire” segment, with sales now driven by the company’s new Chassis Solutions Division which was established at the beginning of 2024..ZF's steer-by-wire steering system does not use a mechanical connection between the steering wheel and steering gear. Instead, it uses as a mechatronic actuator as the only source of steering power, with steering commands issued by a steering wheel actuator in the cockpit based on the angle of the rotation sensor. An electric drive, or torque feedback unit, reproduces the natural steering feel and feedback from the road..Dr Peter Holdmann, a member of ZF’s Board of Management and head of the Chassis Solutions Division, said in a statement: ""We are supplying customers with the steering of the future. With our production-ready steer-by-wire steering system, we are launching the era of the software-defined vehicle. With an entire portfolio of innovative by-wire technologies, we are a sought-after supplier and a key driver of future-oriented chassis technologies. ZF is thus establishing itself as a technology leader in this area and giving car manufacturers such as Nio new freedom in terms of design, comfort, driving functions and safety.”.Danilo Teobaldi, Principal Chief Engineer at Nio, said: “At Nio we are committed to delivering groundbreaking innovations that redefine premium driving experience. Steer-by-wire technology is a key enabler of software-defined vehicles, offering enhanced driving comfort, uncompromised dynamics, and future-proof technology.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best Robinhood stocks to buy under $20.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against other best Robinhood stocks to buy under $20..Stocks priced under $20 have become an attractive option for investors looking to tap into growth without paying the high premiums of blue-chip stocks. These companies often operate in innovative sectors—like quantum computing, autonomous delivery, and clean energy—where technological advancements could lead to significant returns. However, these stocks also come with risks, such as volatility and speculative trading, making it important to separate hype from long-term potential..Retail trading platforms like Robinhood have made these stocks more accessible, allowing retail investors to drive market movements. In 2023, retail trading accounted for 23% of U.S. equity volumes, according to JPMorgan. This shift has altered the landscape of stock investing, with retail investors now playing a significant role in driving the prices of low-priced stocks. Robinhood, with its commission-free structure and easy-to-use app, has attracted millions of new investors eager to participate in the stock market, often gravitating toward the affordability of stocks under $20..Low-priced stocks are appealing for a few key reasons. The affordability of these stocks means that investors can diversify their portfolios more easily, mitigating risk by spreading investments across various companies or sectors. For new or retail investors, low-priced stocks can provide an accessible entry point into the market. With a smaller initial investment, it’s easier to dip your toes into stock investing without committing large amounts of capital..Low-priced stocks often represent companies in the early stages of growth or in industries that are still developing. These stocks may have greater potential for significant price appreciation, particularly if the company experiences a breakthrough. Investors who get in early can sometimes ride the wave of exponential growth. For example, in 2010, Tesla’s IPO price was $17 per share, and for several years, it traded below $20. By 2021, however, the company’s stock price surged to over $1,000 per share, reflecting the company’s transition from an early-stage electric vehicle startup to a global leader in the industry..However, these stocks also come with risks, such as volatility and speculative trading, making it important to separate hype from long-term potential. According to Saxo Bank, small-cap stocks—often found in the under-$20 price range—tend to be more sensitive to market fluctuations and economic shifts, which can lead to higher volatility and greater price swings.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-one-best-182527228.html

(NIO): Among the Best Automotive Stocks to Invest In According to Analysts,"We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Automotive Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts.

(NYSE:NIO) stands against the other automotive stocks..The automotive sector is navigating a complex and uncertain landscape, shaped by economic volatility, regulatory shifts, and evolving consumer demand. One of the biggest concerns recently has been the proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, which triggered a strong response from MEMA, a leading vehicle suppliers trade association. MEMA warned that such tariffs could jeopardize thousands of American jobs, raise costs for consumers, and disrupt the highly integrated North American supply chain, which is essential to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the global auto market. While a temporary agreement to delay these tariffs provides some relief, uncertainty remains, especially as new challenges emerge, including the halt in funding for the U.S. National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. This funding pause could slow the country’s transition to EVs by limiting the expansion of charging networks and reducing incentives for adoption..Fitch Ratings, in a report published in December, assigned a ‘neutral’ outlook to the industry, expecting 2% growth in global light vehicle sales. Pricing pressure is likely to rise as competition in the EV segment intensifies, while inflation may shift consumer preferences toward more affordable vehicles. That said, they expect interest rate cuts could support stronger vehicle demand, and automakers’ strategic diversification into EVs, autonomous tech, and digital mobility solutions remains a key growth driver..Despite the headwinds, the automotive industry remains on a path of steady growth. MarketsandMarkets’ ‘Global Automotive Outlook-2025’ projects global light vehicle sales to grow 1.3% in 2025, reaching 85.1 million units. This growth will be fuelled by rising EV and hybrid adoption, advancements in battery technology, and the expansion of autonomous and connected vehicle initiatives. Automakers are also pushing for wider commercialization of self-driving technology, 5G connectivity in vehicles, and digital car sales platforms, shaping the industry’s future. The report further elaborates that China continues to dominate the global automotive market, accounting for over 26 million light vehicle sales in 2024, nearly 50% of the global total. The country also leads EV battery production, manufacturing over 50% of the world’s EV batteries and controlling 75% of key battery components. With a growing number of high-net-worth individuals in Asia-Pacific, the region is expected to drive market expansion in 2025, particularly in premium and EV segments.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-among-best-215749022.html

And now, one Wall Street analyst has cut his firm's price target on the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker by one-third..J.P. Morgan's Nick Lai has suggested owners of U.S.-listed Nio shares continue to hold them but doesn't recommend buying more right now. He has slashed his price target on the shares from $7 to $4.70, according to reports..The new target price still represents about 10% more upside from recent levels, but Lai doesn't think the business is growing the way it should. Investors seem to agree: The stock has dropped more than 20% over the last year..Lai's issue with Nio is where its sales are coming from. Its 2024 vehicle deliveries rose nearly 40% versus 2023, but its newest EVs are high-end luxury cars like its ET9 executive sedan. With a list price starting at about $100,000, that type of EV has a limited market..Nio launched a lower-priced brand called Onvo last year, but sales of that family-focused, smart EV only represented about one-third of deliveries in December and January. The company is working to grow its mass market appeal, though..A new budget brand called Firefly is a compact hatchback EV. The official launch is expected in April. It may still be early to buy Nio stock, but investors with a long-term view could see benefits starting to come from its lower-priced brands in the next year.

Lithium is a soft, silver-white alkali metal that has become a cornerstone of the clean revolution. Its commonly […]","We recently compiled a list of the 12 Biggest Lithium Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other lithium stocks..Lithium is a soft, silver-white alkali metal that has become a cornerstone of the clean revolution. Its commonly used form, lithium carbonate, is required for the production of lithium-ion batteries. These power a variety of technologies, including vast renewable energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EV), making them nearly indispensable in the development of sustainable energy solutions. Although EVs have been available for a while, it wasn't until recent technology breakthroughs and cost reductions that they became a more reliable option for consumers, resulting in an increase in lithium demand. The International Energy Agency states that the demand for lithium will climb by over 40 times between 2020 and 2040, particularly for use in battery storage and electric cars. As per Fortune Business Insights, the global lithium market achieved a valuation of $22.19 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $134.02 billion by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 22.1%..According to a McKinsey report, the global drive to net-zero will depend on guaranteeing a consistent supply of essential battery raw materials, especially as demand for EVs climbs toward the latter of this decade. Based on the report, the global market for BEV passenger cars is expected to increase sixfold between 2021 and 2030, with yearly sales rising from 4.5 million to almost 28 million units during that time. In addition, such a forecast indicates that the sector is ""likely to confront persistent long-term challenges"" in line with demand. McKinsey also states that 80% of all lithium mined now is used by battery manufacturers, and by 2030, that number may rise to 95%..On the other hand, analysts predict increased volatility in lithium carbonate in 2024, following a challenging year in which the metal's price plunged 22% due to a global supply glut. However, some balance is expected to recover. S&P Global predicts that as production cuts begin to reduce excess supply, lithium surplus would fall to 33,000 metric tons in 2025 from 84,000 metric tons in 2024. According to Chris Berry, president of House Mountain Partners, however, the behavior of the lithium price over the next year may be unpredictable. He said the following:.“Lithium price volatility is a feature of the energy transition and not a bug. You have a small but fast-growing market, opaque pricing, legislation designed to rapidly build critical infrastructure underpinned by lithium and other metals, and this is a recipe for boom-and-bust cycles demonstrated by extremely high and extremely low pricing.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-nio-biggest-lithium-142811313.html

Here's why.,"General Motors' (GM) hot stock has sprung a leak after its latest earnings report on Tuesday..Shares of the auto giant fell as much as 11% on Tuesday and closed down 9%. It marked the worst day for the stock since March 2020. The stock shed another 1% through midday trading on Wednesday..The stock had gained 50% in 2024 as GM moved quickly to slash billions in costs and repurchase stock. Results also consistently beat analyst estimates..""Stock got hit hard on [Tuesday] for various reasons, but lack of new share buyback announcement loomed large,"" explained BofA auto analyst John Murphy in a note to clients Wednesday..GM repurchased more than $7 billion in stock in 2024 and more than $11 billion in 2023. Repurchases have played a key role in boosting GM's profits by reducing shares outstanding and, by extension, supporting a higher stock price..While Murphy believes the harsh market reaction was overdone, he listed a host of reasons why GM's stock could stay in the penalty box for the near term..""We heard a number of factors that appear to have unnerved the market: 1) Policy uncertainty with no change encompassed in the outlook — tariffs, IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] incentives, EPA/CARB ACC II; 2) Negative mix in the fourth quarter and concerns this will hit hard with more EVs in 2025, 3) Concern of price declines greater than outlook of -1% to -1.5%, 4) Flat volume outlook is disappointing; and 5) Lack of new buyback authorization (likely to be announced soon)."".Tariffs in particular hang over auto sector stocks and their valuations..The auto industry is responsible for 26% of imports from Mexico to the US and 12% from Canada, UBS researchers estimated..GM produces highly profitable pickup trucks in Mexico and relies on the country to make EVs such as the Chevy Blazer and Cadillac Optiq.

There are plenty of options in the blossoming electric vehicle (EV) industry as the globe transitions from internal combustion engines (ICE) to EVs..QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) can improve EV batteries in just about every way possible if it finishes developing its solid-state battery technology. And Nio (NYSE: NIO), a leading premium Chinese EV maker, has positioned itself for massive top-line growth in 2025. Both could see their stock prices jump in the year ahead..QuantumScape has always been one of the most intriguing EV investments. If achieved, the company's solid-state battery technology would increase driving range, lessen charging time, improve safety, and lower costs -- a perfect storm of factors. The problem is that it's a big ""if,"" because nobody has accomplished what QuantumScape is attempting..The good news is that so far the process is going well, and the company has already unveiled its sample product using the Raptor process. Now, the company has announced that next-generation equipment for the next phase of development -- code-named Cobra -- has been delivered, developed, installed, and released for initial separator processing..All that is a fancy way to say that QuantumScape is on track to deliver higher-volume samples for its first planned commercial product in 2025. This would be a major step toward the commercialization of its solid-state batteries for EVs, and a major factor in convincing investors there's a real future for its technology..QuantumScape already has the next leg of the race covered with its agreement with PowerCo, the battery manufacturing subsidiary of Volkswagen Group. Upon satisfactory technical progress, PowerCo receives a license to mass-produce battery cells based on QuantumScape's technology in exchange for royalties, including a $130 million prepayment..If the company executes and delivers higher-volume samples with its Cobra process in 2025, expect the company's stock to jump higher as it inches closer to commercial volume production -- that's when the stock can really reward investors..Nio investors had a lot to catch up on at the end of 2024 with the company's ""Nio Day"" at the end of December. While the company did have fairly lofty growth expectations at the beginning of its story, the company has largely disappointed with its delivery and top-line growth. But that's about to be a narrative of the past, as Nio prepares to ride its two new brands to serious top-line growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ev-stocks-soar-2025-150000917.html
