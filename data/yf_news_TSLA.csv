TD Cowen equity analyst Itay Michaeli says there were two aspects to the launch that went better than expected. Find out what they are in the video above..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here..Day one does seem like it was successful. There were two aspects of the launch that were better than what we would have expected coming in. The first is where the vehicles actually operated or the operational design domain was larger than what we would have expected and some of the pick up and drop off activity looked pretty impressive for a first day in a robotaxi operation. While it's still premature to draw meaningful big picture conclusions from a single day, but so far a pretty impressive launch and we'll kind of have to monitor it in the weeks and months ahead. .How how quickly and aggressively do you think Musk can expand this service across the country? .I think their strategy of a measured approach is the right one. Safety is paramount. We've seen situations in the past where robo taxi networks had safety issues and some of them actually shut down as a result of it. It's we want to first and foremost monitor the safety record, rider and stakeholder feedback in the weeks and months ahead. Does the operational design domain expand from where they are currently? Does the fleet size expand from here? But going at it slow, particularly given Tesla's lead relative to other car companies in the autonomous vehicle space, does give them some breathing room to move slowly. And so execution around that is key. I think if all goes well, probably in the next few months, investors will be asking what the next city could be. And for us, we're also really watching what ends up happening to the consumer fleet. Whether maybe an overlooked opportunity frankly in the Tesla autonomous vehicle story to, you know, roll out eyes off FSD features that could both complement the robo taxi fleet and lead to new services and features for consumers that can drive up not only new revenue streams for Tesla, but also vehicle demand itself. .In this space Musk has plenty of competition. He's got Waymo and Amazon Zoox is in there, and when your clients are asking you what what you think his competitive advantages are, what do you tell them? .Sure. Cost is one of them. Speed is another and the talent they have at Tesla. This is a 1 and a half trillion dollar mobility market in the US. The ride share industry today is only about $60 billion. So we still have a lot more to go. We think Tesla's competitive advantage could really allow them to deploy AVs, both robo taxis and consumer AV features in less dense MSAs, where today the ride share market is not particularly highly penetrated, and because of Tesla's cost advantage because of things like shadow mode validation that they can use from their existing fleet. We think they have an opportunity to launch robo taxis in markets are today less penetrated and complement those with consumer vehicles, and also, of course, lead to new features and services as well. Think of the vehicle getting your deliveries in the middle of the night. Think of dropping you off at the movie theater and picking you up later on. Features that you could charge for and of course, could create an unprecedented proposition for consumer demand across Tesla's vehicles. We know, of course, demand has been more challenging recent quarters. So we look at the AV story is very complementary to the overall EV story and demand story at Tesla, but cost and speed really are key advantages they have today.

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman chat with Washington Crossing Advisors senior portfolio manager Chad Morganlander and Innovator ETFs chief investment strategist Tim Urbanowicz about the event and what it means for Tesla investors..To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here..All right, now let's turn to my stock of the day. That is drum roll please, Tesla. The company rolled out its much anticipated robotaxi in Austin over the weekend, but only for a select few passengers, a who's who of Tesla influencers. Of course, the taxis drove in a small portion of the Texas city with a Tesla employee in the front seat for safety. Jumping into the Yahoo Finance platform, you can see this hype test comes during a lot of hope for Tesla's earnings potential. Uh the company has a trailing price to earnings multiple of 184 times. You're actually seeing that correctly, guys, and a forward PE of 166 times. For perspective, the S&P 500 is only at 21 times. Still with me is my round table of pros, Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, Tim Urbanowitz, chief investment strategist at Innovator ETFs, and of course, Yahoo Finance's very own Julie Hyman. Julie, I know you're a big Tesla fan. So I think you're going to set the tone for this one. Robo taxis floating around streets, driving by themselves in Austin. I'm trying to figure out when this actually starts making money for Tesla because you saw the PE multiples I just mentioned here at the top. This stock continues to be priced for perfection at a time where earnings estimates for Tesla continue to tank. .Earnings, if you're a Tesla bull, you don't care about numbers, right? I mean, you care about vibes. You care about the future. You care about the trillion dollar autonomous opportunity that Dan Ives, whose pictures we're showing, um, is always talking about here and other bulls like Kathy Wood over at Arc. Um, but you really, you, um, sort of put, put your finger on it when you said it's sort of influencers who are invited to this thing. You know, Jordan Klein, who's a desk analyst over at Mizuho, in his morning note, he said, first of all, he said this seems like a yawn the whole event, but he said Tesla controlled the event and test a lot, hand-picking many of the test riders knowing they're are big, they are big Tesla supporters. Like what I, what I would like to see is someone who is not a huge Tesla bull getting one of these cars and give me a review. .Chad, I didn't see you out there in Tesla land driving these taxis around. I love what you said about your holding of Lockheed Martin at the top of the show, 15 times forward earnings. What do you think when you see Tesla getting driverless cars out there, but the forward PE is 166 times, has to drive you crazy, right? .Brian, there's a lot of jazz hands going on here. It's 10 times revenue. Uh you have a multiple that's insane. Um and then there's a, there's another company, a little company called Alphabet, which for full disclosure, I own in personally and Washington Crossing owns. And that's trading at 16 times next year multiple. And they have something called Waymo. So Waymo has been proven, it's working in many cities. And we believe that this whole robotaxi idea that you're going to let your car go out in the middle of the night and pick up drunk people, um, is perhaps, you know, just to make money is perhaps a little bit foolhardy. So we'd be more mindful about owning Tesla, we would pick Alphabet instead. .Chad, would you actually get in one of these to drive? Would you take a ride in this? .I would definitely take a, take a, take a ride in it. And and you know what, this technology is wonderful. Don't get me wrong. Um, this is perhaps going to work, but Waymo is going, is, is light years ahead of them. They're perhaps going to just sell their software package to other companies like General Motors, Toyota, and whatnot. And they're going to go the route of Microsoft when it comes to the software distribution. They have yet to announce that, but it's pretty obvious what, what their game plan is. .Tim, I know you're ditching all your cars and you're going to be a robotaxi fan. I just see, I get that vibe. You know, I just get that vibe. .Yeah, it's, it's an interesting one. I, I kind of see both sides here. I hope Julie doesn't kill me, but uh, you know, I'm kind of in the same boat there. You look at that multiple, it's hard to imagine them growing into that uh, in, in any short period of time. And Brian, as with anything that we've seen from Tesla, it always takes longer than Elon thinks and, and investors think. So we have to be uh, really conscious of that. But I do think the growth story or the, the innovation story is there, and that's going to drive hype, that's going to drive the stock price in the short term. A lot of what our clients are doing is using a risk manage approach to get exposure to stocks like Tesla and, and the Nasdaq 100 as a whole, with strategies like QFLR where they're putting a, a floor, a 10% floor against losses on their Nasdaq exposure, but they're still maintaining that upside. You know, if, if this hype continues to drive these stocks like Tesla higher, they're participating, but they also have that risk management in place. You know, with that multiple, that stock could fall pretty hard and other stocks there, there as well. So we, we think that's a prudent approach right now. .Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't get me wrong. I'd love to ride in one of these things, right? Or give like I'm psyched that Waymo is coming to New York City. Bring me the Tesla robotaxi, but you know, when you're coming out from an investment perspective, you have to separate what you think is cool and what you think is a good investment. .All right, let's leave the panel there. Julie Hyman, I'll see you back at your desk. Chad Morganlander, good to see you. Tim Urbanowitz, appreciate guys coming on.

2025-06-24 14:04:00,Analysis-Why Tesla's robotaxi launch was the easy part,"(Reuters) -Tesla finally has a robotaxi.  The electric-vehicle maker deployed its first-ever driverless cabs in Austin, Texas, on Sunday in a small-scale test of carefully monitored Model Y vehicles.  Next, the company faces the steep challenge of executing on CEO Elon Musk’s ambition to refine the software and upload it to millions of Teslas within a year or so.","By Rachael Levy, Norihiko Shirouzu and Abhirup Roy.(Reuters) -Tesla finally has a robotaxi. Now comes the hard part..The electric-vehicle maker deployed its first-ever driverless cabs in Austin, Texas, on Sunday in a small-scale test of carefully monitored Model Y vehicles. Next, the company faces the steep challenge of executing on CEO Elon Musk’s ambition to refine the software and upload it to millions of Teslas within a year or so..Such a rapid expansion will prove extremely difficult, about a dozen industry analysts and autonomous-vehicle technology experts told Reuters. These observers expressed a range of views about Tesla’s prospects but all cautioned against assuming a light-speed robotaxi rollout..Some pointed to advantages Tesla might exploit to overtake rivals including Alphabet’s Waymo and a host of Chinese auto and tech companies. Tesla has mass-manufacturing capacity, and it pioneered remote software updates it can use for self-driving upgrades. The automaker also does not use sensors such as radar and lidar like Waymo and most rivals; instead, it depends solely on cameras and artificial intelligence..“A rollout could be really quick. If the software works, Tesla robotaxi could drive any road in the world,” said Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, while cautioning that Tesla is still “testing the product.”.In Austin, Tesla launched a choreographed experiment involving maybe a dozen cars, operating in limited geography, with safety monitors in the front passenger seat; remote “teleoperators”; plans to avoid bad weather; and hand-picked pro-Tesla influencers as passengers..For years, Musk has said Tesla would soon operate its own autonomous ride-hailing service and also turn any Tesla, new or used, into a cash-generating robotaxi for its customers. That will be “orders of magnitude” more difficult than testing in Austin, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor focused on autonomous-driving regulation..“It’s like announcing that, ‘I’m going to Mars’ and then, you know, going to Cleveland,” Smith said..Musk has said Tesla will reach Mars, in that metaphor, quite quickly: ""I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,"" he said in April..Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla shares ended 8.2% higher at $348.68 on Monday on investor enthusiasm over the robotaxi launch..Given Tesla’s AI-dependent approach, its challenge will be machine-training robotaxis to handle complex traffic “edge cases,” said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert. That could take many years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-why-teslas-robotaxi-launch-060400479.html

Tesla bulls, such as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, have pointed out that Tesla's robotaxis and self-driving software have the potential to double the automaker’s market capitalization by the end of 2026..Tesla shares jumped more than 8% on Monday to around $349. The stock is still down about 14% since the start of the year, but it's risen more than 60% from its early-April low, boosted in part by Musk's decision to relinquish his role heading the Department of Government Efficiency and spend more time at his companies, including Tesla..Below, we take a closer look at Tesla’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching..After a pullback to the 50- and 200-day moving averages, Tesla shares consolidated within a pennant pattern just above the closely watched indicators..More recently, the stock broke out from the pennant on above-average volume in Monday’s trading session, setting the stage for a new leg higher. The move also coincided with a strong uptick in the relative strength index, indicating accelerating price momentum..Let’s identify three key overhead areas on Tesla’s chart to watch if the shares continue to rally and also locate an important support level worth monitoring..The first overhead area to watch sits around $365. This area, just 5% above Monday’s closing price, could provide resistance near last month’s prominent peak, which also aligns with the February countertrend high and twin peaks that formed on the chart last November..A convincing close above this area could trigger a rally toward $430. The shares may face selling pressure in this location near a series of trading activity situated just below the stock’s record high set in mid-December last year. Interestingly, this area also sits in the same neighborhood as a projected upside target that takes Tesla’s price action from late April to late May and repositions it from this month’s pullback low.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-tesla-levels-stock-soars-022352726.html
2025-06-24 08:30:00,Tesla Just Achieved a Big Milestone With Its Robotaxi Launch. But There's Another Potential Speed Bump Fast Approaching.,"With its official soft launch of robotaxis on June 22, Tesla achieved a goal that it has been working toward for years.  Investors are betting big on Tesla's future robotaxi fleet.  Investors are concerned about the company's second-quarter EV sales, which it will reveal in a couple of weeks.","With its official soft launch of robotaxis on June 22, Tesla achieved a goal that it has been working toward for years..Investors are betting big on Tesla's future robotaxi fleet..Investors are concerned about the company's second-quarter EV sales, which it will reveal in a couple of weeks..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and its CEO Elon Musk recently achieved a big milestone -- they launched the company's first self-driving robotaxis for paying customers in Austin, Texas. It's an initiative that Musk first discussed in 2016. While it looks more like a soft launch, it's still a big step for Tesla, which plans to launch a fully autonomous robotaxi fleet. Many investors think that could be a massive new business for the company that will justify Tesla's monster valuation..Still, Tesla has a lot going on right now. Remember, the company's core business is still electric vehicles (EVs), and that business is facing a critical event in just a few weeks' time..Tesla is expected to announce its second-quarter EV delivery figures in the first week of July. As many investors likely recall, first-quarter deliveries came in at roughly 337,000, its lowest quarterly number in over two years. Many investors have been concerned that Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump and his period of leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have alienated a significant portion of Tesla's potential customer base..While Musk has stepped down from his work with DOGE to refocus on his businesses, data thus far on Tesla's sales in the second quarter has been less than encouraging. Monthly sales data from Europe showed that Tesla's sales once again faltered in April in countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, and France..Other data suggests that its sales in China have struggled in the second quarter as well. Aside from politics and brand image, Tesla may also be struggling there as a result of increasing competition from competitors like BYD, which has grabbed a dominant market share in China. BYD's EVs are cheaper and its newest tech can charge faster than Tesla's. These factors, in my opinion, will pose a bigger problem for Tesla than its brand or political issues, which are likely to fade over time..Wall Street analysts are modeling for second-quarter deliveries of roughly 400,000, which would be an improvement from the first quarter, but a 10% year-over-year decline. However, some analysts don't expect investors to care much if Tesla misses estimates.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-just-achieved-big-milestone-003000555.html

Tesla stock  (TSLA)  surged roughly 8.2% on June 23 following its Robotaxi launch during the weekend..The electric vehicle maker on Sunday deployed a small group of self-driving taxis picking up paying passengers in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk called the event the “culmination of a decade of hard work” in a post on X, noting that “the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla.”.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives attended the Robotaxi event and said he was ""very impressed."".💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵.“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” he described..“The interior features two touchscreen panels: one in the front and one in the back row above the AC vent. The back row panel is able to integrate with the user's Tesla account and sync with their Robotaxi app and automatically loads the user's content onto a suite of apps including Apple Music, Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, Disney+, and more.”.The self-driving experience may feel futuristic, but the need to buckle up hasn’t changed. And the same goes for how investors view Tesla stock..Tesla is the world’s most valuable automaker, but its investors had a tough time earlier this year. EV sales slowed in key markets like Europe, China, and California, while Musk drew criticism for focusing more on politics than the company’s core business..In April, Tesla reported weak earnings earlier this week, including a 20% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue and a 71% plunge in net income..Related: Tesla’s robotaxi finally launches, but there’s a twist.Many Wall Street analysts now believe that much of Tesla's sky-high stock value rests on its ability to deliver robotaxis and humanoid robots. Musk said his goal is to expand the service to many U.S. cities by the end of this year, with “millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year.”.Still, the company could face major challenges in scaling up the Robotaxi service quickly..Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed legislation on June 20 requiring a state permit to operate self-driving vehicles, effective September 1. However, compliance in Texas remains far easier than in some states, notably California, which requires the submission of vehicle-testing data under state oversight, according to Reuters.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotaxi-news-sends-tesla-stock-000507141.html

Bloomberg was the first to report that the NHTSA reached out to Tesla. The NHTSA confirmed to TechCrunch that it has contacted the automaker..“NHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,” the company said in an emailed statement. “NHTSA will continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment, in accordance with the Vehicle Safety Act and our data-driven, risk-based investigative process.  Under U.S. law, NHTSA does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems — rather, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets NHTSA’s rigorous safety standards, and the agency investigates incidents involving potential safety defects. Following an assessment of those reports and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.”.On Sunday, Tesla began giving paid rides to invited customers in South Austin. The launch, while limited in size and scope, is the first real test of the automaker’s autonomous vehicle technology. Tesla does sell its branded Full Self-Driving Supervised software to owners of its vehicles. FSD handles steering and braking when engaged. However, it is considered an advanced driver-assistance system that requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel..Tesla robotaxis are equipped with an unsupervised version of FSD, although the company has not provided specific details about this software. The robotaxis, which customers can hail via an app, are meant to drive on their own. Notably, Tesla robotaxis have a human “safety monitor” sitting in the front passenger seat during these rides..Videos posted online show the Tesla robotaxis driving over the speed limit and in one case, swerving into the wrong lane..TechCrunch reported Sunday that Ed Niedermeyer, author of “Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors,” who is in Austin to monitor the robotaxi rollout, took video showing a Tesla branded robotaxi suddenly hitting its brakes on two occasions without reason. A video, which TechCrunch has viewed and has since been posted on YouTube, shows that in both instances the Tesla hit the brakes as it approached police vehicles that were located in parking lot driveways adjacent to the roadway.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxis-already-caught-attention-224439078.html

According to Ives, Tesla “remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” having the potential to roughly double its value by the end of next year. Ives is optimistic that the “golden era of autonomous for Tesla” officially begins with the launch of the roughly 20 Model Y robotaxis in a geofenced area around Austin. They “believe the march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with [Full Self-Driving] and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose.”.The company also plans to scale to around 25 cities in the US over the next few years. Deeming the launch as one of the most important chapters in Tesla’s history, the analysts are optimistic that the event is a “foundation of autonomous growth for years to come.”.“We believe the AI future at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is worth $1 trillion to the valuation alone over the next few years,” Wedbush wrote..The investor note also noted regulatory tailwinds under Trump presidency, anticipating that federal oversight will help simplify approval for full self-driving technologies..“Trump wants the U.S. to stay ahead of China in this AI Arms Race.”.Moreover, autonomous technology “is a key factor in who wins AI… with Tesla playing a major role on robotaxis.” Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives.

The Google parent's two publicly traded stocks ended the day around 1% lower in price, comparing unfavorably to the nearly 1% gain of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)..That rival is Alphabet's peer in the self-driving taxi space, Tesla. On Sunday, the high-profile auto company officially launched its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Although rides were limited to selected users, the event went off smoothly, without any reported accidents..While Alphabet's great strength and the source of its wealth is the advertising it sells for its omnipresent search engine, the company has been pushing into other cutting-edge tech ventures for much of its corporate life. One of the more prominent of these is its own autonomous taxi service, Waymo, which has been operational in a handful of U.S. cities for months, even years..With the launch of the Tesla service, Alphabet now has a competitor in the self-driving taxi space. Investors rarely like when one of their companies suddenly loses a big competitive advantage..Yet the reactive hit to Alphabet's stock was minimal, most likely because many investors realize that the self-driving taxi segment isn't (yet) large enough to seriously impact either their company or Tesla..On top of that, Tesla hasn't revealed when, where, or to what degree it'll expand its Austin Robotaxi rollout. This suggests that the company is being cautious -- as it should be -- about widening the service..So far, the auto-taxi space has been developing more smoothly than many expected; if it maintains the pace, such services will be commonplace before long. While Alphabet's Waymo now has competition (and more will surely come), it's not getting knocked off its perch as No. 1 in the near future..Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:.The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

NHTSA officials regularly interact with automakers on safety matters, and it’s common for those discussions to stop short of a formal investigation..“Following an assessment of those reports and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety,” the agency said on Monday..Tesla’s shares fell as much as 1.4% in postmarket trading after Bloomberg reported NHTSA’s discussions with the company. The stock was little changed at 5:33 p.m. in New York..In one video taken by investor Rob Maurer, who used to host a Tesla podcast, a Model Y he’s riding in enters an Austin intersection in a left-turn-only lane. The Tesla hesitates to make the turn, swerves right and proceeds into an unoccupied lane meant for traffic moving in the opposite direction..A honking horn can be heard as the Tesla re-enters the correct lane over a double-yellow line, which drivers aren’t supposed to cross..In two other posts on X, initial riders in driverless Model Ys shared footage of Teslas speeding. A vehicle carrying Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor, reached 35 miles per hour shortly after passing a 30 miles per hour speed limit sign, a video he posted shows..In a separate live stream from Herbert Ong, a YouTuber with more than 123,000 subscribers, he commented that the vehicle was going faster than the posted limit of 35 miles per hour..“It’s going at 39 right now, which is perfect, right, because I don’t want to drive at 35, and it’s driving at the same flow of traffic,” Ong said. “If everyone else is driving at this speed, you want to be at the same speed.”.Representatives for Tesla and the Austin Police Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the videos. The automaker recalled more than 362,000 vehicles in February 2023 after NHTSA said its driver-assistance system may allow cars to infringe on local traffic laws..A spokesman for the city of Austin said it hadn’t received any safety incident reports regarding Tesla’s robotaxis over the weekend.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-videos-show-speeding-161403957.html

The carmaker hand-picked a friendly group of retail investors and social-media influencers to serve as initial riders and live-stream their trips..In one video, Herbert Ong, who runs a fan account, marveled over the speed of the vehicle and its ability to park autonomously. Another influencer with the X handle @BLKMDL3 deemed his trip smoother than with a human driver. Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor who runs an account focused on the company, called the experience “awesome.”.With no kickoff event and little in the way of formal announcements, Tesla relied largely on word of mouth and media coverage ahead of the robotaxi launch. The unveiling was uncharacteristically low-key for a company that held a “Cyber Rodeo” to mark its Texas factory opening in 2022 and an invite-only party last year near Hollywood to unveil autonomous vehicle prototypes..While Musk has cautioned that autonomy is unlikely to “move the financial needle” at Tesla for at least another year, progress toward getting the service started has boosted the company’s shares. The stock jumped 8.2% — the biggest gain in two months — to close regular trading in New York on Monday at $348.68..Musk has been reorienting the carmaker around still-unproven technologies including self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots. Some investors are counting on new business segments to revive Tesla from a vehicle sales slump and consumer backlash against its chief executive officer. The company’s shares are still down 20% this year..“While Tesla appears to be well positioned, we believe the opportunity is already priced into the stock,” Joseph Spak, a UBS Group AG analyst with a sell rating on the shares, wrote in a report Monday. He raised his price target to $215, well short of its close at $322.16 last week..Explainer: Why Tesla’s Valuation Rests on Musk More Than Reality.Videos of the robotaxi launch posted Sunday were mostly mundane, showing Model Y SUVs driving short distances, navigating intersections, avoiding pedestrians and parking — all with no one sitting in the driver’s seat. The debut was “largely uneventful” and free of major missteps, with the start of revenue service marking a “critical milestone” for bulls in the stock, Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a note.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-starts-long-awaited-robotaxi-003252048.html

On June 17, it was reported that Tesla is implementing another production halt at its Gigafactory in Texas, which will affect the Model Y and Cybertruck production lines. This shutdown is slated to begin on June 30 and extend through the week of the July Fourth holiday. It will mark the second such pause at the facility in 2 months and the 3rd in the past year..The production halts come amid mounting pressure on Tesla due to slower demand and increasing inventory levels. Earlier in June this year, reports indicated that Tesla was renting overflow parking lots across the US to store unsold vehicles, which included Cybertrucks. Cybertruck production has already been scaled back in 2025, with sales tracking at about half of the previous year’s figures, despite the introduction of cheaper variants, eligibility for federal tax credits, and increased discounts..As of March 2025, fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks had been delivered, and around 10,000 remain unsold across the US. Tesla experienced a 13% year-over-year drop in total deliveries in Q1 2025, which the company attributed partly to the Model Y design refresh causing a production bottleneck. However, current estimates suggest that Q2 2025 deliveries could be down as much as 19% to 20% compared to Q2 2024.

But 2025 is shaping up to be one of the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s most challenging years in recent memory, with its stock facing significant volatility. While Tesla’s rebound from its April lows briefly offered some relief to investors, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan has recently issued a grave warning: Tesla could post its first year of negative free cash flow since 2018..In a recent research note, Langan pointed to multiple headwinds dragging on Tesla’s financial health, including weak delivery numbers, risks to income from regulatory credits, aggressive capital expenditures, and pricing pressures. That’s a sharp reversal from the narrative of financial resilience that Tesla has leaned on in the past, and it casts a shadow over investor hopes that its Robotaxi and Optimus initiatives will materialize fast enough to justify the current sky-high valuation..The Next Trillion-Dollar Boom? 3 Stocks to Buy with 300 Million Humanoid Robots on the Horizon..Is Tesla a Buy or Sell as TSLA Stock Zooms on Austin Robotaxi Launch?.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Now Pays 5% of All Corporate Income Taxes in America.Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most.

With that, let’s get into it!.Tesla (TSLA) is a prominent innovator dedicated to accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy. The Elon Musk-led powerhouse designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. It also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and various other services related to its products. In addition, the company is increasingly focusing on products and services centered around AI, robotics, and automation. Its market cap currently stands at $1.04 trillion..Shares of the EV maker have slumped 12.8% on a year-to-date basis. TSLA stock had a rough start to 2025, tumbling from mid-January highs near $430 per share to a low of $218.80 by early April..The stock was weighed down by slowing EV sales, CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities, and escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. TSLA stock found support around the $220 level as broader market sentiment steadied following President Donald Trump’s decision to pause or reduce most of his tariffs. From a technical analysis standpoint, some traders interpret the price action as forming a triple bottom pattern, while others see an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The price then broke above the slice neckline in late April, climbing as high as $362.89. The upward move was fueled by several factors, including the U.S.-China trade truce, Musk’s pledge to step back from U.S. politics and refocus on Tesla, and renewed investor enthusiasm over the company’s self-driving advancements. However, the positive momentum has since faded, with TSLA shares pulling back and experiencing a sharp drop in early June amid the Trump-Musk feud. As tensions between Trump and Musk eased, the stock staged a modest rebound and has since been trading within a narrow range.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsla-stock-warning-tesla-could-194607736.html

But can Tesla really scale this?,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) just gave Wall Street a new reason to believe in its AI-first future. On Sunday, the company quietly rolled out a limited fleet of robotaxis in Austin, Texas offering $4.20 flat-fee rides without human drivers. It's the first time real passengers have paid to ride fully autonomous Teslas, and on Monday, the market responded in kind: the stock jumped 10%, adding nearly $100 billion to Tesla's valuation. For Elon Musk, it's a critical pivot away from chasing mass EV adoption, and toward a bet-the-company push into autonomy and robotics..Early reactions? Mixed, but promising. Wedbush's Dan Ives took multiple rides and called the experience comfortable and safe, noting how the car handled narrow roads, traffic, and human unpredictability with striking caution. Influencers on X flooded the feed with real-world footage, showing Teslas navigating tight city blocks and reacting to opening car doors without panic. But it's still early. Just 10 cars, front-seat monitors still present, and a Texas law kicking in this September will require a state permit. Plus, Tesla's camera-and-AI-only approach (no lidar or radar) continues to raise red flags with safety advocates especially in fog, rain, or low sun..If the rally holds, Tesla inches back toward its $1 trillion crown. But the stock's still down 12% in 2024, as investors wrestle with slumping EV demand and the brand baggage of Musk's political takes. And at 149x forward earnings? It's priced more like a moonshot AI play than an automaker. Ford (NYSE:F) trades at 9.3x. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) sits at 31.6x. That leaves Tesla with a simple but brutal test: can this robotaxi rollout scale fast enough and safe enough to justify the hype investors just bought into?.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-4-20-robotaxi-just-192519869.html

The firm acknowledged Tesla’s sheer weight in the U.S. EV market, which still commands around half the market as of late 2024, and its nearly trillion-dollar valuation. But lately, the stock hasn’t been moving in step with its usual..At the heart of the issue was Elon Musk’s political fallout with Donald Trump. Things got messy after Musk criticized a congressional spending bill, which led the President to suggest Musk’s outrage stemmed from the bill axing EV tax credits. The noise wasn't just political, it affected the brand and stock alike..Tesla’s Q1 2025 results came in soft, and added fuel to Argus’ downgrade decision. Still, the firm expected Tesla to weather the global EV turbulence. The upcoming Model 2, Tesla’s promised budget option, along with AI ventures like Cybercab and the Optimus robot, may give the stock a lift, at-least in the short term..Yet Argus pointed to a persistent drag: Musk himself. His high-profile feuds and increasingly divisive public image are turning off portions of the market. Cybertrucks piling up without buyers is one indication of that..Even so, Argus stuck by its broader faith in Tesla’s future. The company remains the rare EV maker with real profits, and it’s still pushing into energy storage, self-driving tech, and robotics..TSLA shares returned around 20% since Argus' report..While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

2025-06-24 00:25:00,Tesla finally began a limited version of long-promised robotaxi service. But there were some bumps,Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi service began in Austin Texas for a select group of the company’s fans.,"Tesla’s much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company’s fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat..It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step..Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet..But the start of the Tesla service Sunday was only a fraction of any of that. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March..But the Austin test pressed on regardless..The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives’ team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday..Ives’ note to clients, which cited how a Tesla “safety monitor” sat in the front passenger seat while no person was in the driver’s seat, praised the quality of the rides taken by his team member..“We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.”.But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. In one YouTube video, the robotaxi drove on the wrong side of the road after it attempted and abandoned a left turn, only to continue traveling down the street on the opposite side of a double yellow line before making the left turn on the following block. Fortunately, there were no vehicles driving on the other side of the road.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-finally-began-limited-version-162518514.html

TSLA shares are breaking out above multi-week highs and are up more than 6% in early trading as volume turnover is swelling and tracking to levels of more than 60% above the 50-day average volume..Image Source: TradingView.Silicon Valley legends like Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t get to where they are without massive risk-taking and a ‘move fast, break things’ approach. For instance, after Elon Musk scored his first $175 million fortune with the successful sale of PayPal (PYPL) to eBay (EBAY), he immediately began deploying most (but not all) of his capital to his new endeavors – SpaceX and Tesla. However, when the 2008 Global Financial Crisis hit, Musk was forced to risk all of his capital (and actually had to borrow money) to survive. The bet paid off, and the rest is history – Musk became the wealthiest person on Earth..Whether it’s X.com (formally Twitter) or SpaceX, Musk prefers to move at lightning speed and fix mistakes later. Nevertheless, Musk is wisely taking a measured approach with the robotaxi debut since the stakes are high. With global car sales slumping and Musk’s recent political, reputational damage, Tesla’s robotaxi service must move forward without a hitch. As a result, Tesla is debuting the robotaxi in a geo-fenced-in zone, charging a low fee of $4.20, and has a safety rider in the front passenger seat to ensure the debut goes smoothly. Thus far, investors are cheering the measured side of Elon Musk..The robotaxi launch is invite-only and includes social media personalities and investors. Tesla is using modified Model Y vehicles (the best-selling car currently) with updated software instead of the futuristic Cybercab concept Musk initially pitched. The move to use Model Ys was likely to avoid falling further behind Alphabet’s (GOOGL) rapidly expanding ‘Waymo’ robotaxi service. With Waymo already operating in Austin, investors will be watching to see which service clients choose once Tesla opens up its robotaxi service to the public..Between Musk’s controversies and slowing sales, TSLA still has its fair share of skeptics. For example, prominent short seller Jim Chanos is bearish on the company, citing valuation concerns and competition. However, these skeptics will likely have to eat their words if Musk and his Tesla team can scale its robotaxi service into 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-debuts-pivotal-moment-154300477.html

While both Musk and Tesla are not exactly known for their steadfast commitment to deadlines, it was a welcome break, especially given the fact that the project is running late by years and Musk once touted that 1 million robotaxis would be on the road by 2020..Both Tesla bulls and bears were eagerly waiting for the robotaxi launch, given how important that service is for the long-term Tesla story.

The cars were accompanied by a “safety monitor” who did not sit in the driver’s seat, but did sit in the passenger seat..On the bullish side, the launch was held on time, there were no reports of mishaps with the rides, and it was “unsupervised” as technically there was no one at the steering wheel. For context, Tesla advises users to keep their hands on the steering wheel all the time while using its full self-driving technology (supervised) – the same technology that lays the foundation for the robotaxi. Wedbush analyst and long-time Tesla bull Dan Ives was among those who rode Tesla’s robotaxi and came back impressed, saying it exceeded his expectations..Tesla bears, too, have something to talk about, as it wasn’t “unsupervised” in a strict sense. Moreover, the company seems to have carefully vetted the initial set of passengers to avoid any negative feedback. While both Tesla bulls and bears can claim some victory after the robotaxi launch, the former camp seems to have an upper hand, which is also reflected in today’s price action..That said, by Musk’s assertion, the robotaxi service won’t move the needle for the company financially until next year. During the Q1 2025 earnings call, he “bet” that there would be “millions of Teslas operating autonomously” in the back half of 2026.

2025-06-23 23:30:00,Tesla Stock Climbs After Launching Exclusive Robotaxi Pilot in Austin,Tesla's Bold Robotaxi Debut in Austin Fuels Investor Hype,"June 23 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained nearly 8% on Monday trading after kicking off a limited robotaxi rollout in Austin, Texas, marking a bold step in its push toward full autonomy..The debut took place Sunday and is invite-only, with access granted to a select group of Tesla enthusiasts, investors, and influencers. Photos and videos of the sleek, self-driving Model Y vehicles quickly surfaced across social media..Each car is equipped with Tesla's advanced Full Self-Driving software, powered by AI and a vision-based system. Unlike rivals that rely on lidar and radar, Tesla is doubling down on its camera-only approach..Despite earlier promises of true autonomy, a Tesla employee is currently seated in the passenger side to monitor rides. The driver's seat remains empty, but the vehicles are restricted to geo-fenced neighborhoods in Austin..CEO Elon Musk confirmed fewer than a dozen cars were deployed for the soft launch. The move comes just days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law requiring autonomous vehicles to receive state permits to operate without human drivers, putting Tesla on the clock, with a deadline looming Sept. 1..The pilot feels more like a preview than a breakthrough, but it could be an early sign Tesla's long-term autonomy vision is starting to take shape..Based on the one year price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average target price for Tesla Inc is $289.30 with a high estimate of $500.00 and a low estimate of $19.05. The average target implies a downside of -10.20% from the current price of $322.16..Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $267.12, suggesting a downside of -17.08% from the current price of $322.16..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-climbs-launching-exclusive-134337601.html

The sharp decline was triggered by a public spat between TSLA CEO Elon Musk and President Trump..Musk publicly criticized the President's proposed tax and spending legislation, cheekily called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."".Among other things, the bill has implications for EV subsidies, which are vital to Tesla's business model. The bill would scale back numerous tax credits for the purchase and production of EVs, which also includes the $7,500 consumer credit. The bill would also eliminate tailpipe-emission rules that incentivize car manufacturers to electrify their up and upcoming models over the next decade..Musk, in addition to concerns over EV tax credits and personal attacks on the POTUS, also expressed concerns over the bill's ""potential to increase the national deficit by $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years."" The white house, on the other hand, has disputed the claim..POTUS, in response, threatened to cut off federal contracts with Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX..""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"".However, by the next day, the stock rebounded over 5%, and recovered some of the lost ground. The recovery was due to the reports suggesting a potential de-escalation between Musk and Trump, although the White House later denied any scheduled call..Despite the rebound, analysts remain cautious and noted that the feud could have long-term implications for Musk's companies with the federal government, especially regarding regulatory approvals for innovations like driverless robotaxis..While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The rides were being offered for a flat fee of $4.20 in a limited zone..The trial's success is crucial for Tesla as Musk has pivoted the company to self-driving cars and robots, shelving plans for mass-market dominance in the EV space as Chinese competition heats up and demand slows for its aging line-up of models..Tesla told U.S. regulators on Monday that its answers on the safety of the robotaxi deployment are confidential business information and should not be made public, after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was reviewing answers given in response to its questions about the safety of the robotaxi in poor weather among numerous issues..""It was a comfortable, safe, and personalized experience,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who took multiple robotaxi rides on Sunday and has long been a Tesla bull..""There was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the robotaxi masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety."".Many social-media influencers also posted videos of their first rides on X, showing the cars navigating busy city streets by slowing down and making room for incoming traffic..Still, the tightly controlled trial - with about 10 vehicles and front-seat riders acting as ""safety monitors"" - is just the first step in what could be a years-long process of scaling up the service, according to some industry experts..Tesla, as well as rivals including Google-backed Waymo, have faced federal investigations and recalls following collisions..Industry experts have questioned the efficacy of Tesla's self-driving technology that depends mostly on cameras and AI, without redundant sensors such as lidar and radar, claiming fog, heavy rain and glaring sunlight can hamper safety..The company will also have to navigate a new Texas law taking effect September 1 that requires a state permit for self-driving vehicles and reflects bipartisan calls for a cautious roll-out..If Monday's gains hold, Tesla - the world's most valuable automaker - will add nearly $100 billion to its market value of about $1 trillion. The stock has declined about 12% so far this year, dragged down by concerns about demand and brand damage from Musk's embrace of right-wing politics in Europe and support for U.S. President Donald Trump.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-shares-soar-first-robotaxi-145744251.html

TSLA’s trailing and forward P/E were 184.09 and 166.67, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance..A modern electric vehicle charging at an electric car station..Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report confirmed deep operational challenges, with revenue from its core electric vehicle business plunging 20% year-over-year and falling below 2023 levels. Operating income dropped by two-thirds, with the auto segment slipping into the red. Management has withheld forward guidance, citing uncertainties and transitional disruptions, including a Model Y production shift..Despite these bleak figures, Tesla’s stock has continued its meteoric rise, up 70% from a year ago, driven by investor faith in Elon Musk’s bold AI ambitions. Musk, pledging reduced political engagement and increased CEO focus, maintains Tesla should be viewed not as a carmaker but as a future leader in AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robotics. Tesla plans to launch a limited robotaxi trial in Austin by June with a small fleet of Model Ys aided by remote operators—an approach that resembles Waymo’s model but sans LIDAR, relying solely on cameras and AI..While Musk insists this is scalable, critics argue it's overly ambitious. Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot, is another linchpin in Musk’s vision, with plans for thousands in production by 2025 and over a million sold annually by 2030. However, component export restrictions and regulatory concerns cloud that timeline..Meanwhile, Tesla’s booming energy storage business grew 67% in Q1, though future tariffs may impact it. Valued at $800 billion, Tesla’s stock reflects massive belief in unproven technologies, with its traditional auto business possibly justifying 10% of that figure. Skeptics now expect full-year losses, and short positions are growing. Yet, Musk’s unpredictability means anything—from flying cybercabs to MAGA drones—could reshape the narrative again..Previously we covered a bearish thesis on Tesla, Inc. by Stefan Waldhauser in February 2025, which highlighted brand erosion, internal talent issues, and overreliance on speculative AI promises.

After years of bold promises, Elon Musk’s company finally began ferrying passengers on their own without a human directly behind the wheel..While the first impressions were heavily positive, that should come as little surprise. The selection of passengers for the invite-only test skewed toward Tesla bulls, including Dan Ives. The Wedbush tech analyst argues the stock should be worth double its current $1 trillion market value, and currently recommends it as a buy with a $500 price target..“Overall, these Robotaxis exceeded our expectations and offered a seamless and personalized travel experience that has lit the spark for autonomous driving,” Ives told his clients in a research note on Sunday, summing up his experience as “very impressive.”.On the one hand, the day marked a historic milestone for Tesla, whose shares are set to open 1.7% higher in a flat market..For the very first time, a manufacturer heavily reliant on hardware sales—the delivery of electric vehicles—demonstrated it was on the path to becoming a company that one day could earn a substantial share of its profits from high-margin software and services..Nevertheless, it wasn’t anywhere near the “ChatGPT moment” the Tesla CEO has promised for the past two years..No switch was flipped that suddenly made millions of Tesla vehicles capable of driving themselves without human supervision, as Musk has prophesied..Instead rides were limited largely to a number of prominent Tesla-friendly influencers, most of whom had traveled from out-of-town to Austin just to participate in the launch..The exact number of cars participating in the pilot on Sunday is unknown. Musk indicated he initially wanted only around a dozen or so to mitigate the risk and ensure maximum safety..Tesla employees serving as safety monitors were seated at all times in the front passenger seat, though it was unclear what influence they had, if any, over the vehicle or whether the vehicle was, at times, being tele-operated remotely..Since the rides were geofenced to an area of southern Austin, the trips charged for the symbolic price of $4.20 each (a marijuana reference Musk often uses) tended to be short.

2025-06-23 21:39:00,Tesla Launches Robotaxi in Austin: Are Industry Dynamics Favorable?,"TSLA kicks off its first paid robotaxi rides in Austin, testing autonomous tech as rivals race to scale nationwide.","Tesla TSLA launched a small group of self-driving taxi service in Austin, TX, marking the first time its autonomous vehicles transported paying passengers without a human driver behind the wheel. CEO Elon Musk confirmed the robotaxi launch, while social media influencers shared videos of their inaugural rides. The pilot is considered a key step toward Musk's broader vision of autonomous mobility as a major revenue driver for the company.A small fleet of around 10 Tesla vehicles was seen operating in the South Congress area without a driver, but a passenger in the front seat acting as a safety monitor. However, the extent of their control over the vehicles remains unclear. Tesla had invited a select group of influencers to participate in the trial, which was tightly controlled and restricted to a specific area. Per Musk’s post on X, rides were priced at a flat rate of $4.20.As the launch approached, Texas lawmakers passed new legislation regulating autonomous vehicles. Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring companies to obtain state permits to operate driverless cars. The law, set to take effect on Sept. 1, 2025, indicates that state leaders from both political parties are urging the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed with caution.Tesla’s high-profile launch comes as other players in the space are also racing to expand robotaxi services. However, with rising regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns — highlighted by Texas’ new permit law — industry momentum remains uncertain. TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..Zoox, Amazon’s AMZN autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has opened its first dedicated robotaxi manufacturing facility in California, marking a key step toward launching its commercial self-driving taxi service in the United States. Amazon Zoox is actively testing a fleet of more than 20 driverless vehicles in various American cities. In San Francisco, operations are currently focused on the South of Market district. Amazon Zoox plans to soon offer test rides to the public.Alphabet’s GOOGL self-driving division, Waymo, announced that it will restart autonomous vehicle testing in New York City next month as part of a broader strategy to expand its operations nationwide. The Alphabet subsidiary views New York’s dense and dynamic urban landscape as an essential proving ground for its technology. Waymo remains the only U.S. firm offering a commercial robotaxi service to paying passengers. With a fleet exceeding 1,500 vehicles, Alphabet Waymo facilitates more than 250,000 rides each week in major cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-launches-robotaxi-austin-industry-133900767.html
2025-06-23 22:07:00,Ford Stock Looks Cheap at 0.26X P/S - But is It Worth Buying?,"F appears attractively valued and yields over 5%, but mounting EV and tariff headwinds raise caution.","U.S. legacy automaker Ford F is currently trading at a 0.26 forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, below the industry levels as well as its own 5-year average. The valuation also stacks up favorably against its closest peer, General Motors GM, and the electric vehicle giant, Tesla TSLA. General Motors has a P/S of 0.27X, while Tesla is trading at a much loftier 9.88X multiple. Of course, Tesla’s valuation is less tied to current fundamentals and more driven by optimism around unproven future bets, like robotaxis and artificial intelligence..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.Ford looks undervalued despite the stock rising roughly 7% year to date against the industry’s loss of more than 19%. Over the same timeframe, shares of General Motors have declined almost 10%, and Tesla slid 20%..Image Source: Zacks Investment Research.With Ford’s valuation looking cheap, the real question now is whether Ford has the momentum and fundamentals to deliver a real upside from here..Ford remains a key player in the U.S. auto market, with a lineup that continues to resonate with American buyers. The F-Series trucks continue to be a best-seller, and models like the Maverick pickup, Escape, Explorer, Expedition, and Edge keep Ford well-positioned in the SUV and crossover space..One of the major key catalysts for Ford currently is its Ford Pro business, which is focused on commercial customers. The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future for the Ford Pro segment. The growing interest in its software and service offerings is also driving the unit’s earnings. The segment has around 675,000 paid software subscriptions, with strong ARPU growth driving incremental revenues. Software services also serve as a countercyclical measure for the segment..Ford’s healthy balance sheet and investor-friendly moves instill investor confidence. The company ended the first quarter of 2025 with roughly $45 billion in liquidity, including around $27 billion in cash. Its superior liquidity profile provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities. Encouragingly, Ford is on track to deliver $1 billion in net cost reductions this year, excluding tariff effects..Ford’s dividend yield of over 5% stands out as an attractive option for income-focused investors, especially when stacked against the S&P 500’s average yield of just more than 1%. With plans to return 40-50% of its free cash flow to shareholders, Ford underscores its commitment to rewarding investors, even as it navigates a major transformation of its business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-looks-cheap-0-130700382.html

It's a potential sign of growth for robotaxis, industry observers say.","This story was originally published on Smart Cities Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Smart Cities Dive newsletter. .Tesla launched its robotaxi service Sunday in Austin, Texas. Rides are limited to an invited group of what appear mainly to be social media influencers and Tesla supporters..The robotaxi service will operate from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. Central Time in limited areas of Austin, according to Tesla. A Tesla safety monitor accompanies each ride, sitting in the front passenger seat. Riders are not allowed to sit in the driver’s seat..Before Tesla can operate robotaxis without a human driver, it will have to comply with new Texas regulations signed into law June 20 that go into effect Sept. 1. Some state lawmakers asked Tesla to delay autonomous robotaxi operations until the new law takes effect, saying, “We believe this is in the best interest of public safety and building public trust in Tesla's operations.”.Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to operate robotaxi service in California and Texas during an event in October featuring a two-seat driverless vehicle it called a Cybercab. Tesla Model Y SUVs are providing the robotaxi service in Austin instead..“Probably for the first few months, they're going to have a lot of supervision,” Andrew Rocco, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in an interview. Rocco believes Musk wants to make sure that Tesla’s Full Self Driving software “is absolutely safe” before a full launch..Rocco is also optimistic about Tesla’s success against competitors like Waymo and Zoox in the robotaxi industry. “None of these [competitors], at the moment or anywhere in the near future, are going to be able to simply produce enough cars that are needed,” he said. Rocco sees Tesla ultimately commanding 60% to 70% of the robotaxi market, with Waymo at 20% and others divvying up the remainder..Musk said during the company’s April 22 earnings call “that there will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously, fully autonomously, in the second half of next year.”.Waymo has “more vehicles, more visibility” than other robotaxi companies, said Craig Melrose, global managing partner, advanced technologies at HTEC, a product development and digital engineering company. Melrose acknowledged, however, that Tesla has more autonomous driving data collected from its many vehicles on the road, and “they may know something that none of us know.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-begins-robotaxi-rollout-austin-114800570.html

The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy..The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC..E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10.

Barriers to entry are therefore high, and auto manufacturers with economies of scale can boast strong economic moats. However, this doesn’t insulate them from new entrants, as electric vehicles (EVs) have entered the market and are upending it. This has forced established manufacturers to not only contend with emerging EV-first competitors but also decide how much they want to invest in these disruptive technologies, which will likely cannibalize their legacy offerings..The 7 automobile manufacturing stocks we track reported a strong Q1.

2025-06-23 04:58:00,Tesla launches robotaxi rides in Austin with big promises and unanswered questions,"Tesla has started giving rides in driverless Model Y SUVs in Austin. Details are still sparse, but limited service is open to vetted and invited riders.","Tesla has started giving rides in driverless Model Y SUVs in Austin, a decade after CEO Elon Musk began making — and breaking — myriad promises about his company’s ability to launch such a service..The rollout will become the first big test of Musk’s belief that it’s possible to safely deploy fully autonomous vehicles using just cameras and end-to-end AI – an approach that differs from other players in the space like Waymo..On Sunday, numerous videos shared on social media, as well as sources in the city, confirmed what Musk has been teasing for months: that the rides are finally happening, at a surely coincidental flat fee of $4.20 per ride..Tesla sent early-access invitations in the past week to vetted customers, who were able to download and use the new robotaxi app on Sunday to hail rides. It’s unclear how many people have received this invitation. But posts on Musk’s social media platform X show that many of them went to Tesla’s loudest online supporters..The invitations, along with a new robotaxi information page published on Tesla’s website on June 22, confirm the service will operate every day from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. but “may be limited or unavailable in the event of inclement weather.” And, notably, a Tesla employee will be sitting in the right front passenger seat as a “safety monitor.”.The robotaxi information page also includes instructions on downloading the app, how to report a lost item, and general rules for riders. It still glosses over the kind of specifics that Waymo — the Alphabet-owned AV company that operates commercial robotaxis in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin — has historically provided..The robotaxi service will be small to start, according to Musk. The initial fleet will include about ten 2025 Model Y SUVs operating in a narrowly defined area of South Austin. That’s in line with a firsthand account by Ed Niedermeyer, author of “Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors,” who is in Austin to monitor the robotaxi rollout. (Niedermeyer is a co-host of The Autonocast with TechCrunch editor Kirsten Korosec.).Niedermeyer found what appears to be a Tesla robotaxi depot — a nondescript parking lot dotted with trees near Oltorf Street in South Austin. The day before the launch, he spotted several driverless Model Ys — always with an employee behind the steering wheel — entering and exiting the parking lot. Groups of other Tesla Model Y vehicles, most with manufacturer plates, were also parked there..This morning, he spotted the branded Tesla Model Y robotaxis, this time with the employee in the front passenger seat, leaving the holding area. He observed one of the branded robotaxis, which had not yet picked up a rider, suddenly hitting its brakes two separate times — once in the middle of an intersection. It’s unclear why the vehicle behaved that way. However, in a video, which TechCrunch has viewed and which has since been posted on YouTube, both instances occurred as the Tesla passed by police vehicles that were located in parking lots adjacent to the roadway.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-austin-205802328.html

The launch comes despite lawmakers' letter pushing for delays until September when updated autonomous vehicle legislation takes effect, highlighting the regulatory challenges facing widespread adoption of self-driving technology. Tesla robotaxi sightings have become increasingly common on Austin's public roads ahead of the planned launch, suggesting the company remains committed to its timeline despite political pressure. The success or failure of this launch could significantly impact not only Tesla's valuation but also broader market sentiment toward autonomous driving technology and artificial intelligence applications. Competitors in the autonomous vehicle space, traditional automakers investing in self-driving technology, and companies developing supporting infrastructure could see notable volatility based on Tesla's performance..Powell's Dual Commentary.Fed Chair Jerome Powell's scheduled speeches on Tuesday at 10am and Wednesday at 10am create back-to-back opportunities for market-moving commentary on monetary policy and economic assessment. Following last week's Fed decision that maintained current rates amid Middle East tensions, Powell's remarks will be closely analyzed for insights into how geopolitical developments might influence future policy considerations. The Tuesday speech coincides exactly with the Consumer Confidence report release, creating potential for amplified market reactions if Powell's commentary aligns with or contradicts household sentiment data. Wednesday's remarks come alongside new home sales data, providing context for the Fed's view on housing market conditions and their broader economic implications. With energy prices remaining elevated due to Middle East tensions and key inflation data arriving Friday, Powell's assessment of price stability risks could significantly influence rate-sensitive sectors including technology, utilities, and financials. Any evolution in the Fed's thinking about the balance between geopolitical risks and domestic economic conditions could trigger substantial sector rotation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotaxis-powell-other-key-things-170002705.html

Tesla could still be a highly lucrative investment if its robotaxi business succeeds.","Ark Invest's price targets on Tesla shouldn't be taken too literally and may prove overly optimistic (again), but they are based on sound arguments..Tesla has a history of overpromising and underdelivering on full self-driving..Tesla could still be a highly lucrative investment if its robotaxi business succeeds..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has been one of the most vocal supporters of and investors in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and it's no secret in the investing world that Ark has a $2,600 price target on the stock for 2029. Still, what does that target mean, and does Ark's reasoning make sense? Here's the lowdown..The investment company's price target won't be ""right,"" but then again, it's not supposed to be. It's an expected case scenario produced by a Monte Carlo simulation. In other words, Ark plugged numerous variables into an algorithm and ran a vast number of computer simulations to model a range of randomized outcomes. It's not necessary to get into the weeds about how these simulations are done; suffice it to say that on the bearish side, Ark's model shows a 25% chance that Tesla's stock price will be $2,000 or less in 2029, and on the bullish side, it finds a 25% chance that it will be $3,100 or more. Roughly in the middle lies Ark's expected value of $2,600 for the shares..The modeling itself is almost certainly wrong, simply because it relies on variables that are incredibly hard to predict..To illustrate just how challenging it can be to make accurate stock forecasts using this kind of simulation, let's revisit the predictions Ark made in 2021 and 2023 for Tesla's share prices in 2025 and 2026, respectively..Tesla's current stock price in 2025 is about $320..Tesla Price Targets.Ark 2021 Forecast for 2025.Ark 2022 Forecast for 2026.Bear case.$1,500.$2,900.Bull case.$4,000.$5,800.Expected value.$3,000.$4,600.Data source: Ark Invest presentations..Tesla's stock price is currently far below even the bearish scenario Ark simulated in 2021, and it would have to increase by 806% to hit the bear case scenario for 2026 that was projected in 2022..All of which is not to criticize Ark, because modeling the long-term value of a speculative growth stock like Tesla is incredibly difficult. The point is not to take the targets too literally..But if investors can't take such price targets as gospel, is there anything to be gleaned from Ark's analysis?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-actually-tesla-stock-163400270.html

While he agrees that no one wants their tax dollars wasted and supports cutting government waste, he warned that it must be done carefully — “with a scalpel, not a chainsaw.”.Reich explained that businesses are focused on profit. “Corporations like McDonald’s and Walmart, they don’t exist for the public good. They exist to maximize their shareholder returns,” he said. That often means low wages and minimal benefits for workers, many of whom rely on taxpayer-funded programs like food stamps and Medicaid to make ends meet..“Do you know what it means when somebody pays you minimum wage?

The broader EV industry might be sputtering right now, and investors might be grappling with the impact of tariffs, but Lucid has been on fire, in a good way.","Lucid has posted six consecutive quarters of record deliveries..Analysts expect the electric vehicle maker's sales to nearly double next year..Lucid's future growth will be driven by a selection of models on a midsize platform..10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›.Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) appears to be one of the benefactors of Tesla's recent stumble and fall. Lucid management noted an uptick in customers trading in their Teslas for a possibly less politically charged ride. And while the broader U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry is struggling to grow as many anticipated, Lucid has set itself up extremely well for growth over the coming year..But does all this make it a buy finally? Let's find out..The broader EV industry might be sputtering right now, and investors might be grappling with the impact of tariffs, but Lucid has been on fire, in a good way. Lucid delivered 3,109 vehicles during the first quarter, a solid 58% jump compared to the prior year..It marked the sixth straight quarter for record deliveries, and it comes right on the cusp of Lucid accelerating production and deliveries for its most recent launch, the Gravity SUV. Lucid had only recently become satisfied with producing all the inventory needed for employees, studios, and test driving, and can now accelerate production for mainstream consumers..For investors who have grown accustomed to Lucid's strong delivery performance after years of disappointments, the good news is that the Gravity SUV should easily drive the company's results going forward. In fact, the Gravity SUV is estimated to have a market size six times that of Lucid's Air sedan. Analysts expect Lucid sales to increase 73% in 2025 and another 96% jump in 2026 compared to prior years..That's not even taking into account the upcoming midsize platform that will underpin numerous models at a more affordable price tag..Lucid's surge also comes at a good time as once-dominant EV player Tesla is facing consumer backlash due to CEO Elon Musk's brief stint in politics, which has resulted in the downward spiral of sales in key markets. In fact, Lucid's interim CEO, Marc Winterhoff, even noted there was a dramatic uptick in recent months in orders from former Tesla drivers..With momentum seemingly in Lucid's corner in the near-term, despite a stagnating U.S. EV market, it might look like a good time for long-term investors to jump in. But there are a few things to consider..The first red flag came after reporting a near $400 million fourth-quarter loss when the EV maker announced that CEO Peter Rawlinson, who led the company for 12 years, would be stepping down. Lucid did its best to downplay the situation, but analysts weren't buying it, going as far to say product development could stall, consumer demand could be dampened, and additional funding opportunities could be at risk.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/growth-poised-explode-lucid-stock-124500156.html

Tesla is already a highly successful automaker and the dominant player in electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., and robotaxis offer the prospect of transforming it into a company able to generate high-margin and recurring revenue from owning its robotaxi fleet or revenue sharing from Tesla's transformed fleet using Full Self-Driving (FSD) software..There's also the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, and the potential to sell FSD on a subscription basis.

Nvidia believes they will be more efficient, with lower maintenance costs and significantly lower costs of ownership..The new data centers, scheduled for 2027, employ a different power conversion method, and Navitas is developing Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) power semiconductors to enable more efficient power conversion in 800V HVDC data centers..Similarly, another Nvidia partner, and leading data center equipment provider, Vertiv, is developing critical power and cooling equipment and systems for the new data centers and expects to have them available in the second half of 2026, in time for the launch of the 800V HVDC data center in 2027.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-brilliant-growth-stocks-buy-091000299.html

Buzz AD. But instead of competing against existing transportation providers, it aims to work with them as a partner. The different approach comes amid continued popular resentment towards robotaxis..When Big Tech first began deploying self-driving cars to San Francisco two years ago, companies encountered something unusual—popular resistance..Angry residents would sabotage the robotaxis with the help of traffic cones, while the city’s fire department chief herself would regularly malign them as a dangerous nuisance. Even today, during the recent outbreak of civil unrest in Los Angeles over mass deportations, protesters caused hundreds of thousands of dollars when they deliberately torched Waymo cars..One old economy company preparing to enter the autonomous ride-hailing space is taking a completely different approach when it launches next year. Germany’s Volkswagen is wagering society at large is increasingly fed up with the collateral damage left behind by Silicon Valley’s move-fast-and-break-things mentality..“Our approach is different—we deliberately want to act as partners that build upon existing infrastructure,” VW Group executive Sascha Meyer told Fortune during a test drive of its robotaxi. “A key point for social acceptance we believe is being a service provider whose presence is desired precisely because we will not be competing with systems already in place.”.This week, VW revealed the series production version of its autonomous ride-hailing cab based on its retro-styled VW ID.

2025-06-22 08:13:00,Would you hail a 'robotaxi'? Musk bets cabs will give Tesla a lift after boycotts and sales plunge,"Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla “robotaxis” would be on the road “next year,” but it didn’t happen.  Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”  While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster.","NEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla “robotaxis” would be on the road “next year,” but it didn’t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn’t happen either..Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”.Would you settle for 10 or 12?.Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, that began Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success..The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges..While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride..Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks..Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322. At midday Monday, the shares were up 10% as investors reacted positively to the rollout..Musk seemed jubilant Sunday morning, posting on X, “The @Tesla_AI robotaxi launch begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee!”.The test is beginning modestly enough. Tesla is remotely monitoring the vehicles and putting a person in the passenger seat in case of trouble. The number of Teslas deployed will also be small — just 10 or 12 vehicles — and will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area..Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year..Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical..“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hail-robotaxi-musk-bets-cabs-001323345.html

More debt could lead to higher interest rates over the long term.  The highly public spat between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the One, Big, Beautiful Bill highlights an ongoing, decades-long debate over national debt.","As Elon Musk argues, rising national debt and debt servicing costs are curtailing the growth prospects of the U.S. economy..More debt could lead to higher interest rates over the long term..These stocks are beneficiaries of rising interest rates..10 stocks we like better than Prudential Financial ›.The highly public spat between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the One, Big, Beautiful Bill highlights an ongoing, decades-long debate over national debt. The focus of this article is to explore a potential scenario and suggest a way to invest in protection against it..That path is via life and retirement insurance companies like Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU), MetLife (NYSE: MET), and Corebridge Financial (NYSE: CRBG). Here's why..This chart gets to the heart of the matter. As shown below, the U.S. national debt has increased substantially, and so has the level of debt in relation to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). The shaded areas show recessionary periods, including the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the pandemic, whereby GDP contracted and spending soared, so naturally, the debt-to-GDP ratio did, too..Still, the response in both cases was the same: more spending and more debt..Musk's view is that the national debt issue needs to be addressed as it's out of control and has the potential to saddle Americans with an unsustainable debt burden, which the bill will exacerbate. To be fair, the Trump administration's aim is not to increase the deficit as officials believe it will lower the deficit, through implementation of mandatory savings and promoting GDP growth..Again, this is not the place to debate that matter. However, what if Musk is right and the U.S. continues down the path of rising debt?.Rising debt levels and debt servicing payments imply more debt issuance. Simple economics argues that, unless demand improves, the rising supply of debt will lead to a rise in the price of debt. In other words, long-term interest rates will rise, and could be higher than the market is expecting..The chart below indicates that the market is comfortable with the matter and isn't attaching a significant premium (beyond the usual premium to reflect the increased risk of holding longer-dated debt) to long-term interest rates over medium-term rates..But the market could be wrong. And while Musk's primary concern appears to be the difficulty of cutting rates caused by rising debt, it's only a short step away to argue that rising debt could lead to higher long-term interest rates.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-u-national-debt-201000974.html

Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same. So, which company is better placed to thrive in the future?.Tesla's launch of its full-self-driving (FSD) robotaxi is sometimes seen as a tactical move as its electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share come under pressure in 2025, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that major automakers, including Ford, and leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving, and it's an integral part of the future of the auto industry..The reason behind the investment is a recognition that robotaxis have huge profit potential, not least because they offer a long stream of recurring income from ride-per-mile revenue..Another reality is that EVs are not cheap, and if they are the future of the auto industry, automakers need to make them more affordable. They also need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable..However, don't take my word for it. Here's Ford's CEO Jim Farley in 2019 on autonomous driving and robotaxis: ""The self-driving system is incredibly important to develop, but it's just one part of building a safe and scalable self-driving service that consumers can trust."" Farley went on to outline a timeline for a ""commercial self-driving service"" in 2021, which Ford would fail to achieve..As for affordable EVs, last year, Farley reiterated the need to offer smaller and more affordable EVs to achieve profitability as an EV maker..The two things are strongly connected. You can't have robotaxi EVs if the vehicles aren't affordable. That's a point that resonated during a recent CNBC interview with Waymo, which has a robotaxi service already in place, yet co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana declined to outline a timeline for the company's profitability. Waymo's lack of profitability means its owner, Alphabet, is going to have to invest significant sums, at a loss, if it wants Waymo to build scale. That creates a huge opportunity for a company like Tesla that is just entering the market and potentially offers a much more commercial and scalable service.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-200500011.html

For starters, post-pandemic inflation caused the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates, making it harder for consumers to access credit to afford Lucid's high-priced sedans (the flagship Lucid Air starts at $71,400).","Lucid's new SUV could help to supercharge growth..Is it finally time to bet on this long-suffering EV stock?.10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›.Smaller stocks are ideal for investors willing to take additional risks for the potential for multi-bagger returns. With a stock price of just $2.22 (corresponding to a market cap of $6.77 billion), Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) fits into this category. But the electric vehicle maker didn't get this cheap by accident. Let's dig deeper to see if it can overcome its operational challenges and generate massive wealth over the long term. .Looking at Lucid's stock price chart, it is clear that something went terribly wrong for the company. Shares have fallen by a whopping 96% from their all-time high of $58 (reached in early 2021), which means many early investors have been almost completely wiped out. The problem had a lot to do with macroeconomic factors outside management's control..For starters, post-pandemic inflation caused the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates, making it harder for consumers to access credit to afford Lucid's high-priced sedans (the flagship Lucid Air starts at $71,400). Furthermore, EV demand began to slow as early adopters were reached and more competition entered the market. .Even the industry leader Tesla has faced pressure, with its automotive revenue dropping by 6% in 2024 -- before Elon Musk's overt political involvement made the situation even worse in 2025..However, unlike Tesla, Lucid lacks the economies of scale to maintain profitability or keep losses under control, leading to spiraling cash burn. While first-quarter revenue grew by a respectable 36% year over year to $235 million, the company still burned through an eye-watering $692 million in just that quarter. .Lucid stays afloat through outside sources of capital, such as shareholder dilution (creating and selling more stock). But this has likely contributed to its underperformance. .Tesla's situation worsened in 2025, with first-quarter automotive sales dropping 20% year over year amid consumer boycotts and political backlash related to its CEO. This weakness could create an opportunity for Lucid to capture market share because it competes directly with Tesla's flagship Model S in the full-size luxury sedan segment. .This opportunity could be compounded by the possible passing of Trump's ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" legislation, which aims to remove the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. According to CNN, the bill's current wording might exempt small players like Lucid, giving them a tremendous edge over their larger rivals -- although this legislation is still working its way through Congress, and nothing is finalized yet.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lucid-group-millionaire-maker-stock-140000842.html

What are Tesla's competitive advantages in this space? When you explain them to clients, or what do you tell them? .Yeah, it's interesting. I've been in, I've been in Waymos and full self-driving Teslas and and, you know, the first thing that that jumped out to me was that the Tesla system felt more, more natural, right, in the process. Now, the, when you look at the Waymo system, and, you know, this is on the vehicles you see in San Francisco and other cities. Uh, or sounds like they're coming to New York at some point in the not too distant future. They have multiple redundancies in the system, right? They have cameras, they have LiDAR, they have radar and they, they because of those redundancies you know if people look at them and say there there's a higher level of safety. When you look at the, the Tesla system, you know, it's camera based and it's AI based, and they have massive quantities of data uh to do the analysis. Uh, to me the vehicles kind of felt a little more natural, but look but what we tell people is you know the lack of redundancies, the camera-based system only. There are some risks to that. Now, on the positive side, there's really three big benefits. Right, one is cost, right, if you're, if you're talking about a, a robotaxi which you're showing on the screen right now or whether we should talk about a Model Y that I that I subscribed to FSD with, you know the car can be $30 or $40,000. A a Waymo fully equipped with all the sensors, etc. is well north of a hundred thousand dollars. So cost is one. Second is uh, I think clearly the massive fleet of Teslas that are out there right now, which can become part of of a robotaxi fleet over time. But if I have a Tesla Model Y in the driveway and I have a you know full self-driving, you know theoretically I can drive that car to work and dump it into the robotaxi fleet. So the ability to scale based on a massive installed base uh is probably the second uh big positive. And, and then the third is their ability, I think, to have some flexibility whether it's uh, you know, some Tesla owned assets, assets owned by by individuals and even, even you know partnering with at some point or even using a you know me having a Tesla and dumping it into an Uber or or a Lyft fleet if I if I so choose. So there's multiple avenues for the company over time. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-vs-waymo-difference-between-120003596.html

Despite some major sell-offs in the spring, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up roughly 2% and 1%, respectively, as of this writing..While macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could inject additional rounds of volatility into the market, backing great companies for the long haul remains one of the best paths to generating strong investment returns. With some promising companies still trading at significant discounts compared to previous highs, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stand out as smart long-term investment plays right now..Lee Samaha (Tesla): Tesla stock trades down about 22% in 2025 and down about 33% from its all-time high. It hasn't been an easy year for the company or its CEO, Elon Musk, with ongoing relatively high interest rates curtailing car sales overall, and Tesla appearing to lose some ground to its rival electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. Meanwhile, Musk's political involvements have likely caused some brand damage, and the Cybertruck has proven to be a disappointment..That said, there's an odd logic to the market's reaction to these events. The investment case for Tesla has never been purely based on it as an EV manufacturer. Instead, the main value in the company lies in its potential to generate a massive stream of long-term recurring revenue from robotaxis, possibly on a ride-per-mile basis, as well as selling unsupervised, full self-driving (FSD) software. The good news is Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service, albeit on a small scale, in Austin, Texas, on June 22..Naturally, Tesla's position as the leading EV company (and manufacturer of the best-selling vehicle in the world, the Model Y, and potentially the manufacturer of a low-cost dedicated robotaxi, the Cybercab) gives it a significant advantage in a market where competitors like Ford Motor Company and General Motors have unfulfilled ambitions. Indeed, there is a reason why leading automakers and technology companies have invested billions in developing commercially viable robotaxis.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-down-34-40-111500916.html

Much of Tesla's valuation stems from its automaking business. Its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles are consistently some of the highest-selling EVs in the U.S. And with EV sales still representing less than 10% of total U.S. vehicle sales, significant growth is yet to come..But Tesla's long-term future won't be dominated by making vehicles. In fact, over the next 10 years, there's a brand new business segment that could be worth more than $1 trillion on its own..Tesla's leader, Elon Musk, has been teasing a robotaxi business for years. The pitch is simple: Any Tesla owner can essentially rent out their vehicles at any time, earning profits while they otherwise wouldn't be using the vehicle. This would make buying and owning a Tesla significantly more attractive. Businesses could be formed to buy hundreds or even thousands of Teslas for the purpose of renting them out. Tesla has also signaled plans to produce vehicles specifically for this purpose..Autonomous driving is what will unlock this new business at scale. That way, Tesla owners can put their vehicles up for rent when they're not in use via their smartphone. Then, someone looking for a ride can request a pickup, and the nearest available Tesla will automatically drive itself to the user, pick them up, drop them at the requested destination, and return itself to the original parking spot before the owner even realizes that it's gone..While details aren't available in full yet, the idea is that the vehicle owner and Tesla would split the rideshare earnings. Investor Cathie Wood sees this spawning a gigantic global robotaxi industry, potentially adding 1,000% in potential upside to Tesla's share price. ""We think $8 trillion to $10 trillion for the entire autonomous taxi opportunity throughout the world, from almost nothing,"" Wood said at an investor conference in March..Some analysts are skeptical, given Tesla's previous promises of an imminent self-driving revolution. Consider one of Musk's previous declarations. ""Our goal is, and I feel pretty good about this goal, that we'll be able to do a demonstration drive of full autonomy all the way from LA to New York, from home in LA to let's say dropping you off in Times Square in New York, and then having the car go park itself, by the end of next year. Without the need for a single touch, including the charger."" He said this way back in 2016 -- nearly a decade ago. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence make today's possibilities much more realistic, however, and Tesla's robotaxi business could arrive much sooner than everyday investors realize.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-tesla-10-years-080500340.html

For more let's welcome in our Stephen Jengaro, Stifel Next Gen transport analyst. Stephen, it's good to see you. So, Tesla's robo taxi service rolling out this weekend. There in Texas, Stephen. What what do you expect to see and hear and how excited should investors be for this moment? .Yeah, hi Josh, and thanks for having me again. So, when we think about Tesla in general, right? The robo taxi initiative and the full self-driving initiative are critical long-term value drivers of the company. We've talked a lot about that in research notes. When we think about this weekend, I mean, we think this is going to be a slow process, right? This morning you already had some senators and some some folks I think that were local, local representatives down in Texas wanting to sort of delay the launch until more safety can be checked. But, you know, this is going to be a slow process. You're probably going to see expected to see 10 or 20 vehicles on the road, Model Ys that are being very closely monitored uh by Tesla. So, this is, you know, a very slow process, but it is obviously, you know, the first step in something which can be much, much larger over time. .And in terms of how how expands from here, Stephen. Here was Dan Ives or Wedbush, we know, Dan Bull of Bulls on on Tesla, told his clients said, he said, while the Austin launch will start off small with roughly 20 Model Y vehicles, he says, it's our view Tesla will launch and scale its robo taxi service to roughly 25 cities in the US over the next year. What do you make of that? .Well, it's I think the first thing that we have to think about, Josh, is safety, right? I think one of the risks to to the launch is obviously the safety of the autonomous driving system. And, you know, if I get in an accident on the on the way to work on Monday, nobody's going to know or care. If a robo taxi, you know, bumps into a fire hydrant, it's going to be in every news feed probably in the world, right? So there has to be a really careful focus on safety. So, when we think about the next steps from here, I do think you're going to see it roll out, you know, over over the next two to three quarters in in multiple cities in the US. You know, I think it's going to be measured. I think it's going to be a slow process. I mean, when when we think about the importance of it to Tesla, I don't care that much if it's in three cities, or five cities, or seven cities, you know, by December 31st. What I care is that if there's a clean launch, it goes smoothly, and the safety record is extremely high. And I think I think Tesla understands that. So, while we do build in these significant long-term upside potentials for the company, and the robo taxi initiatives are obviously a big part of our valuation. Uh I think the near term, you know, the focus on safety is more important than how many vehicles are actually out there.

Whether you categorize TSLA as a so-called “Magnificent Seven” stock or not, its market capitalization of more than $1 trillion means that wherever it trends, so go many passive investors' portfolios..Tesla's evolution to the leading U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker initially had many investors excited.

Subscribe today!.But much of the stock's recent rise can be tied to the firm's latest ambitions around autonomous driving, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, with new lower-priced models reportedly on the horizon, investors have a plethora of potential catalysts to look to as reasons to buy and hold Tesla stock, even at a valuation that many investors may be starting to question..In fact, a number of top experts have begun to do exactly just that. Let's dive into two recent downgrades for Tesla stock and why analysts may be souring on the firm's pathway forward..Analysts from Baird and Argus Research each recently downgraded TSLA stock, citing a number of concerns that they believe investors should be pricing in. Baird put a $320 price target on Tesla, which suggests that the stock (trading above that price target currently) could be a stagnant holding at best over the course of the next year..Baird analysts Ben Kallo and Davis Sunderland noted that Tesla investors' enthusiasm over what's expected to be a high-profile robotaxi launch, as well as a future including a lower-priced EV model, may be exaggerated. Specifically, these analysts project that only around 6,000 robotaxis are likely to hit the roads by the end of next year. That's a far cry from CEO Elon Musk's previous claims..Echoing this sentiment, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky also downgraded Tesla stock to a “Hold” rating, suggesting that non-fundamental factors have been unsustainably taking TSLA stock higher. With the macro environment being what it is, and added risk around Tesla stock tied to Musk's relationship with President Donald Trump, there are plenty of reasons aside from the removal of EV tax credits why TSLA may be on shaky footing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-reasons-sell-tesla-stock-192932452.html

Tesla is slated to begin testing a dozen of what it calls robotaxis for paying customers on Sunday in a limited area of Austin, Texas..“We are formally requesting that Tesla delay autonomous robotaxi operations until the new law takes effect on September 1, 2025,” the letter from Wednesday, June 18, reads. “We believe this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public trust in Tesla's operations.”.It's not clear if the letter will have much impact. Republicans have been a dominant majority in the Texas Legislature for more than 20 years. State lawmakers and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott have generally embraced Musk and the jobs and investment he has brought to Texas, from his SpaceX rocket program on the coast, to his Tesla factory in Austin..The company, which is headquartered in Austin, did not responded immediately to a request for comment from The Associated Press..The law will require companies to secure approval from the state motor vehicles department to operate autonomous cars with passengers. That approval, in turn, would depend on sufficient proof that the cars won't pose a high risk to others if the self-driving system breaks down, among other reassurances. Companies would also have to file detailed plans for how first responders should handle the cars if there is a problem, such as an accident..The letter asked Tesla to assure the legislators it has met all the requirements of the law even if it decides to go ahead with the test run this weekend..The letter was earlier reported by Reuters..Musk has made the robotaxi program a priority at Tesla and a failure would likely be highly damaging to the company's stock, which has already tumbled 20% this year..Musk's political views and his affiliation with the Trump administration have drastically reduced sales of Tesla, particularly in Europe, where Musk’s endorsement of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party in February's election drew broad condemnation..Tesla shares bottomed out in March and have rebounded somewhat in recent months. Much of the rise reflects optimism that robotaxis will not only be deployed without a hitch, but that the service will quickly expand to other cities and eventually dominate the self-driving cab business. Rival Waymo is already picking up passengers in Austin and several other cities, and recently boasted of surpassing 10 million paid rides.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musks-robotaxi-rollout-approaches-democratic-183806948.html

After years of back-and-forth, the EV giant is opening its first showroom in Mumbai this July, followed by another in New Delhi. It's starting with the Model Yshipped straight from its Shanghai plantmarking the company's first official sales push into the world's third-largest car market. Internal documents and people familiar with the matter confirm that Tesla has also brought in Supercharger hardware, car accessories, and parts from the US, China, and the Netherlandslaying the groundwork for a broader rollout..This move follows Elon Musk's February meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and could signal the start of a long-term India strategy. But it won't be an easy ride. Each Model Y imported was declared at just under $32,000, but racked up over $25,000 in import duties due to India's 70% tariff on fully-built EVs. Final sticker price? North of $56,000 before tax and insurancenearly 50% more than the U.S. price post-incentives. For a market where EVs still make up just 5% of new car sales and luxury vehicles are under 2%, Tesla will need more than brand power to spark volume..Still, the company is quietly building momentum. It's securing warehouse space in Karnataka and Gurugram, boosting hiring across charging, retail, and policy teams, and sending execs from abroad to oversee showroom setup in luxury districts. The early signs point to a premium positioning play aimed at affluent Indian buyers. Whether that strategy holdsor pivotswill depend on how fast Tesla can shift from imports to local production.

2025-06-21 00:03:00,"Tech bull Dan Ives predicts Tesla’s robotaxi launch will catapult the company to a $2 trillion market cap, almost double its current value",Tesla is expected to launch its robotaxi program in Austin this weekend.,"Tesla’s robotaxi rollout reinforces CEO Elon Musk’s long-held belief that the future of the company will be in autonomous vehicles. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the start of the program could almost double Tesla’s market cap by the end of 2026..Tesla is on the cusp of a new era in its history, according to bullish tech investor Dan Ives..As Tesla prepares to launch the early stages of its robotaxi offering in Austin this weekend, the carmaker will make good on its long-held ambitions to enter the ride-hailing business..Ives, whose Wedbush Securities is often bullish on the tech sector, welcomed the robotaxi launch. “We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla in its history as a company,” he wrote in an analyst note released Friday..The idea that Tesla’s self-driving technology would enable it to have a fleet of robotaxis is central to the investment thesis for the company. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, has long outlined his vision of millions of self-driving Teslas shuttling around paying customers as the next phase of the company’s future. Musk has said the company’s aim is to allow Tesla owners to make their cars part of its robotaxi fleet when they aren’t using their cars..“So, kind of like Airbnb, where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guest room,” Musk said in January..The best-case scenario of the robotaxi rollout could essentially double Tesla’s market cap by the end of 2026, Ives said. He predicted that Tesla’s market cap would reach $2 trillion through next year. Tesla’s stock has had a poor year in 2025 so far, declining 15.9% year to date. The company also reported disappointing sales results earlier this year. Tesla shareholders found themselves having to contend with forces far outside their control, such as a souring relationship between the U.S. and China, its two biggest markets, and Musk’s involvement in politics and the Trump administration, which attracted significant scrutiny..Tesla did not respond to a request for comment..After the test in Austin, which will start in a geofenced location with about 25 cars, future expansions will be made easier by a favorable regulatory environment..“We fully expect under a Trump White House these key initiatives will now get fast-tracked as the federal regulatory spiderweb that Musk & Co. have encountered over the past few years around autonomous clears significantly,” Ives said..The excitement of Tesla’s most bullish investors, however, put off some others. Earlier this month, investment firm Baird downgraded Tesla’s stock from “buy” to “neutral” because it saw the rate at which the robotaxi program would expand as “a bit too optimistic.” Baird also highlighted the public tiff between Musk and Trump as raising uncertainty surrounding Tesla’s future. Argus Research cited the falling-out as the main reason for its own downgrade, which also came this month. Analysts at Argus feared Tesla’s stock was trading on “non-fundamental events,” meaning investors were buying and selling the stock for reasons that weren’t related to its financials.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-bull-dan-ives-predicts-160315177.html

Joining me now we've got Ken Johnson, who's the Eorso vice president of data analytics and AI. Great to have you here with us this morning. What are you expecting from this launch? .Thanks for having me, Brad. Uh, this launch really, in my opinion, is the bold announcement on the next phase of uh the self self self.Software defined vehicle. And what I would say there is Tesla's approach is really around data and them entering the auto taxi is just the next step for them because they have over 2 million self-driving vehicles on the roads already. So their strategy is about collecting more data, which we know for AI really drives the AI engine, and that gives them a real advantage, and one that I think will ultimately win out over uh the competition. .You know, we've heard from Elon Musk this year on earnings calls even at the beginning of the year in Q1 talking about this being a pivotal year for Tesla and specifically talking about some of the major launches that they have, especially with RoboTaxi being one of those launches and and of course it's pivot to this narrative of Tesla as an AI company.Where does this sit as a core driver for Tesla's business going forward and and how much should the thinking from the investors standpoint be changed dramatically given what they've endured for the past several years with Tesla really prioritizing automobiles. .Well, that's a great question, Brad, because we've seen Tesla stock take a bit of a hit recently, but they really have positioned themselves to be a technology company. I used to work at Microsoft and then at Ford Motor Company, and, you know, their, their, uh, charging technology is now becoming standard for both Ford and GM. That's because they had the better technology.The other OEMs are struggling with their platforms for software defined vehicles. There's a chance for Tesla to have that technology picked up as well. Technology, or Tesla is already a technology company, they're just wrapped in a, in a car company. And because of where they're going with the auto taxis, it's giving them an advantage with the data pipeline that they need to be successful in this particular space. So they're really well positioned, and, you know, I'm actually pretty excited about the future of their stock. ",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/teslas-robotaxi-rollout-kicks-off-144448552.html

The program kicks off with Tesla as the exclusive partner at Electrify Expo Los Angeles on June 21-22..“Electrify Weekender gives people the freedom to experience EVs on their own terms,” said BJ Birtwell, founder and CEO of Electrify Expo. “At our festivals, thousands of attendees get their first taste of EVs through hands-on demos, and that’s often the spark that starts their journey. With Weekender, we’re extending that experience into real life. Giving people more time behind the wheel builds confidence, and confidence drives adoption. This program is about breaking outdated myths, reaching new audiences and showing how EVs seamlessly fit into everyday life. My first EV experience was in a Tesla, so launching this with them feels like a full-circle moment. Now it’s time for others to have that same ‘light bulb’ moment.”.Tesla has been the industry leader delivering high-performance vehicles and innovative models. With Tesla’s large role in shaping the industry, the collaboration with Electrify Weekender marks another milestone in the company’s investment in EV accessibility and adoption..Attendees may sign up for the extended test drive program ahead of time or on-site at the festival. After selecting their preferred model, information is passed to the automaker who coordinates with local stores to schedule a two day driving experience..Participate in Electrify WeekenderInterested in a longer experience with an EV of your choice following your demos at Electrify Expo?

2025-06-20 22:00:00,Tesla partners with Electrify Expo to launch full-weekend EV test drives,"The 48-hour take-home program will be available to attendees of the upcoming Electrify Expo in Los Angeles, with more automakers joining soon.","Electrify Expo, which has spent the last five years putting on festivals across the U.S. to educate people about electric vehicles, is launching a demo experience where people can take an EV home for a weekend. The first company to partner up is Tesla, and Electrify Expo CEO BJ Birtwell says more brands will come on board in the near future..“It’s an opportunity for our attendees at Electrify Expo to have a no-pressure, non-sales-y experience with an electric vehicle on their terms, running errands and fitting this vehicle into their lives to see if it actually makes sense for them or not,” Birtwell told TechCrunch in an interview..Driving an electric vehicle for the first time can often convince people to make the jump from internal combustion engines. There’s also strong demand for these kinds of experiences. Late last year, Consumer Reports found that half of all consumers in the U.S. are interested in test-driving an EV..The new “Electrify Weekender” experience will be available to Electrify Expo attendees (who also need a driver’s license and auto insurance) starting with the Los Angeles festival, which begins on June 21. Birtwell said he hopes to use the Los Angeles launch as an opportunity to iron out any problems ahead of the other festivals this year in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Dallas..For Tesla, the Electrify Weekender program could be a way to reach potential customers who may still be unfamiliar with or even wary of the brand — perhaps offering a boost at a time when the company’s sales are flagging due to an aging lineup, increased competition, and the damage CEO Elon Musk has done to his company’s image. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the program..Birtwell said the Electrify Weekender program is a natural extension of the kinds of EV demos his festival has been offering for years. While those demos are brief — often lasting around 8 to 10 minutes — he said they have played an important role in converting attendees into EV buyers..“People who are buying a ticket to come to our festival are often cross-shopping a bunch of different electric cars and trucks, like they’re literally coming to our event as if we are the 2.0 version of an auto mall,” he said. “Then they’re getting into all these cars and figuring out what they want to buy. So that experience alone helps people who are really loaded low in the purchase funnel to experience to convert.”.Car companies have long offered similar extended test drive programs, but Birtwell said those often leave interested buyers feeling pressure from their local dealership to make a purchase. He expects Electrify Expo to act as an intermediary of sorts that can blunt that pressure, while also attracting consumers who may not have ever signed up for such a test drive to begin with. Ultimately, Birtwell said he expects thousands of people will take up Electrify Expo on the offer..“If we’re going to drive broader EV adoption beyond half the population, that means we need to appeal to everybody,” he said. That means especially targeting consumers who are “curious and skeptical about EVs.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-partners-electrify-expo-launch-140000493.html

Now, after 10 years its shares have soared more than 28,000%, driving the company to a valuation above $3.5 trillion. Nvidia is also closing in on new record highs as it is just 5% shy of the record $153.13 set early in January..The company that designs and sells advanced chips and software platforms — primarily for AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous systems – counts tech majors such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and nearly every major AI and cloud company as its customer..From hyperscalers to sovereign AI, Nvidia is becoming more and more irreplaceable.

And the next evolution of the Nvidia Blackwell AI factory platform, Blackwell Ultra, will be coming to systems in the second half of this year.”.Further bolstering its dominance in the GPU industry, where it already commands a near-monopoly with a-greater-than-90% market share, Nvidia has outlined a compelling product roadmap that is expected to reinforce its leadership position even more firmly.

The technology has clear advantages and important limitations..Here are some details of how it works:.WHAT IS TELEOPERATION?.Teleoperation is the control of machines by humans in a different location, usually over a wireless network..It is used to train robots to operate autonomously, monitor their autonomous activity, and take over when required..HOW DO ROBOTAXI OPERATORS USE TELEOPERATION?.The global robotaxi industry is still in test mode, as companies deploy the vehicles in limited geographic areas and continually adjust the artificial intelligence software that controls them. Teleoperation is often used to intervene when a vehicle is unsure of what to do..Alphabet's Waymo, for example, has a team of human ""fleet response"" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver - its bot..""Much like phone-a-friend, when the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information,"" Waymo said in a blog post last year..Former Waymo CEO John Krafcik told Reuters, ""the cars aren't being actively monitored,"" adding that the software is ""the ultimate decision-maker."".A Waymo video shows a car asking a remote operator whether a street with emergency response vehicles is open to traffic. When the human says yes, the vehicle proceeds..In contrast, other companies, such as Baidu's Apollo Go in China, have used fully remote backup drivers who can step in to virtually drive the vehicles. Baidu declined to comment..WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS?.Driving vehicles remotely on public roads has a major potential problem: it relies on cellular data connections that can drop or operate with a lag, disconnecting the vehicle from the remote driver in dangerous situations.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-tesla-expected-remotely-control-102154515.html

A coalition of ten French Tesla owners is suing the American EV giant, challenging Elon Musk’s prior political affiliations and support for far-right causes in Europe. The automaker faced a sharp decline in sales across Europe following Musk’s alignment with Germany’s AfD party and inflammatory comments regarding the nation’s Nazi-era history..Sales of Tesla vehicles in France plummeted 67% in May 2025 year-over-year, as reported by the PFA. The backlash has manifested not only in boycotts but also in physical attacks on Tesla infrastructure and customer property. Several clients of Ivan Terel, a partner at the Paris law firm GKA, were among the victims of vehicle vandalism. One reported a swastika painted on their car, and another said it had been defiled with feces..Copyright: wolandmaster / 123RF Stock Photo.GKA brought the case before the Paris Commercial Court on June 11, demanding that the leases be voided and their clients compensated for the purchase costs and other related damages. Terel explained that the case is grounded in a French civil code article requiring sellers to “guarantee buyers the undisturbed use of purchased goods,” emphasizing that the statute, though old, is being cited in a unique situation involving Musk’s former White House ties..The commercial court will evaluate whether the case holds legal merit and if others may be added to the claim in the meantime. Since GKA filed the lawsuit, Terel mentioned that several Tesla owners have reached out to learn more..While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

After all, its CEO, Elon Musk, is the world's richest man, due in large part to his 13% stake in the company.","Elon Musk is turning into a liability for Tesla. But the company would struggle without his hype and energy..The stock's valuation looks high, even in the best-case scenario..These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›.Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has already created plenty of millionaires. After all, its CEO, Elon Musk, is the world's richest man, due in large part to his 13% stake in the company. But past performance doesn't guarantee future success. It's unclear if Tesla still has what it takes to continue its bull run, especially as political pressure and electric vehicle (EV) industry weakness bite. .Let's dig deeper to decide if Tesla's pivot to new opportunities, like robotics and self-driving technology, could help it overcome its weaknesses in its legacy automotive operations and its uncomfortably high valuation..Cars have been around for over 100 years, which means the industry is incredibly mature, leading to low margins and stiff competition. For a time, Tesla had been able to buck these dynamics through high levels of vertical integration, economies of scale, and innovations like giga casting, which replaced complex assembled parts with large single-piece structures. But over time, the company's economic moat has eroded. .The main challenge has been competition from low-cost Chinese EV rivals like BYD and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors, which have leveraged their massive production infrastructure and dealership networks to scale rapidly. However, Musk certainly hasn't made things easier through his foray into U.S. politics, with his outspoken support for President Donald Trump. Taking a strong political position on one side or the other will inevitably rub a large portion of potenital buyers the wrong way..Tesla's first-quarter earnings demonstrate its deteriorating brand appeal. Revenue dropped 9% year over year to $21.3 billion, driven by a 20% collapse in the automotive segment, which represents 82% of sales..The collapse was worst in Europe. Sales on the continent slumped by a stunning 37.2%. The good news is that Tesla's U.S. operations have held up much better -- for now. .So far, many American consumers appear to be keeping their politics separate from their car-buying decisions. U.S. first-quarter sales were down by a relatively modest 9%, according to data from Cox Automotive. However, it's unclear how much longer Tesla's honeymoon period will last.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-millionaire-maker-stock-071400655.html

What Happened: The Federal ...","Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below..Economist Peter Schiff issued warnings about America’s economic trajectory during Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, predicting the central bank’s decade-long policies will trigger an unavoidable crisis worse than 2008..What Happened: The Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.50% for the fourth consecutive meeting, while projecting two rate cuts in 2025. However, Schiff told Fox Business that Fed Chair Jerome Powell “basically admitted that they have no idea what’s going to happen.”.Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today..The Fed’s updated projections show Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation rising to 3.0% in 2025, up from March’s 2.7% forecast, while real GDP growth was downgraded to 1.4% from 1.7%. Unemployment is expected to reach 4.5% in 2025..Schiff argued these forecasts dramatically underestimate the severity of coming problems. “All of the inflation chickens that the Fed has been releasing for more than a decade are coming home to roost,” he said, attributing inflation pressures to years of artificially low rates rather than tariffs..The economist predicted stagflation, combining recession with “much higher inflation happening at the same time,” potentially escalating to hyperinflation. He warned of a “global exodus out of U.S. stocks, out of U.S. bonds” as foreign investors retreat from American assets..See Also: Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential.

Nobel laureate Paul Krugman recently warned of an “emerging-market-type crisis” featuring sudden capital flight, housing crashes, and dollar devaluation..Concerns about America’s fiscal sustainability are mounting across Wall Street. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk recently warned the U.S. faces “de facto bankruptcy” as federal debt surpasses $37 trillion, with interest payments consuming 25% of tax revenue. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has warned of potential bond market disruption..The economist insisted that lower rates won’t solve America’s problems because cheap money caused them. “The solution involves much higher interest rates,” Schiff said, acknowledging this would trigger widespread bankruptcies, defaults, and “a protracted recession, probably a much worse financial crisis than 2008.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peter-schiff-predicts-worse-financial-033054809.html

The billionaire tycoon has also engaged in a feud with Sam Altman..Musk is the owner of the automotive and clean energy company Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), social media platform X, and space technology company SpaceX, making him the wealthiest man in the world. Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, the AI company behind the popular ChatGPT bot..Both the entrepreneurs have hailed cryptocurrencies..Musk's Tesla holds more than $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet, and the tycoon has often talked about Dogecoin in positive terms. In fact, the acronym of the department he led in Washington, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is the same as the ticker of the popular meme coin..Altman is also a fan of cryptocurrencies. In October 2023, he praised Bitcoin in an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast:.“I think this idea that we have a global currency that is outside of the control of any government is a super logical and important step on the tech tree.“.Altman even launched the Worldcoin cryptocurrency in 2019..Both Musk and Altman are also among the OpenAI co-founders. Musk even served on its board of directors from its launch in December 2015 until his resignation in 2018. Musk, who also runs an AI company, xAI, has frequently criticized OpenAI’s shift from a non-profit to a “capped-profit” model under Altman's leadership..As the so-called ""The OpenAI Files"" came out on X, Musk blasted the ChatGPT chief as ""Scam Altman."".AI models such as OpenAI have been criticized for their centralized models, with decentralized AI, supported by crypto payments, being touted as a possible challenger to the hegemony of the likes of OpenAI..The AI tokens market cap stood at $25 billion at the time of writing..Elon Musk calls OpenAI founder 'Scam Altman' first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 19, 2025.This story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 19, 2025, where it first appeared.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-two-harsh-words-203717177.html

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other popular names sit at the heart of this quarterly triple witching event, where index options, single-stock options, and ETF contracts all expire at once. While the expiry itself may not trigger a sharp move on the day, the aftermath could look very different. Rocky Fishman, founder of Asym 500, called this one among the largest ever and flagged the potential for markets to finally break free from the tight range theyve traded in since May..Whats held stocks in check? According to Fishman, a wave of defensive trades earlier this year effectively pinned the S&P 500 around current levels. During Aprils tariff-fueled volatility, many investors bought downside protection while selling upside calls near 6,000 betting the index wouldnt get that high. As those trades expire, that ceiling could lift. Its all tied to how dealers hedge. When markets are in a positive gamma regime, as they are now, dealers tend to smooth volatilitybuying when stocks drop and selling into rallies. But once those positions expire, that cushion may disappear..Some strategists are watching closely. Matthew Thompson at Little Harbor Advisors sees these expiry windows as chances to make volatility plays in his ETF strategies. Citigroup analysts Vishal Vivek and Stuart Kaiser note that triple-witching days usually arent much more volatile than regular monthly expiriesbut this one stands out due to sheer size. Citi estimates $5.8 trillion in contracts are expiring, while Fishman includes additional index futures options to arrive at $6.5 trillion.

CEO Linda Yaccarino told the Financial Times that users will soon be able to invest or trade directly on the apppart of Elon Musk's grander vision to turn X into a U.S. version of China's WeChat. That includes everything from peer-to-peer payments via X Money to digital tipping and possibly even credit or debit cards, which could arrive as early as this year. The rollout will begin in the U.S., with Visa onboard as a launch partner, before expanding to other markets..The move comes as X tries to climb out of its post-acquisition slump. Since Musk's $44 billion takeover, advertising revenue has dropped sharply, and the platform has battled both reputational damage and advertiser boycotts. Yaccarino says 96% of pre-acquisition advertisers have returned and expects revenue to rebound to 2022 levels super soon. But not everyone's convinced. Some advertisers remain wary, citing concerns over brand safety, content toxicity, and reports of pressure to spend or face legal action. Research firm Emarketer sees X's 2025 revenue reaching $2.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion last yearbut still far below the $4.1 billion it generated when Musk first took the reins..There's also a tech twist. In March, Musk folded X into his AI startup xAI in a $45 billion deal. Yaccarino believes this will double the engineering horsepower behind the platform and help deliver smarter, real-time ad targeting around trending content. While X may face serious regulatory friction as it pushes into payments and investing, the potential upside is significant. If it works, X could carve out a unique lane that blends trading, tipping, and transacting in one appterritory even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) hasn't touched..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-just-turned-x-184824963.html

Sometimes she chases stocks at high prices, believing their long-term potential outweighs short-term volatility..This is what she just did, adding shares of a popular AI stock nearing an all-time high on June 16..Wood’s funds have experienced a volatile ride this year, swinging from strong gains to sharp losses and now back to outperforming the broader market..In January and February, the Ark funds rallied as investors bet on the Trump administration's potential deregulation that could benefit Wood’s tech bets. But the momentum faded in March and April, with the funds trailing the market as top holdings—especially Tesla, her biggest position  —slid amid growing concerns over the macroeconomy and trade policies..Related: Veteran analyst unveils bold price target for Tempus AI stock.Now, the fund is regaining momentum.

Her strategy can lead to sharp gains during bull markets, but also painful losses, like in 2022 when ARKK dropped more than 60%..As of June 17, Ark Innovation ETF, with $5.5 billion under management, has delivered a five-year annualized return of negative 0.3%. The S&P 500 has an annualized return of 15.7% over the same period..Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics..Wood says these companies have the potential to reshape industries, but their volatility leads to major fluctuations in Ark funds' values..Related: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income.The Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth over the 10 years ending in 2024, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking..Wood recently said the U.S. is coming out of a three-year “rolling recession” and heading into a productivity-led recovery that could trigger a broader bull market..In a letter to investors published in late April, she dismissed predictions of a recession dragging into 2026, as she expects ""more clarity on tariffs, taxes, regulations, and interest rates over the next three to six months.""",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-buys-18-5-184700412.html

After a slow start, the Chinese EV giant has roared to life, nearly quadrupling sales in just four months and overtaking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in European EV volumes. Its formula? A relentless push downmarket with lower-priced, feature-packed models like the Dolphin Surf, a 23,000 hatchback that launched under a drone-lit sky in Rome. Armed with a 20 billion war chest, BYD is investing heavily across the continent, building its own factory in Hungary, and signing on high-profile European execs to drive expansion. Sales are up more than 200% year-on-year in Europe's five largest auto markets and in the UK alone, BYD's units jumped from 1,600 to nearly 12,000 in a year..The company's success isn't accidental it's strategic. BYD dumped its premium-only strategy, took control of its import ops, and began flooding showrooms with budget EVs and plug-in hybrids. It now controls everything from battery cells to delivery logistics, giving it speed and pricing power most rivals can't match. Former Stellantis executives are leading the charge in Germany, Spain, and Italy, while the Hungary factory is prepping to ship the Seal U SUV across the region by year-end. Meanwhile, brands like Renault, Fiat, and Mini are getting squeezed. BYD's base trims undercut the competition by thousands of euros while offering extras adaptive cruise, 360 cameras, head-up displays that legacy brands often hide behind pricey packages..Still, it's not all upside. Margins are thin, brand loyalty is weak, and regulators are starting to question the role of hybrids a big part of BYD's volume. Despite the splashy sponsorships and showroom blitzes, it's a fragile lead. The company is spending like it already owns the market, but if sales slow, the financial strain could hit fast.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 5 cents per share.Quarterly revenues plunged 37.6% year over year to $19.3 million, mostly attributable to lower revenues from Slacker Radio, which has been transforming its business model. The consensus mark was pegged at $25 million.Despite the top-line compression, the company exceeded its full-year revenue guidance by $2.4 million. For fiscal 2025, LVO reported revenues of $114.4 million, a 3.4% decrease.Its total user base, including subscribers and ad-supported users, crossed 1.45 million, reflecting solid audience engagement and growth.

Also, the company’s operational reset is in traction, with major cost initiatives already showing positive impacts.The Audio business, comprising Slacker Radio and PodcastOne, has achieved record revenues of $108.9 million for fiscal 2025, surpassing guidance by $2.9 million. Additionally, the division delivered a record adjusted EBITDA of $18.2 million, exceeding expectations by more than 51%.In response to both top and bottom-line contraction, LVO’s shares sank 11% in trading and closed the session at 77 cents on June 18, 2025.

The breakdown of adjusted EBITDA reveals a healthy $4.1 million contribution from the Audio Division, which benefited from both improved contribution margins and decreased operating costs. This growth helped offset the EBITDA loss of $1 million from Other Operations and $1.5 million from Corporate.LiveOne posted an operating loss of $8.2 million for the quarter, significantly wider than $1.2 million reported a year ago. This deterioration was mostly due to the revenue decrease, though it was partially offset by cuts in various operating expenses.A key aspect of LiveOne’s long-term strategy is its commitment to product development.

The software and chip company has been riding the AI wave as companies like Alphabet and Meta place orders for its custom AI chips..The tech giant’s stock doubled in each of the past two years, climbing more than 350% from the start of 2023 to yesterday’s close. With a $1.2 trillion market cap, Broadcom is the S&P 500’s seventh-most-valuable company, worth more than either Walmart or Berkshire Hathaway..Broadcom’s skyrocketing value has some Wall Streeters wondering whether it’s time for a shakeup of the Magnificent Seven, which currently includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla..READ ALSO: Novo Nordisk Backs Away From Hims & Hers Partnership and Fiserv Connecting Thousands of Banks to Crypto with New Stablecoin Platform.Analysts expect Broadcom’s sales to soar 22% this fiscal year and 21% in 2026. Broadcom reported earnings earlier this month that topped analysts’ estimates after raking in $15 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter..Nvidia is the only company in the Magnificent Seven whose sales growth surpasses Broadcom’s. In contrast, Tesla’s revenue has contracted 1% this year, and its shares have tanked. The automaker’s market cap is just above the $1 trillion mark. Four of the companies in the Magnificent Seven have seen their shares fall this year..Meanwhile, Broadcom’s business is booming, especially its AI arm:.Broadcom has a sprawling empire of technology that ranges from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips to cybersecurity software, but its custom AI chips now make up nearly a third of its revenue..The tech company made $4.4 billion of its revenue from AI in the second quarter (a 60% annual uptick) and expects $5.1 billion next quarter as cloud providers like Alphabet place more orders. The company predicts AI growth will continue next year..Name Games: The Magnificent Seven is a way of grouping together some of the S&P 500’s most influential companies, similar to its predecessor FAANG (made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google before Facebook and Google changed their names). But some experts say the purpose of these groupings is to track trends, not just the most valuable companies. If the trend investors are eyeing now is AI, then swapping Tesla out for Broadcom may not make sense since Tesla is also leveraging AI (for robotaxis and humanoid robots).

This time, however, it wasn't because the ChatGPT developer released another groundbreaking product aimed at its rivals..Rather, investors learned that OpenAI is teaming up with ... Alphabet. Below, I'm going to detail why the partnership between OpenAI and Alphabet is such a big deal..Moreover, I'll break down which AI data center stock I think is poised to benefit most from this deal. Let's dig in..You may recall that when OpenAI emerged a few years ago, Microsoft was fast to partner with the company. More specifically, Microsoft plowed $10 billion into OpenAI as part of a strategic investment. One of the cornerstones of this deal was integrating ChatGPT into Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure. Throughout their partnership, OpenAI's compute infrastructure for training and inferencing was primarily supported by Microsoft. With Google entering the picture, however, those dynamics have changed..OpenAI is branching out beyond Microsoft and now leveraging the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to complement Azure for compute resources. While this is a huge win for Alphabet's cloud business -- which rivals both Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- I see an even bigger winner emerging from this partnership..While Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have been critical sources of high-performance chipsets for data centers throughout the AI revolution, a new player is emerging as a key resource in the space..CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) provides critical infrastructure services to AI developers through a cloud-based model. Companies that may not have the time or financial resources to acquire graphics processing units (GPU) from Nvidia and its peers can essentially rent them from CoreWeave's cloud-based infrastructure.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monster-artificial-intelligence-ai-data-010000853.html

On the surface, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence..However, over the last couple of weeks, Tesla stock has started to witness some new life -- save for a brief sell-off following a fleeting tiff between Elon Musk and President Trump..While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback during the second half of the year..Let's explore a major update coming to Tesla soon and understand how this could fuel shares to new all-time highs. Is now the time to pounce on Tesla stock? Read on to find out..Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs. Rather, Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla..Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software. Tesla plans to leverage self-driving software across two applications: offering it as a feature in its cars and building a fleet of robotaxis for ride-hailing services..While the initial launch date for the Tesla Robotaxi was rumored to be June 12, more recent commentary from Musk himself suggests that the first rides will take place in Austin, Texas, later this month (potentially between June 22 and 28)..A successful robotaxi launch represents a transformative shift in Tesla -- from primarily a car manufacturer to more of an AI-powered services provider disrupting ride-hailing, car rentals, or logistics businesses..When it comes to popular stocks in the AI realm, I'm sure cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon come to mind. Moreover, given Nvidia's ongoing rollout of its new Blackwell GPU architecture, the semiconductor king appears well positioned for further growth, too..Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AI capital expenditures (capex) just this year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-220000899.html

The company announced Wednesday that it has applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation for its vehicles to operate autonomously with a “trained specialist” behind the wheel in Manhattan..Waymo says it does plan to eventually introduce a self-driving service for paid rides in New York City, even if the company doesn’t have a time frame for bringing it to the streets of the nation’s largest and most traffic-ridden city. It called the test “an important step towards one day serving New Yorkers.”.Waymo last deployed its cars in New York in 2021. But that was only a test for data collection and weather testing while a human actually drove the vehicle, the company said..This year’s deployment in the nation’s most congested city will still be a test, but “if the permit is granted, (Waymo) would be (New York City)’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles,” the company said..Shares of Lyft (LYFT) and Uber (UBER) both fell following the announcement..Waymo already provides more than 250,000 paid rides a week without a human driver in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. But it is illegal in New York state to operate a car without a person ready to take control of the vehicle to avoid an accident. Waymo also announced it will begin pushing for a change to that state law. And any company offering a self-driving system officially requires approval from New York City, human driver or not..Waymo has partnered with Uber to provide the service in Phoenix and Austin, and is operating robotaxis itself in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It plans to soon be in Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC. In addition, Tesla has announced plans to start its own “robotaxi” service in Austin this Sunday, with plans to expand to other cities in the “coming months.” Tesla, however has been promising its widespread robotaxi service was only “a year away” since 2019..Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk insists that providing robotaxi services will produce massive profits and an increased share price for his company. But profitable self-driving car services have thus far remained elusive for other providers..Alphabet does not disclose the financial performance of Waymo. But the segment of the company that includes Waymo reported a $4.1 billion loss last year, even as Alphabet poured in $5.6 billion. That loss is little more than a rounding error for a company that reported net income of $100 billion in 2024.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-returning-nyc-still-needs-182338571.html
2025-06-19 01:55:00,War Premiums Explode: Oil Tankers Face 60% Surge to Cross World's Most Dangerous Waterway,Strait of Hormuz turns into an insurance hotspot as geopolitical tensions threaten to choke global energy flows,"Insurance costs are rising fast for oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuzone of the world's most critical energy chokepoints. According to Marsh McLennan, war risk premiums for hull and machinery insurance have jumped from 0.125% to roughly 0.2% of ship value since the Israel-Iran conflict escalated. For a $100 million vessel, that's a jump from $125,000 to $200,000. The higher price reflects rising concern among underwriters that a broader regional escalationor even a single high-profile incidentcould disrupt the already fragile Gulf shipping lanes..Shipowners aren't just facing abstract risks. This week, two tankers collided near the Strait, with at least one vessel reportedly transmitting erratic signals, fueling speculation about potential electronic interference. Meanwhile, insurers are increasingly uneasy that Houthi forces may expand their attack scope beyond just U.S., U.K., or Israeli-affiliated vessels. Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo at Marsh, said that while no missiles have hit ships in the Gulf so far, the industry is pricing in a far more volatile backdrop. With the war insurance market on edge, rates could rise further in the weeks ahead..Some insurers may pull back entirely. Others might lean in, betting on outsized gains in a high-risk, high-reward environment. War itself, as an insurance product, tends to be either you lose everything or make a fortune, Baker noted. That dynamicuncertainty mixed with profit potentialis exactly what keeps investors alert. For companies exposed to shipping or energy, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which relies on stable supply chains, risks in the Strait could become a meaningful cost variable. As the conflict simmers, the market is recalibrating what it costs to move oil through one of the most strategically sensitive stretches of water on the planet..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/war-premiums-explode-oil-tankers-175528373.html

During an interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast, she said that if she could only invest in one stock, it would be Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which is one of Ark's longest-standing positions and the top holding across all of its ETFs..Let's dig into why Tesla has earned so much confidence from Wood. From there, I'll dig into how Tesla is disrupting several pockets of the AI realm and assess the company's valuation to help determine if the stock is a good buy right now..During the interview, Wood described Tesla as a ""convergence"" across three arenas that Ark targets across its investments: robotics, energy storage, and AI..For much of its history, Tesla focused on two core segments: electric vehicles and energy storage. While these two opportunities remain enormous, AI is the pillar supporting its growth narrative..The first layer of Tesla's AI ambitions involves autonomous driving technology, which the company could market to both businesses and consumers. For example, self-driving functionality would be a big value-adding amenity for buyers of  Teslas, which could help it maintain its differentiation in a crowded and commoditized automobile market..The more lucrative opportunity when it comes to autonomous vehicles is connected to Tesla's plan to build a fleet of robotaxis. That could potentially send shock waves across markets from ride-hailing to car rentals to delivery services..Wood is particularly bullish on Tesla's robotaxi project. During her interview, she clarified that Ark's $2,600 five-year price target on Tesla stock doesn't even account for the company's potential successes in other areas of AI that it's focusing on, such as robotics.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-says-she-could-171900158.html

Zoox would need an exemption from US auto safety rules that require vehicles to have driver controls, though the Trump administration has said it’s working on changes to provide those approvals faster..Zoox is “very grateful” to the administration’s work in preparing the US for robotaxis and talks with regulatory bodies are “going well”, Evans said..Zoox is testing or operating robotaxis on a limited basis in San Fransisco and Las Vegas, where it plans to launch its service. Waymo, which uses vehicles made by other automakers that it rigs with self-driving software and sensors, is seen as the market leader and charges fares for rides in multiple US markets..To start, Zoox has a dozen of its robotaxis driving on the Las Vegas Strip, Evans said.

MOIA said its AD MaaS software uses AI to manage fleets in real time and integrates into existing booking apps..In addition, the system meets key regulatory requirements for SAE Level 4 automated vehicles, MOIA said, using additional features like remote supervision and safe handling of emergency interventions on the streets..MOIA’s all-in-one offering — car, self-driving software, and robotaxi platform — comes as Tesla (TSLA) prepares to begin its robotaxi test in Austin in a few days..“Beginning in 2026, we will bring sustainable, autonomous mobility to large-scale deployment in Europe and the US, another milestone on our path to becoming a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen Group CEO, in a statement..VW claims the “MOIA Turnkey Solution” can be implemented by large commercial fleet operators, and the ID. Buzz AD will be deployed on Uber's platform starting next year in Los Angeles..VW believes the ID. Buzz is a strong choice for robotaxi use. It features an extended wheelbase and raised roof for added space, sliding electric doors for ease of entry, four separate seats, and storage space both up front and in the rear..“The ID.

The electric vehicle giant is just days away from launching its autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, and the stakes couldn't be higher. Traders are bracing for turbulence. After a 3.9% slide on Tuesday, the stock has been bouncing around as the countdown begins. Whether the launch goes off smoothlyor runs into app bugs, protests, or worsecould shape Tesla's near-term price action..For those with a shorter time horizon, it's a textbook profit-taking setup. Tesla has already surged 33% since its April 22 earnings, and Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco, who holds the stock in the Technology Innovators Portfolio, thinks traders might want to lock in gains before any post-launch noise hits. But longer-term investors are watching for something bigger. People are starting to price in robotaxi, Rocco said. The thesis? Tesla has been quietly laying the groundwork for scalemost Model 3 and Model Y cars sold in recent years could become robotaxis with software updates. That gives Tesla a shot at catching up to Waymo, which currently handles over 250,000 autonomous rides weekly using just 1,500 vehicles..Still, this isn't a done deal. Bulls are betting the launch will validate Tesla's AI strategy and unlock a high-margin business model built on autonomous networks. Bears, on the other hand, aren't buying the hypenot yet.

That's on top of $5 billion in debt reportedly backed by Morgan Stanley to fund its AI infrastructure buildout. This is Musk's most expensive bet yet, and it's running hot before revenues have caught up..The gap between ambition and monetization is sharp. While peers like OpenAI are on track to pull in $12.7 billion this year, xAI is only expecting $500 millionpossibly climbing to over $2 billion in 2026. The company believes its control over chips, infrastructure, and data via X offers a structural advantage, helping it bypass some of the costly leasing and dataset expenses other AI players face. That pitch has helped push its valuation to $80 billion in Q1 2025, up from $51 billion at the end of 2024. Backers include heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, and VY Capitalbut even they have reportedly asked for more detailed financials as fundraising dragged..Despite the steep burn, xAI is projecting profitability by 2027, faster than OpenAI's 2029 target. Investors have been told the company secured a $650 million rebate from one supplier and is tweaking deal terms to ease market concerns. But the path ahead looks volatile.

2025-06-18 22:40:00,Will Higher Production Volumes of R2 Boost Rivian's Gross Profit?,RIVN hits record gross profit and eyes margin gains from higher R2 output as it gears up for 2026 launch.,"Rivian Automotive, Inc. RIVN reported a gross profit of $206 million in the first quarter of 2025, marking its second consecutive quarter of positive gross profit and its highest gross margin to date. This milestone reflects the company’s ongoing efforts to enhance cost efficiency across its operations. Rivian had recorded a gross loss of $527 million in the first quarter of 2024 while it posted gross profit of $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by reductions in variable costs, increased revenue per vehicle delivered and improved management of fixed costs.With record gross profit, Rivian has also met the gross profit milestone with Volkswagen Group following the formation of their joint venture, Rivian and VW Group Technology, LLC and expects to receive $1 billion in funding by the end of June.The company maintains its outlook of delivering a modest positive gross profit for the full year 2025. Looking ahead, Rivian anticipates a quicker path to profitability with the upcoming launch of R2 in the first half of 2026. The expected higher production volumes of R2 at the Normal facility are projected to reduce fixed costs per unit across all vehicles produced at the plant, boosting margins. Rivian carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..Tesla TSLA posted a gross profit of $3.15 billion in the first quarter of 2025, which fell from the gross profit of $3.7 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter.

Despite reporting a gross loss, Lucid delivered a significant improvement in gross margin. On a GAAP basis, Lucid posted a first-quarter gross margin of negative 97.2%, an improvement from negative 134.3% in the same quarter last year. This progress was due to increased revenue from regulatory credits, ongoing cost-reduction efforts and disciplined operational execution..Rivian has outperformed the Zacks Automotive-Domestic industry year-to-date.

The stock has declined about 22% so far this year..According to Business Insider, Tesla plans to suspend manufacturing of its Cybertruck and Model Y models for a week starting June 30. The company reportedly told employees the downtime would allow for maintenance and upgrades on the production lines. No details were provided on which areas may see output improvements..This marks at least the third production pause for Tesla in 2025. The EV maker has been under pressure following disappointing first-quarter results and increasing competition in the global electric vehicle market. Investor concerns have also been fueled by CEO Elon Musk's political ties and recent public disputes..Meanwhile, Tesla is preparing to roll out a pilot version of its Robotaxi service in Austin on June 22. The initiative will use Model Y vehicles equipped with the company's latest Full Self-Driving software. Local groups have voiced opposition to the program, citing safety and transparency concerns..Separately, Wells Fargo issued a downbeat outlook on Tesla's second-quarter performance. Analyst Colin Langan warned that deliveries would need to jump over 50% in June to meet Wall Street targets. He also forecast a $1.9 billion free cash flow deficit for the year and slashed his price target to $120, reflecting a possible 62% downside..Based on the one year price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average target price for Tesla Inc is $289.30 with a high estimate of $500.00 and a low estimate of $19.05.

Employees were reportedly offered paid time off or training opportunities during the pause, which Tesla says will allow for ""maintenance and improvements."".The move comes as Tesla continues to deal with slower demand and rising inventory levels.

However, recent estimates suggest Q2 deliveries could be down as much as 20% from the prior year, raising questions about the health of demand despite elevated production capacity..The company has been operating most of its global factories at about 60% utilization since 2024, citing persistent inventory buildup and uneven market conditions..This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tsla-halt-gigafactory-texas-120508210.html

But even before the money is in the bank, the company has plans to spend more than half of it in just the next three months, the people said..Over the course of 2025, xAI, which is responsible for the AI-powered chatbot Grok, expects to burn through about $13 billion, as reflected in the company’s levered cash flow, according to details shared with investors. As a result, its prolific fundraising efforts are just barely keeping pace with expenses, the people added..A spokesperson for the company declined to comment. However, Musk said “Bloomberg is talking nonsense” in a response to a post on his social media platform X that referenced Bloomberg’s article..The losses are due, in part, to the huge costs that all AI companies face as they build the server farms and buy the specialized computer chips that are needed to train advanced AI models like Grok and ChatGPT. Carlyle Group Inc. estimates that over $1.8 trillion of capital will be deployed by 2030 to meet that demand to build out AI infrastructure, Chief Executive Officer Harvey Schwartz wrote in a shareholder letter..“Model builders will look to raise debt and they’re going to burn lots and lots of cash,” said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst and head of technology at CreditSights. “The space is very competitive and they are battling for technical supremacy.”.But Musk’s entrant in the AI race has struggled to develop revenue streams at the same rate as some of its direct competitors, like OpenAI and Anthropic..While almost none of these companies offer public figures on their finances, Bloomberg has previously reported that OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is expecting to bring in revenues of $12.7 billion this year. At xAI, revenues are expected to be just $500 million this year, rising to north of $2 billion next year, investors were recently told.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-xai-burns-1-billion-185314873.html

The researcher now sees the country trailing not only China and Europe, but also the global average adoption rate until 2040..“Global EV sales are growing, but the national picture is more varied than ever,” BNEF analysts write in the report released Wednesday. Whereas China is expected to account for nearly two-thirds of the almost 22 million plug-in vehicles sold globally this year, in part thanks to government incentives, “all major EV policies in the US are under fire.”.Trump ordered the elimination of subsidies and other measures boosting electric vehicles during his first day back in the White House in January. His administration and the Republican-controlled Congress are heeding his directive by moving to ease national fuel-economy standards, phase out EV tax credits and strip California’s ability to set its own emissions limits..BNEF’s outlook assumes national gas-mileage and tailpipe regulations will revert back to where they were during Trump’s first term, and that the up-to-$7,500 consumer tax credit will end for most EVs after this year. There’s potential for further downside to the researcher’s outlook for EV sales in the US, depending on the ultimate fate of waivers allowing states to impose more stringent clean-air rules. A coalition of states led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta sued last week to challenge the administration’s move to scrap state-level policies..“If this attempt at revoking the waiver is successful, it would have dire consequences for EV sales in California, and because of the state’s oversized influence on the EV market in the country, in whole of the US,” BNEF says. “Removing all of the supply-side mandates in the country, at the same time as demand incentives, would push down EV sales in the US sharply.”.China, by contrast, is expected to keep up its momentum in transitioning to plug-in vehicles, largely due to simple economics: It’s the only large market where EVs are cheaper, on average, than comparable combustion cars. Demand also is getting a boost from the government extending subsidies that encourage consumers to trade in older cars for new EVs and hybrids.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-turning-us-electric-vehicle-070038005.html

When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of £82m..Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly £136bn..Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L)..While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes ""cash shell"" Langbar International, which claimed to have £370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent..Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal..Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the ""Wild West"", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE)..Read more: Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters.In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed £68bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs..Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing £12.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market — either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%..“AIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,"" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L).

In addition to Tesla, the Kia EV6 and the Volkswagen ID.4 took the 6th and 10th spots, respectively..The annual index ranks current model-year vehicles using five major factors, including the location of final assembly, percentage of U.S. and Canadian parts, countries of origin for all available engines, countries of origin for all available transmissions, and U.S. manufacturing workforce. Some 400 vehicles from the 2025 model year were studied to arrive at the 99 vehicles on the 2025 American-Made Index, according to Cars.com. Heavy-duty vehicles like the Tesla Cybertruck and the Rivian R1S, both of which are made in the U.S., don’t qualify..The Kia EV6, which is assembled at the Korean automaker’s West Point, Georgia factory, took another eyebrow-raising prize. The Kia EV6 contains 80% U.S. and Canadian parts, the highest percentage of any vehicle sold in America today. Cars.com noted that only eight EVs qualified for the 2024 index. This year, 11 battery-electric vehicles made it on the AMI, including the Ford F-150 Lightning, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, and the Kia EV9 SUV. And another 19 are hybrids and plug-in hybrids. The stats demonstrate “the industry’s push for electrification wasn’t mere lip service,” according to Cars.com..The question is whether tariffs, higher prices, and the end of the federal EV tax credits (which the Senate has proposed in its tax and budget bill) will derail this electric trajectory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/evs-dominate-most-american-made-205717802.html

CFO Vaibhav Taneja highlighted that simultaneously updating all factories for the Model Y was “not a small feat,” resulting in several weeks of lost production and delayed availability of the updated vehicle in key markets. Additionally, Taneja cited the negative impact of “vandalism and unwanted hostility” toward Tesla’s brand in certain regions, and explained that auto margins declined due to lower deliveries and fixed cost absorption. Despite these challenges, Tesla’s energy storage segment achieved a record gross profit, and management pointed to continued investments in AI and new vehicle programs as positioning the company for long-term growth..Is now the time to buy TSLA?

Those are unscripted and can often highlight topics that management teams would rather avoid or topics where the answer is complicated. Here is what has caught our attention..Pierre Ferragu (New Street Research) asked why Model 3 and Model Y have not gained higher market share, despite their competitive advantages. CEO Elon Musk responded that in the near future, most people may not buy cars at all, as autonomous transportation becomes more prevalent..Emmanuel Rosner (Wolfe Research) questioned what is still required for Full Self-Driving (FSD) to reach true unsupervised autonomy. Management explained they are addressing rare intervention cases and focusing initial deployment in Austin before expanding to other markets..Edison Yu (Deutsche Bank) inquired about the supply chain challenges for scaling Optimus humanoid robot production given new tariffs. Musk noted that further localization is underway but acknowledged uncertainty about the precise supply chain composition until ramp-up progresses..George Gianarikas (Canaccord Genuity) asked if Tesla will introduce tiered pricing for unsupervised FSD features. CFO Vaibhav Taneja indicated pricing adjustments are under consideration, and Musk said the value of unsupervised autonomy will likely drive future price increases..Colin Langan (Wells Fargo) pressed on technical risks around Tesla’s camera-based autonomy approach in adverse conditions. Musk detailed advances in photon-counting technology to address sun glare and low visibility, arguing that Tesla’s system can outperform human drivers in challenging environments.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-most-interesting-analyst-questions-200406320.html
2025-06-18 03:50:00,"Tesla stock drops as Wells Fargo warns of weak Q2 deliveries, free cash flow under threat","Tesla stock is falling Tuesday as one of the street’s biggest bears is raising alarms over Tesla’s core auto business, and resulting free cash flow.","Tesla stock (TSLA) is falling Tuesday as one of the Street’s biggest bears is raising alarms over Tesla’s core auto business and resulting free cash flow..Wells Fargo's Colin Langan notes that Tesla’s fundamentals are coming in worse than expected. The bank is expecting second quarter deliveries to be down 21% compared to a year ago, with the firm’s 343,000 estimate approximately 17% below street consensus..“New Model Y appears weak given inventory building & promotions. There is also no update on the affordable model, the only driver of 2H [second half of the year] volumes,” Langan wrote in a note to clients. “Order px [pricing] is ~stable, though financing promos & inventory discounts continue. We expect lower margin q/q due to px.”.Tesla shares were down 4% in afternoon trade, underperforming the broader market..Even more pressing in Langan’s analysis was Tesla’s free cash flow metrics, which might go negative in 2025 due to a variety of factors..The Senate’s recent vote ending California’s ability to regulate air pollution was “game over” for the state’s regulatory board, known as CARB, Langan said. The vote means that automakers will no longer need to buy zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) regulatory credits from companies like Tesla to offset CO₂ emissions, which Wells Fargo said could imply a 16% cut to full-year EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). The state of California has sued the federal government, looking to reinstate the ruling..Due to the combination of lower deliveries, lower EV credits, pricing, tariffs, and steady capex spending, “We now forecast FCF [free cash flow] burn of $1.9 billion, the first FCF FY since 2018,"" the note said..Langan is also concerned about Tesla’s robotaxi testing in Austin. “The FSD [full self-driving] testing in Austin seems to be w/in a limited range, at low speed & heavily supervised. We see a risk of ramping up too quickly as an accident would be a major setback,” Langan said..Analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives and Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas believe Tesla’s FSD and robotaxi service are key to unlocking trillions in value, which is notable as Langan himself estimates Tesla currently trades at 172 times 2025 EPS forecasts, a rich valuation..Langan reiterated his Underweight rating and $120 price target. Langan and Wells have been underweight the stock since March of last year and missed the steep run-up in Tesla shares following President Trump’s reelection.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-drops-as-wells-fargo-warns-of-weak-q2-deliveries-free-cash-flow-under-threat-195028628.html

Should You Buy TSLA Stock Now?,Tesla investors are optimistic about the launch of robotaxis in Austin later this month. But is TSLA stock a good buy given its already expensive valuation?,"Tesla’s (TSLA) ambitious robotaxi program received a regulatory boost last week as President Donald Trump’s administration announced a streamlined approval processes for autonomous vehicles, potentially aiding the company’s June 22 launch in Austin, Texas.

Tesla shares surged over 2% on the announcement, reflecting investor optimism about faster regulatory pathways..Musk has been promising an autonomous car for several years and has failed to deliver on each occasion. He has repeatedly missed self-driving deadlines since 2016, when he predicted coast-to-coast autonomous trips would be achieved by 2017. Notably, the Austin pilot will be heavily geofenced and rely on virtual support, marking a departure from earlier promises of unsupervised self-driving in customer vehicles..The program starts modestly with just 10 vehicles in restricted Austin areas, expanding to 1,000 vehicles within months, according to Musk’s projections. Tesla faces competition from Waymo, which already operates in four cities and provides over 200,000 paid rides weekly..Moreover, safety concerns persist given Tesla’s involvement in numerous crashes and near-misses with existing driver assistance features. Critics argue that Tesla is prioritizing optics over thorough validation, given the compressed testing timeline compared to competitors..Tesla’s robotaxi ambitions could unlock substantial value for shareholders if the launch is successful. Analysts suggest the business model, which combines ride-hailing and vehicle licensing, could generate a sizeable revenue stream. Additionally, the regulatory tailwinds from the Trump administration will provide additional support for faster deployment.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-giving-tesla-robotaxis-leg-194531342.html
