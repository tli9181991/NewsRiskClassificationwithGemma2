What is emerging is in fact a significant challenge, one that calls for great attention and foresight in order to project, also in the context of new scenarios, healthy, fair and sound lifestyles, especially for the good of younger generations.""SoftBank is pitching plans for a $1 trillion AI and robotics complex in Arizona.Thats according to Bloomberg.It says the Japanese investor wants to create a U.S. version of Chinas vast Shenzhen manufacturing hub.SoftBank reportedly wants to involve chips titan TSMC, but its not clear if the Taiwan firm is interested.And Goldman Sachs says its rolling out its AI assistant companywide in a bid to boost productivity.It joins other banks in seeking a boost from the bots.Citigroup is already using AI to do tasks like summarizing documents.And Morgan Stanley has a chatbot to help financial advisers talk to clients.","Strategic Risk: -4

Known for its roaring petrol engines, Ferrari has sold hybrid models since 2019 and will begin unveiling its first EV in October this year in a three-stage process culminating in a world premiere in the spring of next year.  Aside from the lack of a throaty roar that comes with an electric sports car - the top selling point for many wealthy buyers - automakers have struggled to overcome the fact that EV batteries are far too heavy and simply lack the sustained power of a fossil-fuel engine.","Strategic Risk: -2

BA,Report slams Boeing over 737 MAX midair blowout,"STORY: ::NTSBU.S. regulators have released their report on the midair blowout last year involving a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines.And it wonât make easy reading for the aerospace giant.The National Transportation Safety Board says Boeing failed to provide workers with the training, guidance and oversight that could have prevented the incident.In comments Tuesday, the Board harshly criticized the firmâs safety culture, and its failure to properly install key bolts when making the jet.::FILENTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the incident was wholly avoidable, as the plane maker should have addressed production issues identified in internal audits going back a decade or more.She said it was ânothing short of a miracleâ that no one was killed or seriously injured in the blowout.The accident left Boeing facing deep crisis.It prompted the Justice Department to open a criminal probe and declare that the firm was in violation of a deferred prosecution deal agreed after earlier fatal crashes.Regulators also capped output of the MAX while the company worked on improving quality.Those restrictions remain in place, crimping production of the companyâs best-selling model.Boeing says it regrets the incident and continues to work on strengthening safety and quality.Itâs redesigning the door plug that led to the blowout.Homendy praised new company chief Kelly Ortberg, but said he had ""his work cut out"" addressing all the issues.The NTSB report also criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying it should have been aware of problems at the firm.The FAA has now increased oversight of Boeing, after saying last year that it was too hands-off in monitoring the company.","Strategic Risk: -10

COIN,Coinbase seeking US SEC approval to offer blockchain-based stocks,"STORY: Coinbase is seeking a green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to effectively launch stock trading via blockchain technology.Its chief legal officer tells Reuters it wants to make so-called âtokenized equitiesâ available to its customers.Tokenized equities are shares of a company that have been converted into a digital token, similar to how cryptocurrencies are traded.Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities.Proponents have said that tokenized equities could reduce trading costs, enable faster settlement and facilitate round-the-clock trading.While critics say there are gaps including the lack of a clear global standard that need to be addressed before these can be commonly traded.A representative for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Coinbase did not say if it had already submitted an official request to the SEC or when a potential product launch might happen.","Strategic Risk: 8

He highlights the Financial Conduct Authorityâs (FCA) recent release of draft rules for stablecoins, custody, and broader crypto regulation, pointing to 2025 as a pivotal year for UK digital asset policy. He also discusses how the UK may benefit from a ""third-mover advantage,"" learning from both US and EU approaches to regulation, and how Coinbase is ramping up its UK presence, with new products and increased visibility expected soon.","Strategic_Risk: 7

DE,US FTC sues Deere over equipment repair restrictions,"(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sued farm equipment maker Deere, alleging it illegally drives up repair costs by forcing farmers to rely on its authorized dealer network.  The lawsuit argues Deere has unlawfully boosted profits by requiring farmers to use its network of authorized dealers for repairs, making it difficult for farmers to use independent mechanics or do repairs themselves, the FTC said in a press release.  The outgoing Biden administration has targeted what it sees as anti-competitive practices in agriculture, ranging from improving the treatment of chicken farmers by meat processing companies to increasing competition in the seed sector.","Strategic Risk: -7

Needham & Company managing director Bernie McTernan joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the sports betting platforms that stand to benefit from this big day. McTernan calls the Super Bowl nearly ""the most important day of the year"" for online betting services. He notes that names such as FanDuel â owned by Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) â and DraftKings (DKNG) have ongoing promotions, each adding a $5 million dollar jackpot individuals can buy into to ""get new customers into the system."" ""What we see over time is that players certainly consolidate their spend,"" he explains to Yahoo Finance, noting that new individuals may use multiple sports betting apps to start but often end up using just one by the end, with FanDuel and DraftKings leading those preferences. ""It's really this flywheel effect where DraftKings and FanDuel, they have the most share. That allows them to invest the most in product and technology, which then drives more share and allows them to invest more,"" he explains to Josh Lipton.
