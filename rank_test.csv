The board harshly criticized Boeing's safety culture and its failure to install four key bolts in a new Alaska Airlines MAX 9 during production, as well as ineffective oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration.  NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a board meeting the incident was entirely avoidable because the planemaker should have addressed unauthorized production that was identified in numerous Boeing internal audits, reports and other forums for at least 10 years.","Strategic Risk: -8

BA,Airbus bags Saudi order as Franco-Israeli dispute rocks air show,"Airbus bagged a $3.5 billion plane order from Saudi Arabia's AviLease on the opening day of the Paris Airshow on Monday, as a diplomatic dispute erupted over France's decision to shut down four Israeli stands for displaying deadly weapons.  Delegates expect this year's iteration of the world's biggest aviation trade show to see less business than usual, partly due to last week's deadly crash of an Air India Boeing 787 and also because Boeing racked up huge deals during U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tour of the Middle East.  But Airbus looks set to close a series of sales on its home turf, and interest in the defence side of the show is high as Europe ramps up military spending and conflict between Israel and Iran escalates.","Strategic Risk: -8

Duffy said he wanted civil aviation to return to a 1979 zero-tariff trade agreement, in one of the clearest signs yet that the Trump administration might favour such a move.  However, Duffy added that while the White House was aware that the U.S. is a net exporter in aerospace, it was also dealing with a complex tariff situation.","Strategic Risk: -5

Under the EUâs new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which came into force earlier this year, member states can issue licences that allow crypto companies to operate throughout the 27-nation bloc, but some have raised concerns in closed-door meetings about the speed with which licences are being granted, two people familiar with those discussions said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.  At stake is the oversight of the multi-trillion-dollar crypto industry, which regulators have long warned could facilitate fraud, market instability and illicit financial flows if it is not properly supervised.","Strategic Risk: 8

GM,GM to invest $4 billion to shift some production from Mexico to the US,"Shares of General Motors rose before the opening bell after announcing plans to invest $4 billion to shift some production from Mexico to U.S. manufacturing plants as the automaker navigates tariffs that could drive prices higher.  President Trump signed executive orders in April, relaxing some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, a significant reversal as the import taxes threatened to hurt domestic manufacturers.  Automakers and independent analyses say the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide.","Strategic Risk: 7

The automaker deployed a small fleet of self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, marking the first time its cars have carried paying passengers without human drivers.  The trial's success is crucial for Tesla as Musk has pivoted the company to self-driving cars and robots, shelving plans for mass-market dominance in the EV space as Chinese competition heats up and demand slows for its aging line-up of models.","Strategic Risk: 8
